The tutoring catch-up programme has bold ambitions-and a tiny budget
IT IS A straightforward process. Go to the National Tutoring Programme website, type in your location and pick a provider. A school in Tyneside can, for instance, choose from 19 options, including tlc Live (a firm offering online tutoring from qualified teachers), the Brilliant Club (a charity providing lessons from PhD students) and White Rose Maths (just maths teaching, from a chain of schools in Yorkshire).
In June, Boris Johnson announced a £1bn ($1.3bn) pupil catch-up fund, with a portion set aside for tutoring. On November 2nd the National Tutoring Programme launched-and not a minute too soon. Children spent the end of the last academic year at home. They have now returned to school, but things are not going entirely to plan. Before the start of half-term, the spread of covid-19 meant that one in eight secondary-school pupils was absent.
English schools have an unusually high degree of autonomy, so the government can't simply order head teachers to hire tutors. Schools have thus been given £650m to aid their efforts to bring children up to speed. Another £76m has been spent establishing the National Tutoring Programme, which is run by a group of charities, and which will subsidise 75% of the cost of tuition, to encourage schools to spend on extra pairs of hands. The government had planned to spend more: the limit is the availability of top-notch providers.
According to research by the Sutton Trust, one of the charities running the scheme, 10% of pupils received tutoring last year, up from 5% in 2009, mostly paid for by parents. The market is something of a Wild West, making it hard to identify high-quality providers. The National Tutoring Programme hopes to impose some order. Only 32 out of the 393 outfits that applied made it through the approval process, which required proof of safety standards and an idea of how to work with schools.
There is plenty of evidence that tutoring is effective, with trials finding that 12-week programmes can lead to the progress that would be expected from three to five months of normal schooling. As Robbie Coleman of the National Tutoring Programme notes, tuition tends to work best when it happens regularly over a longish period, which is why it is offered in 15-hour blocks. The programme will also add to the evidence base. By measuring the outcomes of pupils involved in the programme, and comparing them with similar ones who are not involved, officials will be able to measure which approaches do the most good.
That will help determine the relative effectiveness of, say, online versus in-person tutoring. It could also come in useful if the programme is extended, allowing resources to be directed to better outfits (and thus may help convince the Treasury to stump up the cash). Even before the results are in, the programme has a powerful cheerleader. Speaking at prime minister's questions on November 4th, Mr Johnson hailed the tutoring programme as one of the most innovative ideas to have come out of the crisis, adding that he wanted to see it continue in the post-pandemic era. As more evidence emerges of the distance pupils have fallen behind, support for such interventions is likely to grow. *"

Sir keir starmer's leadership of the Labour Party has taken place entirely in the age of covid-19-he was elected on April 4th-but the politics of the disease have changed completely in that short time. Last time Britain went into lockdown the leader of the opposition was walking on eggshells. Criticism of the government's strategy would have come across as opportunistic or unpatriotic. This time he is riding the surf. Serial incompetence has rendered the government fair game. The sense of national unity, which started to unravel when the prime minister's chief adviser broke lockdown rules, has gone entirely. With the Tories at each other's throats, nobody can object to tough criticism from Labour.
Sir Keir's latest success is the lockdown itself. On October 13th, he started arguing for a two-to-three-week ""circuit break"" to coincide with half term. His position echoed that of sage, the government's team of scientific advisers. Boris Johnson vigorously rejected his advice on the grounds that a full lockdown would be a ""national disaster"". The prime minister then spent three weeks scrambling to make his tiered system work, only to reverse himself and introduce a national lockdown.
This feeds nicely into Labour's main line of attack: that the prime minister's handling of the virus has been slow and clumsy from the beginning. Mr Johnson's volte face makes him look weak and dithering and Sir Keir prescient and decisive. It also gives the Labour leader a licence to be simultaneously for and against the lockdown: whenever anyone mentions the costs of closing the country down he can argue that they would have been lower if only the prime minister had acted sooner. The Conservative Party has devoted a lot of energy to labelling Sir Keir ""Captain Hindsight"". Mr Johnson has transformed him at a stroke into Captain Foresight.
Sir Keir's good call on lockdown coincides with a piece of good fortune: the Equality and Human Rights Commission's strongly worded report on anti-Semitism in the party under the leadership of his predecessor, and Jeremy Corbyn's dismissive reaction to it. Mr Corbyn was swiftly suspended from the party. Chucking out a former leader is a dangerous manoeuvre, particularly when that leader is a hero not just to leathery old leftists but also to young idealists who flooded into the party when he took over in 2015. Moreover, hard leftists are dangerous enemies to have, given their long memories and habit of lurking in the dark corridors of the party machinery, ice picks in hand. But so far the move has paid off, making Sir Keir look tough without sparking a rebellion in the parliamentary party. Mr Corbyn's most vocal supporters consist mostly of has-beens and misfits-indeed, Chris Williamson, one of the most vocal of the lot, was expelled from the party over anti-Semitism. This looks more like the death-rattle of a dying regime than a live threat in the future.
Luck isn't randomly distributed in politics: it goes to the wellprepared and gutsy. Sir Keir has done patient work taking over the party. Rather than drafting old Blairites like Hilary Benn into the shadow cabinet, he has appointed a new generation of mps, and brought enthusiastic young advisers into his office. The parliamentary party is more disciplined than it has been for years. John McTernan, a former political adviser to Tony Blair, points out that the difference between first-rate barristers and also-rans lies in their sense of timing: they know not only which is the most damaging weakness in their opponent's case, but also exactly when to expose it. On everything from the sacking of his leftist rival for the leadership, Rebecca Long-Bailey, from the shadow cabinet- one of his first moves as leader-to the call for a second lockdown, Sir Keir has used the skills he has honed in his career.
Perhaps, given the shambles of Mr Johnson's government, Sir Keir's professionalism, competence and normality will be enough to win him the next election. But thanks to Labour's collapse in Scotland, the electoral mountain he has to climb is far higher than the one that Tony Blair faced in 1997. And the Conservative Party has a distinguished record of getting rid of failing leaders: it is notable that the Labour Party is now shifting its fire from Mr Johnson, who is beginning to have the air of yesterday's man, to Rishi Sunak, his chancellor, who is every bit as normal, professional and competent as Sir Keir.
Labour leaders who have broken long periods of Conservative rule have offered something more than competence: a galvanising vision of the future. Clement Attlee offered to replace the old deviltake-the-hindmost patchwork of benefits with a modern welfare state, and a class-ridden society with a meritocracy. Harold Wilson talked about the ""white heat of the technological revolution"". Tony Blair peddled a third way between socialism and capitalism.
Sir Keir's main initiatives are party-focused and backwardlooking: winning back traditional Labour voters in the Midlands and the north, ridding the party of its unpatriotic image, kicking out anti-Semites. He has said nothing about the great issues that will define the future: how Britain should try to define itself after Brexit, how to head off Scottish independence or even-this is the Labour Party after all-what work will look like when the pandemic is over. ""Technocratic, nasal and boring"" is how a Labour veteran summarises his style.
These are still early days in the Keir era, and the middle of a pandemic might not be the right time to be unveiling shiny new visions of the future. But Sir Keir has given no sign that he is capable of either providing what George Bush senior called ""the vision thing"" or promoting others who can do it for him. Attlee, Wilson and Blair all surrounded themselves with big political beasts who had a keen sense not only of how to gain power, but also of what they wanted to do with it. Labour's top table today is heavy on technocrats but light on gurus. Sir Keir may have cast off the Captain Hindsight label when it comes to the pandemic, but if he is to inspire voters, he will need to persuade his countrymen that he can look beyond the next lockdown."

Russian military forces dazzle after a decade of reform
After the Soviet Union's collapse, Russia's once-mighty armed forces were laid low. Moscow bus drivers outearned fighter pilots. Hungry soldiers were sent to forage for berries and mushrooms. Corruption was rife-one general was charged with renting out a MiG-29 for illicit drag racing between cars and jets on a German airfield. ""No army in the world is in as wretched a state as ours,"" lamented a defence minister in 1994. Yet few armies have bounced back as dramatically. In 2008 Russian forces bungled a war with Georgia. In response, they were transformed from top to bottom.
That began with large sums of money. Russian military expenditure roughly doubled between 2005 and 2018, when measured in exchange rates adjusted for purchasing power. Though much of the budget is secret, Russia's annual military spending probably stands somewhere between $i50bn and $i80bn, says Michael Kofman of the Centre for Naval Analyses, a thinktank in Virginia. That is around three times as much as Britain and close to 4% of gdp.
Much of that money has been spent on kit. In the past decade Russia has added around 600 new planes, 840 helicopters and 2,300 drones, estimates Julian Cooper of the University of Birmingham. Whereas 99% of Russian armour in 2007 was classified as ""legacy""-ie, introduced into service more than three decades ago-today fully 27% is modern, according to a study published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (iiss), a think-tank in London, on September 29th. Russia's warplanes have gone from being 97% legacy to being 71% modern in that time.
The key investments were in precision missiles like the land-based Iskander, sealaunched Kalibr and air-launched Kh-101, putting in range targets across Europe (see map on next page). A decade ago the idea that the Russian navy could accurately hit targets in Syria from warships in the Caspian Sea would have been science fiction, notes Dmitry Stefanovich of imemo, a research institute in Moscow. ""Now it's a reality."" In a European war, the idea would be to use such missiles to threaten civilian and military infrastructure deep behind the front lines on the ground, ensuring that a conflict over, say, Tallinn would stretch far to the west of the Rhine.
Russia's ultimate aim is to create a ""reconnaissance-strike complex""-originally a Soviet idea-in which data from vehicles on the ground, drones in the air, satellites in space and radio signals emitted by enemy units are collected, processed and fed into the weapons in real time. Any ""sensor"" (for instance, a drone) can feed a target to any ""shooter"" (like a faraway ship), with targets prioritised centrally and struck, ideally, within minutes. Though Russia is behind America and probably China in this ambitious endeavour, it has made ""huge leaps"", says Dima Adamsky of idc Herzliya, a university in Israel.
Russian forces are not just better armed, but also more fleet-footed. Thanks to improvements in readiness, Russia could probably get 100,000 troops, complete with heavy armour, to a European hotspot within 30 days. nato might strug- gle to muster half the number, of lighter forces, in that time. Around 5,000 of Russia's airborne troops are said to be on two hours' notice. Soldiers are kept on their toes with huge exercises. The latest, Kavkaz (Caucasus) 2020, involved 80,000 personnel and concluded on September 26th. ""Russia has traded mass for tempo,"" concludes Lt-General Jim Hockenhull, Britain's chief of defence intelligence.
Russia's armed forces enjoy the additional advantage of being blooded in battle. Though Russia and China may have comparable weapons, the quality of the forces, in training and combat experience, is ""night and day"", says Mr Kofman. In Ukraine, for instance, Russia has practised armoured warfare and artillery duels, experimenting with the use of cyber-attacks and drones to feed targeting information to its guns. Syria, where over 63,000 Russian personnel have served, has been a testbed for precision strikes, air defence against rebel drone swarms, and the use of unmanned vehicles.
Russian officers in Syria have even shown signs of shedding the Soviet legacy of rigid, top-down command and acting with more autonomy and creativity, a practice known as ""mission command"", observes Mr Adamsky. That, he says, would be ""a major departure from the Russian military tradition"". And in both countries, Russia has honed its skills in electronic warfare by jamming radios, radars and drones. Russia's fake gps signals in Syria were even strong enough to bamboozle civilian airliners in Israel.
Not everything has been fixed, of course. Viktor Murakhovsky, a former officer who now edits a military journal, is positive about the reforms. But he says that shipbuilding is slow and that the country lags behind its rivals in long-range drones. The new т-14 Armata tank, the next-generation Su-57 warplane and new submarines have all been delayed. Though Russia is adept at blowing things up in space, its ageing fleet of reconnaissance satellites has shrunk over the years, with modernisation complicated by Western sanctions. The biggest problem of all, says Mr Kofman, is the limited capacity of Russia's defence industry, including shortages of skilled personnel, machine tools and components.
The trade-off between hardware and humans is also apparent. Though troops no longer go hungry, their pay is not great. Mr Murakhovsky points out that a skilled tank commander in his 20s can expect little more than 43,000 rubles ($532) a month in peacetime, lower than the national average. ""In my opinion, it's not enough."" Morale among conscripts, who still make up 55% of ground forces, remains low, and the short duration of their service limits their usefulness in combat. Though the days of renting out warplanes may be over, last year Russian military prosecutors announced that 2,800 military officials had been charged with corruption. The amount stolen totalled around $90m.
Nor has military renaissance bought peace of mind. In a war with nato, Russia ""would have conventional superiority for a limited period"", concludes the iiss, but would be outgunned if the conflict dragged on. In recent years, Mr Putin has therefore worked to ensure that a conflict would not drag on. He has invested heavily in nuclear forces, unveiling a host of lurid weapons such as hypersonic gliders, radioactive torpedos designed to pollute coastal areas and nuclear-powered cruise missiles capable of circling the Earth indefinitely. Missiles like the Iskander, Kalibr and Kh-101 can also carry both conventional and nuclear warheads (nato officials point out that they would have no way of knowing which until they landed). For Russian generals, the hope is that their revived strength means that the nukes are never needed.
For its part, nato has largely focused on Russian threats to the Baltic states, and the challenges of reinforcing Europe over weeks and months. It has underestimated how Russia's new firepower may be used in a shorter, sharper and more expansive war that would stretch far beyond the Baltics. Its planners, and the national politicians that set military budgets and priorities, need to adjust their strategies and spending in the light of these new threats. *"

Despite the horrors in Austria and France, jihadism has declined
TEEMING WITH spooks and intrigue, Vienna is no stranger to political violence. ""Carlos the Jackal"" held opec's oil ministers hostage there in 1975. Since then, assassinations in Austria's capital have claimed the lives of Kurds and Chechens, among others. But until November 2nd Vienna had largely been spared the attacks on civilians that have menaced cities like London, Madrid or Paris. That night four people were killed and 23 injured, several of them seriously, during a gun and knife rampage in Vienna's centre. Many were attacked as they took their last chance of a drink or a meal before Austria's second coronavirus lockdown.
The Austrian authorities identified Kujtim Fejzulai, a 20-year-old man with dual Austrian and North Macedonian citizenship, as the sole gunman. Further arrests were made on November 3rd. Mr Fejzulai, who was shot by police, was born and raised in Vienna to Macedonian parents of Albanian extraction. Radicalised as a teenager, in 2019 he was convicted of terrorist offences and given a 22-month prison sentence after authorities thwarted his plan to join Islamic State (is) fighters in Syria. But he was released in December under Austria's lenient rules for young offenders.
The attack follows a spate of terrorism in Europe. On October 4th a Syrian asylumseeker stabbed two men, killing one, in the German city of Dresden in what may have been a homophobic attack. Twelve days later, on the outskirts of Paris, a teenage Chechen refugee beheaded Samuel Paty, a teacher who had shown his class controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad from Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine. On October 29th a Tunisian national who had arrived in France that month killed three people at a church in Nice. On the same day, French police shot dead a man claiming allegiance to a far-right antiimmigrant group near Avignon.
The flurry of attacks recalls the bloodshed of 2015-16, when Islamist terrorists killed 12 people at CharlieHebdo's offices in January 2015, 131 people at multiple sites in Paris in November and 86 people in Nice the following July. Since then, however, jihadism in Europe has declined markedly. The number of completed Islamist attacks fell every year from 2017 to 2019, while the number of foiled ones rose, according to Europol, the eu's law-enforcement agency. Ten people were killed in 2019.
Much of the violence has been associated with is, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014 with the help of 5,000 or so European recruits. The is ""caliphate"" was crushed in 2019 and European security services feared that a flood of returning fighters would overwhelm their ability to monitor suspects back at home. In practice, is veterans have not proven as numerous or violent as feared, even if the group's ideology has remained potent.
Even so, the threat continues to dominate the work of security services. In a speech in October, Ken McCallum, director-general of M15, Britain's domestic-intelligence service, said that Islamist extremism remained the country's largest threat by volume, with ""tens of thousands"" committed to the ideology, though he added that a growing share of plots came from right-wing extremists, like the attacker in Avignon. Mr McCallum said that tracking plots had become harder in recent years ""as more terrorists have gone for basic attack methods requiring little preparation"".
None of the attackers in Dresden, Paris, Nice or Vienna is thought to have reached Iraq or Syria. Though the Dresden suspect had been convicted of recruiting on behalf of is and downloading terrorist manuals, he is believed to have been radicalised only after arriving in Germany five years ago. Mr Paty's killer is known to have had contact with a jihadist in Syria, but he never fought there and was not known to the French authorities. The Nice attacker, who had crossed from Tunisia to Italy in late September, had been arrested in Tunisia for using a knife but was not otherwise on the radar of Tunisian, Italian or French authorities. The problem seems to be less about hardened combat veterans than those with looser ties to the jihadist ecosystem turning to violent action.
Propaganda remains a serious issue, too. Large caches of material inciting and glorifying terrorism continue to circulate freely online, says Julian King, who served as European commissioner for security until January. The European Parliament has been sitting on proposals for Europewide action to remove online propaganda for almost two years, he says.
The recent attacks also highlight another worrying pattern. Mr Fejzulai was let out of prison early; the Dresden suspect had been released only five days before his attack. That reflects a wider failure of counter-terrorism policy, as does the fact that Mr Fejzulai had completed a deradicalisation programme that was evidently unsuccessful. ""In many European countries the priority was to get people locked up,"" says Peter Neumann of King's College London, ""and then to forget about them, with many becoming further radicalised in prison."""

Neither dictator nor protesters are backing down
The young man tore open his coat, threw his arms in the air, and dared the riot cop to open fire. The startled officer retreated, his assault rifle still aimed at the approaching protester. ""Long live Belarus!"" chanted the crowd. It was just another Sunday in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, where the opposition has staged huge rallies every weekend since August 9th, when Alexander Lukashenko, the country's erratic dictator, rigged presidential elections to claim a sixth term.
Despite the bravery of the protesters, Mr Lukashenko, 66, shows no sign of relinquishing power. And as winter approaches, the opposition movement could be slowly running out of options. A nationwide strike called for October 26th by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the exiled opposition leader, has largely crumbled amid a clampdown on picketing and threats of dismissal. Dissenting students have been expelled from university. More than 230 protesters were accused this week of taking part in ""mass disorder""-a charge that could see them incarcerated in a brutal Belarusian prison for up to three years.
Mr Lukashenko has urged security forces to ramp up the violence against protesters. At least five people have already been killed and dozens more have been injured. Speaking recently to security chiefs, he said protesters who confront police should have their arms torn off. ""We're not taking prisoners,"" he said. Days later, security forces used live bullets at a demonstration, firing warning shots into the air. The show of strength was met by sarcastic applause from the crowd of opposition supporters.
The clampdown does not mean that the opposition is going to give up its fight to topple Mr Lukashenko. One in every five urban adults is estimated to have taken part in the protests, and around 85% of them intend to continue demonstrating until new elections are held, according to a poll by Chatham House, a British thinktank. (Independent opinion polls are banned in Belarus.) Ms Tikhanovskaya has called for more protests and fresh strikes to pile economic pressure on Mr Lukashenko. ""Neither side has the strength to decisively turn the tide in its favour,"" said Igor Ilyash, a political analyst in Minsk. ""This is a war of attrition.""
Whatever comes next, it is hard to see how life in Belarus can go back to normal. An entire generation of Belarusians has been politicised by the protests and Mr Lukashenko's frenzied attempts to crush them. ""Where are our guys, dad?"" asked a small child recently, as he gazed at a phalanx of riot police officers. ""Over there, see, with the flags?"" his father reassured him. The video went viral.
Waiting in the wings, should the protesters get the upper hand, is Vladimir Putin. The Russian president has said the Kremlin will intervene in Belarus, Russia's closest ally, if the protests ""get out of control"". Late last month, Russian security officials accused the West of financing the opposition. The comments came as Russian state television used images of widespread destruction from the Nagorno-Karabakh war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in a report on ""aggressive"" protesters in Minsk. Was it a technical error or a bid to swing Russian public opinion in favour of a military intervention in Belarus? Only the Kremlin knows the answer. *"

A controversial plan to water down a government monopoly on booze
Most northern-hemisphere wine is produced at a latitude of between 30° and 50°. Any farther north and it gets too cold. Ahus vineyard, in Skane county on Sweden's Baltic coast, is at a chilly 55.9°. But since 2005 it has been cultivating vines on a hectare of farmland. Last year it produced around 3,000 bottles, mostly from solaris grapes, a variety suited to cooler climes. It also welcomes tourists. This summer saw a rush of interest from Swedish oenophiles holidaying at home because of the pandemic. Visitors would ask, ""Can we buy a bottle as a souvenir?"" says Karin Birch, who helps run the vineyard. ""And I would have to say no.""
In 1955 Sweden replaced a rationing system so ineffective that even the temperance movement opposed it with a state monopoly on alcohol sales. Today 446 shops called Systembolagets are the only places where Swedes can buy alcohol stronger than 3.5%, besides bars and restaurants. Similar monopolies exist in other Nordic countries, and the arrangement remains broadly popular.
The state's grip on booze sales may be about to weaken, however. Last year, in exchange for propping up the minority government, the moderate Centre Party negotiated a consultation on the introduction of ""farm sales"". The policy would allow producers such as Ahus to sell directly to customers. But the idea is controversial.
The iogt-nto, a Swedish temperance movement, claims that farm sales are a Trojan horse that will end up letting big producers flog their wares on the open market, noting that the Swedish farmers' association has argued against putting a size limit on sales. Opponents also argue that farm sales could be illegal under European Union law, though this has yet to be tested. In 1997, two years after Sweden joined the bloc, the European Court of Justice ruled that the monopoly complied with the eu's rules on the free movement of goods, since it did not discriminate against any producers. But farm sales would by their nature exclude alcohol from abroad.
According to Sofia Nilsson, a Centre Party mp for Skane, farm sales are not a way to abolish the state's monopoly by the back door, but could boost tourism and jobs in the countryside. The government consultation will take time, but Ms Nilsson is optimistic: ""I really hope that in a couple of years we can cycle around Skane, stop at a vineyard and buy a bottle of wine for dinner."""

Galicia shows an idiosyncratic region can remain happy in Spain
It is a place apart, a land of mists, forests and long Atlantic rías (inlets); of pilgrim routes to the vast medieval cathedral of Santiago de Compostela; remote from almost everywhere, its people famous for their caginess. Today Galicia stands out for two other reasons. The first is that since democracy arrived four decades ago, it has progressed from being one of the poorest regions of Spain to enjoying an income only slightly below the national average. Its second peculiarity is that like Catalonia or the Basque Country it is a cultural nation but, unlike them, it is one that is comfortable in Spain. Separatism is the pursuit of a fairly small minority.
Its economic success is broad-based. Apart from Europe's largest fishing industry, shipbuilding, dairying and timber, Galicia has two industrial mainstays: Inditex, based near A Coruña, has grown into the world's biggest provider of fast fashion through Zara and its other chains. A vast Citroen plant near Vigo anchors 30,000 car-industry jobs. The regional government has invested European funds in motorways: it is still six hours to Madrid, but it used to take twice as long. A high-speed railway link should be completed by 2022.
There are other factors behind Galicia's success. A tradition of dividing farms among all children led to rural poverty (and emigration) but also to a culture that values private property, the leira (homestead) and hard work. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the president of the regional government since 2009, highlights Galicia's political stability. Mr Feijóo is from the conservative People's Party, which at national level has become increasingly centralist. In Galicia it has adopted a strong regional identity that Mr Feijóo calls Galleguismo. ""We have defended Galicia as a place that has its own language, culture, heritage and special characteristics,"" he says. This has ""halted nationalism"". At an election in July, Mr Feijóo retained his absolute majority of seats in the Galician parliament, another rarity for Spain.
Critics complain that he has failed to halt an exodus of talent, as young professionals seek opportunities abroad. In fact, Galicia has seen more immigrants than emigrants in this century. But it is an ageing society. The dynamism of the coast contrasts with a depopulated interior, prone to forest fires. The covid-19 pandemic, although mild in the region, may expose flaws in the Galician formula (with cases rising, on October 30th Mr Feijóo restricted movement into and out of the main towns). ""The economic model gave priority to cement over knowledge,"" says Xosé Manoel Núñez Seixas, a historian at the University of Santiago de Compostela.
Galicia suffers the vices as well as the virtues of Spanish devolution. It has three airports, where one would do; Gallegos cross the border to Porto in Portugal for many international flights. Politics features localism. Abel Caballero, the mayor of Vigo since 2007, has made a successful political career out of battling Mr Feijóo. He wants the high-speed train to go straight to his city, rather than via Santiago. That would cost €2bn to save just 15 minutes, says Mr Feijóo.
A nationalist party came second in the election. Its leader, Ana Pontón, wants Galicia ""to take our own decisions"" on energy, infrastructure and taxes and ""the right to decide"" on independence. She also wants 50% of teaching to be in Gallego. But most Gallegos seem happy enough with what Mr Feijóo calls ""cordial bilingualism"" rather than the language war of Catalonia. The nationalist vote seems to have a ceiling of about 25%. ""The Gallego has ambitions to lead Spain,"" says Miguel Conde-Lobato, an advertising man in A Coruña. ""We're more interested in captaining the ship than capsizing it."""

In an episode of ""Blackadder, a British historical sitcom, Edmund Blackadder finds himself having to rewrite Samuel Johnson's first-ever English dictionary after his idiot manservant, Baldrick, throws the sole copy on a fire. Time is short, and he has been threatened with gruesome murder if he fails. In desperation, he asks Baldrick for help. Baldrick's definition of ""dog is certainly original: ""Not a cat. When it comes to defining Europe, leaders end up unintentionally channelling their inner Baldrick. Europe is defined by what it is not, rather than what it is.
For some, Europe is-in Baldrickian terms-Not America. Under Donald Trump, the gaps between America and the eu have widened, with the eu seen as a rival on trade and a freeloader on defence. Leaders including Emmanuel Macron, the French president, now think in terms of a specifically European rather than Western civilisation. Both America and the eu may be capitalist democracies, but Europe is greener, more equal and more humane, argued Mr Macron in a speech last year. But not everyone agrees that America is the best example of what Europe is not. Americophiles still lurk in the eu, particularly in eastern Europe, where America has remained hugely popular under Mr Trump.
Typically, these Americophiles prefer a different, but still Baldrickian definition: Europe is Not Russia. Joining the eu was a way for eastern European countries to assert independence from Moscow. During the 1990s and 2000s, Europe was an evangelistic project, open to anyone willing to sign up. Now it is an exclusive one. Expansion is viewed as a burden, rather than an opportunity. The bloc's frontiers must be strictly defined, with those stuck between Europe and Russia having to pick a side, sharpish. Sometimes others decide for them. When discussing the eu's response to Belarus's slide into despotism, Thierry Breton, the French commissioner, said the quiet part out loud when he announced: ""Belarus is not Europe.
Where there is more agreement is on the definition of Europe as Not Africa. Europeans once expanded into Africa; now they fear the reverse. Migration has been a neuralgic issue, but there is an ugly consensus when it comes to Africa: tightly limited legal migration and brutal treatment for anyone who arrives illegally. ""The Scramble for Europe by Stephen Smith, which spells out the prospect of mass migration from Africa into Europe, received effusive praise from Mr Macron, for instance. Sometimes this attitude bleeds into outright racism. During one meeting, a southern diplomat summed up the eu's debates over asylum with a startling ultimatum: Europe needs to decide whether it wants to be black. For all that Europeans argued that Mr Trump was an affront to liberal values, they are not always so different. When it comes to the bloc's policy towards Africa, there are similarities. The only reason ""Build the Wall never caught on in the eu is because the bloc uses the Mediterranean as a moat-one in which nearly 20,000 people have died since 2014.
Not being Africa has been a long-term pursuit. After all, the eu began as a club of five failed and fading empires (plus Luxembourg) working out how to survive. Defining Europe as Not China is a more recent development. China's entry into the World Trade Organisation was supposed to herald an era of westernisation. Instead, Chinese companies snatched intellectual property from Western rivals, while the Chinese government kept its market largely closed even as the eu opened its own. Now leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, worry that a non-democratic power will for the first time have the lead when it comes to technology. Other systemic rivals were more easily disregarded. After the Soviet Union collapsed, it was dismissed as good for beating Nazis in land wars, but bad at producing the good life. To Europeans, American superiority was ultimately fine, since it too was a capitalist democracy. Decadent Europe had the option of matching American wealth and power, but preferred a life of puny armies, long holidays and fat welfare states. China offers no such comfort. The prospect of a technologically superior power coping with problems such as covid-19 better via an abhorrent political system looms in the minds of eu leaders. If Europe struggles to match the results of rival systems then why should people support it?
Perhaps faith would do it. The eu's founding fathers may have been devout Catholics, yet God is absent from its structures. ""Perhaps it was considered better for Europe to be Christian not in letter but in spirit, writes Olivier Roy, a French author, in ""Is Europe Christian? ""Or maybe this pillar of European identity was so obvious that there was no need to carve it in stone. Whether Europe is part of Christendom or a secular endeavour is an emerging fault line in the bloc. It cuts across everything from gay rights to abortion, with governments in a liberal west-and the eu institutions themselves-now set against their illiberal peers in the east. Rather than grapple with this question, a caucus of European politicians have reached an uneasy compromise whereby Europe is simply ""Not Muslim. It is an easy definition to sell. According to Pew, a pollster, the majority of people in Italy, Poland, Greece, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Hungary have an ""unfavourable view of Muslims.
Whatever People Say I'm Not, That's What I Am
A reliance on Baldrick's idiosyncratic method of definition stems from Europe's relative weakness. Where European powers once expected others to bend to its norms-dressed up as universal values, naturally-it now worries about the process happening in reverse. Or, as Ivan Krastev, a writer, puts it: ""Lack of power means universalism becomes exceptionalism. You stress the differences. eu politicians do not want to be a colony of America or China, while some fear Islam or an unpredictable Russia. They end up explaining all the ways Europe does not fit with any system other than its own. Baldrick would be proud, but the eu should not be."

America is changing course. Yet so much about the election result looks remarkably familiar
Liu xiaobo, China's heroic anti-Communist dissident, was a great admirer of American democracy. ""What interests me most"", he once wrote, ""is the obvious evidence of how the American democratic system can correct itself...especially in moments of great crisis."" Shortly after he made that observation, Liu was imprisoned for the rest of his life. Yet the point stands. Viewed from sufficient distance, American voters seem to have again acted decisively in a moment of crisis and removed an incumbent president, something that has happened only once in the past 40 years.
Viewed from up close, the conclusions to draw from the results of the elections on November 3rd are less sweeping. Opinion polls, which showed Joe Biden with a vast lead going into election day, conditioned Democratic hopes and Republican fears for what would happen. Those polls turned out to be off-maybe even more so than they were in 2016.
The result is tight enough that even though Mr Biden seems likely to win enough electoral-college votes to make him the next president, there will be legal challenges, and the cathartic moment when one candidate wins and the other concedes still looks far off. If this is a repudiation of the president, the mechanics of the electoral college meant it is a marginal, equivocal one, which shows the grip of partisanship on the country.
Despite the covid-19 epidemic, turnout was the highest it has been since 1900- meaning that Mr Biden won more votes than any other candidate in American history. The states that run federal elections have yet again been unable to count votes as quickly as other big democracies manage to. In its general election last year, India counted 600m votes in a few hours, compared with the days it will have taken to tally about 140m votes in America. Yet so much was uncertain in the administration of this election, including the widespread use of voting by mail for the first time in some states, that such high turnout is still an achievement worth celebrating, even if it was mainly a product of something approaching existential terror on both sides.
High turnout did not, however, deliver the dividend that Democrats, as well as most analysts, were expecting. Since at least 2004, the last time a Republican won the popular vote, Democrats have assumed that high-turnout national elections are necessarily good for their party. And Mr Biden did win the popular vote comfortably, underlining the Democrats' status as the party consistently favoured by a majority of American voters. This extends the Democratic run in the popular vote to seven of the past eight presidential elections, an achievement that receives no prize beyond the ability to claim that the country is not really as conservative as it seems. But increased turnout did not favour Mr Biden decisively. Instead, a cast of occasional voters who sat out 2016 made their voices heard and, in the end, came close to cancelling each other out.
That in turn underlines a second striking feature of the result, which is the degree to which 2020 looks like almost any other recent presidential election. North Carolina and Pennsylvania will not report definitively for a while. But thus far, with a few exceptions-notably Florida and possibly Arizona-the electoral map (see next page) looks much as it did in 2012, when Barack Obama narrowly beat Mitt Romney. Despite everything that has happened over the past four years, in other words, this race ended up looking very much like what would occur if a generic Republican ran against a generic Democrat in a year when not much of note took place.
This is remarkable when you pause to remember all the things that have failed to break the partisan deadlock in 2020. Over the past year Donald Trump has been impeached by the House of Representatives, making him only the third president in American history to suffer this rebuke. Covid-19 has killed more than 230,000 Americans and caused the economy to oscillate wildly. The country saw well-publicised killings of unarmed African-Americans by police officers, the largest civil-rights protests in American history and episodes of violence in some cities.
California suffered awful wildfires, farright thugs plotted to kidnap the governor of Michigan and the president had perhaps the worst first-debate performance ever seen. The president also nominated a third Supreme Court judge, securing a conservative majority on the highest court for decades to come. Hunter Biden's laptop divulged its emails after the president's lawyer somehow made sure it found its way to a friendly tabloid. At the end of all that, hardly any Americans had changed their mind about who they wanted to be the next president. It is possible to argue that all these things simply cancelled each other out. More likely, they were made irrelevant by the power of partisan bias to shape how voters interpret such events.
American elections used to be able to deliver landslides in moments of great turmoil. They no longer can. Ever since Ronald Reagan beat Walter Mondale by 525 electoral-college votes to 13 in 1984, though, partisan attachment has been growing in strength to the point where voters overwhelmingly vote the way they did last time, irrespective of the candidate, the policies, or what is going on in the country or the world. More than 90% of voters who voted for Mr Trump in 2016 had voted for Mr Romney four years earlier. Despite all the attention on Never-Trumpers, it is a safe bet that more than 90% of those who voted for Mr Trump in 2016 did so again this year. The president's approval rating has barely budged in the past four years. Both sides dream of delivering a knockout blow that will allow them to govern as they wish; neither can manage more than a few jabs.
Hispanic lessons
The small number of voters who did switch in key states this time will be the object of fascination and study, as more data become available (hard-core election nerds will base their findings on the American National Election Study, which will be released in January). In 2016 the ObamaTrump voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin were almost outnumbered by the journalists and sociologists who set forth to study them in their natural habitat. County-level results from 2020 suggest that Hispanic Republican voters may get the same treatment this time.
That group delivered the president both Florida and Texas. The Sunshine State now looks more like a reliably Republican place than a true swing state. In Texas Democrats are once again left arguing that demographic change will hand them the state at some unspecified point in the future-an argument that the party has been making to reassure itself for too long (the best expression of this optimistic thesis, ""The Emerging Democratic Majority"" by John Judis and Ruy Teixeira, is now almost 20 years old).
Democrats seemingly have to learn the same lesson over and over again: that Hispanic voters are not monolithic and that a more welcoming policy towards immigrants does not automatically translate into more votes from immigrants. In fact, county-level returns suggest the best predictor of a swing towards Mr Trump was the presence of lots of Latino voters.
Conversely, the best predictor of a swing towards Mr Biden was the clustering of college-educated Americans. In demographic terms, the story of the election is therefore a slight lessening of racial polarisation (the phenomenon of minority voters attaching themselves to the Democratic Party) and a slight increase in educational polarisation (the phenomenon of collegeeducated voters deserting the Republican Party). It is unwise to plot trend lines far into the future, but this looks like good news for the future prospects of Republicans, given how diverse the country is becoming, and given that only 36% of Americans have a bachelor's degree.
Telling it how it isn't
Despite their relatively small number, college graduates have disproportionate cultural sway in America. This tends to distort perceptions of what the country is really like, both from inside America and from outside. A very large share of college-educated Americans believed that Mr Trump was both a disastrous president and also a threat to America's governing institutions. They also believed he was a racist, whose dog-whistles about immigrants and African-Americans would make him toxic to non-whites. This view is not as widely shared as they assumed it was.
Why might that be so? A survey from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, earlier this year found that ""strong liberals"" were the only ideological group in the country who felt free to express their political opinions without causing offence. Everyone else, from regular liberals to ""strong conservatives"", felt somewhat muzzled by the political culture in which they sought to express those opinions. If this is accurate, there may be no amount of reweighting that can make polls accurate. A further, possibly related problem for prognosticators is that a lot of voters just do not trust pollsters enough to answer their questions: in 2016 fewer than 1 in 200 calls made by polling firms resulted in an interview with a voter. The same will probably have been true this time.
Mr Biden, then, looks set to become the 46th president, but by a narrow margin. His just-about victory will reignite a longrunning argument in the Democratic Party about whether left-wing populism might be a better antidote to right-wing populism, a dispute that Mr Biden's victory in the primaries seemed to have put to rest. The result looks likely to keep the Republican Party in thrall to Mr Trump and Trumpism for the foreseeable future (see Lexington). And it means that Mr Biden, if he is indeed sworn in come January 20th, will be highly constrained when it comes to domestic policy (see next story). Yet if the president it elects is the most visible measure of its values, America really has changed course. *"

WASHINGTON, DC
Divided and divisive government is here to stay
Forget nuking the filibuster, packing the Supreme Court and dismantling the electoral college-the prizes that bold Democrats salivated over after their expected landslide victory. Those dreams are now dead. The pre-existing Democratic majority in the House of Representatives has weakened, though it has still held. The Senate, on the other hand, looks likely to remain in Republican control, even though some results are yet to be finalised. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader who coasted to a seventh term representing Kentucky, was perfectly content to stymie Barack Obama for years. At 78, he would probably remain set in his ways if Joe Biden has indeed won a narrow presidential victory. That promises another four years of gridlock and hyper-partisan dysfunction. Forget, too, the chance of a green-infrastructure plan, a reform of health care-or much serious legislating of any sort.
Opinion polls not only overstated Mr Biden's national standing, but also the prospects for down-ballot Democrats. In races for the House of Representatives in 2018, Democrats captured a resounding 54% of the votes cast for either major party. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, thought she would be surfing another blue wave. But preliminary results suggest that in 2020 that national margin actually shrank by four percentage points to near-parity. Given that Mr Trump is facing a clear loss in the popular vote, that suggests that downballot Republicans overperformed relative to the president all over the country.
Two years ago, Democrats were excited by their pickups in moderate, suburban districts in unexpected places like Oklahoma City, Charleston in South Carolina and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. All of those seats have now reverted to Republican control, while Democrats did not really manage to add to their territory elsewhere (excepting a pair of open seats in North Carolina). There will probably be more Republican flips, but election projectors think that the Democratic majority in the chamber will survive, even if it is eroded.
Great expectations for the Senate were similarly dampened once results came in. The two most endangered Republican incumbents-Martha McSally of Arizona and Cory Gardner of Colorado-lost as expected, as did Doug Jones, the improbable Democratic senator from Alabama. That left 47 Democratic seats, four short of a majority (or three if a Democratic vice-president broke ties). Some races are still uncalled, but the maths look likely to work for Republicans. Susan Collins of Maine won a comfortable victory and Thom Tillis of North Carolina looks likely to have got a narrow one. More long-shot opportunities for the Democrats, like capturing seats in Iowa and Montana, were decisively beaten back. And their more improbable map-expansion projects failed miserably.
At least $i00m was raised to unseat Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, who nonetheless won by 14 percentage points. ""This is the worst return on investment in the history of American politics,"" gloated Mr Graham in his victory speech. Neither did the $88m raised in Kentucky to unseat Mr McConnell look well-spent: he cruised to a 21-point victory. The ultimate composition of the Senate might not be decided until Georgia holds run-off elections in January-though these are probable Republican holds.
Most modern presidents have had unified party control of Congress at the start of their term (before voters usually wrench it back in mid-term elections). Should Mr Biden win, he is unlikely to be afforded that. This means that much of his ambitious agenda-and much of the all-consuming policy debate during the Democratic primary about which shade of health-care reform was best-will in effect become moot. Mr Biden would preside not over a realign- ment of American politics, but an interregnum between Trumpism and something else. Bipartisan accord might not stretch beyond infrastructure spending, if even that. A resuscitated Republican worry about debts and deficits would probably hamstring any serious spending legislation of a Biden presidency, just as happened with much of the Obama presidency.
With such a narrow result, the hope that America might be able to move beyond its high-stakes, ultra-partisan legislating seems to be extinguished. ""Cry more, lib"", was the first public statement of Madison Cawthorn, a 25-year-old newly elected Republican congressman from North Carolina. A vocal supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia, will soon be seated in Congress. The moderate Democrats who helped secure a large House majority in 2018 were the first to get wiped out.
America's rickety constitutional design gives big rewards for even razor-thin margins. This encourages partisans to stay in their trenches until the next contest, and to sabotage as much as possible the ambitions of the other side. Nothing has happened this time to change that. Even if the next president is not yet confirmed, you can confidently predict how much will get done in the next Congress: very little. *"

Donald Trump sues to stop vote-counting and toss ballots
Watching his re-election odds falter in the Midwest on November 4th, Donald Trump pulled out a backup plan: salvation through litigation. ""We'll be going to the US Supreme Court, he said in the wee hours after election day, repeating a weekslong mantra justifying a rush to install Amy Coney Barrett into the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg's chair. Continuing to count ballots is ""a fraud on the American public, he declared, without explanation. ""We want all voting to stop.
The scattershot legal strategy that emerged hours later carried an air of desperation and included, as promised, a quest to stop counting ballots in states where Mr Trump was in the lead and perhaps in some where he was behind. Mr Trump and his supporters have now filed suits in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign claims, rogue officials are opening ""a backdoor to victory for Joe Biden. Further suits may come in Arizona. However, the barrage of litigation is no more likely to change the president's fortunes than his tweet announcing he would ""hereby claim the state of Michigan, where Mr Biden had already eked out a win.
Mr Trump's lawyers and allies are particularly busy in Pennsylvania, where the president has also declared victory prematurely. The hoped-for win relies on at least five lawsuits. Four of them are rather small potatoes. The Trump campaign is appeal- ing a judge's one-paragraph dismissal of its complaint that campaign workers sent to observe vote-canvassing were denied sufficient access. Twin suits in state and federal courts involve mail-in voters seeking to correct errors such as a missing envelope or mismatched ballot signature; the opportunity to ""cure"" a ballot, according to one filing, entails a ""high risk of jeopardising the integrity"" of the election. Another suit contends that Pennsylvania ballots that lack proof of identification should be thrown out if not fixed by November 9th.
Such efforts aim to give Mr Trump small advantages. None of them seems destined to alter the president's electoral prospects or get a hearing in America's Supreme Court. The Nevada state supreme court rejected a canvassing-observation complaint on November 3rd, finding that observers for the Trump campaign had plenty of access. A judge on November 4th seemed unimpressed with one of the ballot-curing challenges. Didn't the Pennsylvania legislature, the judge asked, intend to ""franchise, not disenfranchise, voters?""
A battle with higher stakes for the Pennsylvania race is Republican Party of Pennsylvania v Boockvar, a case that has seen two visits to the Supreme Court and is now back for a third. The matter involves the Pennsylvania state supreme court's order in September, amid the pandemic, to allow a three-day extension to the receipt deadline for mail-in ballots. Republican challengers could not persuade five justices that this move was an illegitimate usurpation of the state legislature's will. They tried and failed again one week later, when the newly minted Justice Barrett chose not to participate in the matter.
But on October 28th, in a separate opinion involving the case's second trip to the court, three justices told Pennsylvania's Republican Party that it may have better luck asking a third time. Accepting the invitation, the Trump campaign has joined the suit with the hope of shredding any ballots arriving after election day.
If the presidential election comes down to Pennsylvania, stemming votes trickling in by November 9th-ballots that are helping Mr Biden erase his deficit-might be just what Mr Trump needs to hold on to a slim lead and win 20 critical electoral votes. But it may not come to that if Mr Biden finds his way to 270 votes without the Keystone State. Efforts to halt voting in Michigan, throw out a small stack of mail-in ballots in a single Georgia county or force a recount in Wisconsin, where Mr Biden has a 20,000-vote advantage, all seem quixotic.
Mr Trump won the White House four years ago with a brash, take-no-prisoners campaign. He seems intent on losing it-if the 2020 election comes to that-in much the same posture. *"

ON THE MORNING of election day, The Economist's election-forecasting model gave Joe Biden a i9-in-20 chance of winning the presidency. Once all the votes are tallied, Mr Biden will probably be sitting behind the Resolute Desk next year. But it will be by a much closer margin than we forecast.
As we went to press, Mr Biden had amassed 253 electoral votes. He looks to be holding leads in enough states to bring his margin up to 270-the bare threshold needed to win. He could well pick up another 20 votes in Pennsylvania as mail-in ballots are tallied. That is still quite shy of the 356 we predicted.
Simply put, this is because the president did much better than the dismal showing the opinion polls expected. Mr Biden may win Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, whereas polls suggested he was ahead by eight. The model incorporated similarly large misses in Ohio, Iowa and Florida.
Depending on how the remaining states finish, Mr Biden is expected to win one of 270, 290 or 306 electoral votes. A showing at 270 would be outside our 95% confidence interval for the range of outcomes, meaning that our level of certainty was too high. The other likely outcomes would be at the bottom end- what could be expected in one out of every three or four of simulations we ran.
The Economists model had found that Mr Biden was comfortably ahead in so many places that it was hard to envisage him losing them all. But he may have come close. Our errors may reflect a general weakness of quantitative models: they try to predict the future by extrapolating from the past. Perhaps this election, held in the midst of a pandemic and a volatile economy, stretched this assumption too far.
Usually polling errors do not follow the last election's pattern because pollsters try hard to correct their mistakes. Yet the polls still overestimated the positions of Mr Biden and Hillary Clinton in mostly the same states-and often by similar magnitudes.
One worrying possibility is that surveys again did not accurately gauge the share of working-class whites who supported Mr Trump. Before the election, polling showed that they had shifted towards Mr Biden. But preliminary election returns indicate that counties with lots of white working-class voters actually swung further towards Mr Trump. This suggests that Trump-supporting working-class whites were less likely to respond to pollsters in the first place. Should that theory prove true, it would present a very serious problem for the polling industry to solve."

In state and local elections, health and social policy still matter
If you want to see where the momentous events of 2020 had their biggest impact, look not at the national contest but at the governors' races and local referendums. Covid-19 and other traumas turned competitive races into walkovers and showed that states could still push through social changes even while the country is counting every last vote.
Governors have been the dominant figures of the pandemic response, choosing when and how to lock areas down. As a result, gubernatorial races often turned into referendums on states' responses to covid-19. Take the contests in New England, where Democrats might have fancied their chances of unseating one or both Republican governors up for re-election, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Phil Scott of Vermont. Mr Biden won both states easily. But on covid-19, the governors were the unTrumps. When the president told Americans not to be afraid of covid, Mr Sununu shot back, ""I'm afraid of covid. I think everyone should be very concerned."" Mr Scott even endorsed Bill Weld, Mr Trump's rival in the Republican presidential primary. Both earned sky-high approval ratings for handling of pandemic; both won reelection in blue states by over 30 points.
There was a similar story in North Carolina, where the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, won by four points in a state where the presidential and Senate races were in essence tied. Mr Cooper, an affable centrist, won plaudits for taking the pandemic seriously from the start. His Republican challenger, in contrast, criticised the health restrictions and mask-wearing.
The only governorship which changed hands (out of 11 races) was in a state where covid-19 policy was barely mentioned. This was Montana, where the Democratic incumbent was term-limited and ran for a Senate seat. Neither candidate for governor made the pandemic an issue, though Montana now has the fourth-highest covid caseload, relative to its population, in America. In the absence of debate, the state reverted to its habitual hue, with Republicans winning every statewide office.
Just as only one governorship changed hands, so only four state houses seemed likely to switch party, the fewest since 1946 (a handful were undecided as The Economist went to press). Democratic hopes of winning the Texas and Michigan legislatures came to naught. The 2020s will see a new round of redistricting, to Democrats' dismay. Republicans will gerrymander five times as many state maps as they will.
The political impact of covid-19-and of that other upheaval of 2020, the Black Lives Matter (blm) movement-was clearest in the state and local ballot initiatives put to voters. There were fewer than usual, about 120 state ones, because lockdowns made it harder to collect the signatures required to get proposals on the ballot. Of those that got through, many tackled health and racial inequalities. Surprisingly, voters tended to approve socially liberal proposals, while rejecting conservative ones.
Two Californian referendums showed the contrast in criminal-justice policy. A proposition permitting felons on parole to vote passed. One that would have toughened sentencing failed. Six cities asked voters to approve or expand the powers of independent panels to oversee local police forces. All passed, including in Columbus, Ohio, a state Mr Trump won easily.
Amy Liu, who tracks state and local governments for the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, argues that cities and states are still able to make social policy through ballot initiatives, despite paralysis at the federal level. Coloradans approved state-wide paid family leave and repealed a constitutional provision that kept property taxes low. A majority of Floridians backed Mr Trump-and a hike in the hourly minimum wage from $8.56 to $15 by 2026.
Even so, there are limits to state progressivism. In Illinois, a constitutional amendment to change the state's flat-rate income tax to a graduated one (which would have raised taxes on the wealthy) went down to defeat. The governor, J.B. Pritzker, spent millions of his family fortune backing the idea. His cousin, Jennifer Pritzker, spent hers defeating it. Partisanship may be less hyperbolic in state politics but families are still deeply divided. *"

It has become a cliché of liberal editorialising to demand that voters repudiate Donald Trump's populist platform as well as the president himself. Wherever the final vote tallies land, it will be hard to argue that they have.
At the time of writing, Mr Trump looked on course to lose his reelection bid with the second-highest number of votes ever recorded. He seemed to have achieved that feat mainly by turning out the most characteristic parts of his coalition in force. White workingclass men, in particular, cemented the Republicans' hold on some of the territory he took for them in 2016. Mahoning County in Ohio-which is dominated by hardscrabble Youngstown, whose construction sites your columnist visited on the trail-went Republican for the first time since 1972.
The president's populist rhetoric-his hounding of elites and foreigners, his race-baiting-also proved to be much less of a turnoff generally than the Democrats had hoped. Bumper support from Cuban-Americans in Florida and Mexican-Americans in southern Texas saw Mr Trump more than double his winning margin in the first state and kill off Democratic dreams of winning the second. Exit polls suggest he increased his share of support from every group except white men. If that is right, Democrats won the election chiefly through their improved turnout effort, not by wooing voters from Mr Trump.
And this, to recap, was after an election campaign that had featured the president at his worst. In the midst of a deadly pandemic, he derided public-health experts and ridiculed his opponent for following their advice. He gave nodding support to a conspiracy theory which holds that Democrats are devil-worshipping paedophiles. He called Kamala Harris-foe Biden's black, female, running-mate-a ""monster. It is not hard to see why Mr Trump's opponents consider the results too close. Yet their hopes of a full-on repudiation, encouraged by a dose of hubris as well as by rotten polls, now appear unrealistic.
Contemporary nationalist populists-such as Andrzej Duda in Poland or Viktor Orban in Hungary-and American presidents alike tend to win re-election. By that measure, merely dislodging Mr Trump would represent an achievement. And Mr Biden's campaign message, it should be noted, was almost entirely devoted to the vital importance of doing exactly that. If the result was not a crushing rejection of Mr Trump, it seems nevertheless to have been a rejection.
For those who worry about the endurance of Mr Trump's strain of populism, it should also be noted that it is not altogether clear what it is. After his victory in 2016, Trumpism looked like a rallying-call to the economically distressed. Mr Trump fought this campaign on his claim to have built ""the greatest economy in the history of our country. A mixture of isolationism, cronyism, nativist rhetoric, somewhat performative authoritarianism, corporate tax cuts and personality cult, Trumpism is what the president says it is. No one finds this more frustrating than the small minority of Republicans-including Senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio-who have attempted to turn the party into an actual vehicle for the working-class concerns Mr Trump raised. Arguably he has thereby emerged as the main obstacle to the conservative movement he inspired.
His influence may prove to be most enduring if those frustrated adherents take over in his wake. Mr Rubio and the rest appreciate that the pre-Trump party had become detached from its main supporters. And the president has normalised protectionism and other policies that they like. But there is no reason to assume a populist successor to Mr Trump would persist with his race-baiting and thuggery-or, at least, get away with it so easily if he did. Another oddity of the president is how voters who would normally balk at such bad behaviour have given him a pass. Mr Trump, a loudmouthed celebrity for 40 years, is in that sense a political one-off.
This should be somewhat reassuring to his critics in both parties. Mr Trump has transformed the right-but his influence may be less enduring than these results suggest. In a polarised environment, they probably represent less of an endorsement of him even on the right than it seems. His low approval rating suggests he has again been backed by Republicans who dislike him, but cannot bear to vote for the alternative. The logic of such hyper-partisanship is that, once he is out of office, many Republicans will shift their allegiance to a new leader, and be influenced by him in turn.
Yet there is still plenty in the election verdict to worry Trumpism's opponents. Above all, the president's success in broadening his coalition points to their own weaknesses. Democrats will probably take from this that they should have offered Hispanics a better economic message and done more campaigning among them. They say this after most elections. Yet after a campaign almost entirely governed by negative partisanship on both sides, Democrats should think harder about how they may have actively repelled their flagging non-white base.
Populist polarisation
Cuban-Americans are hostile to socialism, a label the Democratic left proudly wears. Mexican-Americans care less about Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric than Democrats-in the face of much evidence to the contrary-persist in believing. A doggedly upwardly mobile community, Hispanics do not generally consider themselves to be the downtrodden minority the left refers to them as. The Democrats will not be a reliable alternative to right-wing populism unless they correct such errors and widen their appeal.
In the current polarised environment, anything less than full control of the government is a recipe for deadlock and disaffection. It was the enabling condition for Mr Trump. That America appears to be headed for another bout of divided government is therefore hard to celebrate."

OTTAWA
The country's economy has rebounded faster than expected. But its labour market, like Europe's, still depends on the government
Canada's economy is often subject to unfavourable comparisons with that of the United States, but recently it has been rivalling its neighbour's. Like the United States it has recently enjoyed a big improvement in economic sentiment. In July the Bank of Canada predicted that at the end of 2020 gdp would be 6.8% smaller than a year earlier; on October 28th it revised that forecast to a 4.3% hit.
By many measures, Canada's labour market seems to be rebounding even faster than America's; in September Canadian employment was only 3.7% beneath its prepandemic peak, while in the United States jobs remained 7.1% scarcer, calculate economists at td Bank (see chart). Yet the country has not quite overhauled Uncle Sam in the quest for a v-shaped recovery from the spring slump. That may be because, as in Europe, many of its jobs remain propped up by the government.
In the spring Canada had a tight lockdown and a big fall in gdp, of over 11% (compared with about 9% south of the border). But in the recovery it has benefited from several advantages. For most of the year it has been relatively successful in controlling the spread of covid-19. Unlike nearly all American states, Canadian provinces can run operating deficits. They have used their borrowing powers to boost hiring of teachers and health-care workers during the pandemic. Provincial deficits are expected to rise to C$96bn ($72bn), 4.5% of Canada's gdp, this financial year, from C$18bn in 2019. American states, by contrast, are having to slash spending as tax revenues have fallen.
In Washington, disagreement over whether to bail out the states has impeded the passing of a second round of fiscal stimulus. But Canada has reduced for now the usual friction between province and nation. The federal government has given the provinces an extra C$21bn to reopen schools and cover extra health-care costs.
In August Doug Ford, the Conservative who governs Ontario, the most populous province, praised Justin Trudeau for doing ""an incredible job as prime minister"". Overall, the 16% of gdp Canada has spent stimulating the economy is even bigger than the United States' massive package of 14% of gdp. ""I don't like deficits. But the alternatives were much worse,"" said Erin O'Toole, the recently elected leader of the opposition Conservatives.
The expansion in Canadian education and health care has helped women, who are most of the workforce in those sectors. Mothers, who were likelier than others to stop work during the pandemic, returned when schools and day-care centres fully reopened in September. Paid holidays are relatively generous. During the pandemic federal and provincial governments, which regulate different sectors, extended the amount of unpaid leave that parents and other workers could take. Many allow them as much time as they want. That stopped their employers from sacking them even when they could not work. Women have still lost more working hours than men in Canada, but the gap is smaller than in the United States, says Beata Caranci, td Bank's chief economist.
The number of jobs in e-commerce has jumped, as shopping shifts away from the high street. That has also happened in the United States, but Canada started out with fewer such jobs, and so the room for growth is bigger. Although the weak energy market has hurt oil-pumping Alberta, prices of natural resources such as gold, copper and lumber have stayed high. The housing market has been buoyed by buyers who reckon the shift to working from home is permanent and want larger dwellings. In all, ""eight of 20 major industrial sectors are now operating above their ago writes Doug Porter, chief economist of bmo, a bank.
Growing confidence may explain why the government felt bold enough to raise its immigration target on October 30th by 17%. Next year it plans to invite more than 400,000 permanent residents, more than 1% of the population. The last time it welcomed that many immigrants was in 1913.
Despite this, most forecasts, including those of the imf and the Bank of Canada, show that Canada will return to its prepandemic level of gdp only after the United States does. The disparity between the labour-market statistics and gdp may reflect the fact that unproductive jobs are being propped up by government subsidies. In September 1.7m employees, or about 8% of Canada's pre-pandemic labour force, were benefiting from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy programme, which contributed an average of more than C$1,000 per employee to firms' monthly payroll costs. About a fifth of these workers are in the troubled hospitality sector. Although the United States also has a scheme to subsidise payroll costs among small businesses, its reach is narrower and it closed to new applicants in August. Canada's scheme is being extended, with a smaller payout, until next June. In this respect Canada looks more like Europe, where job-support schemes have obscured labour-market weakness but not falls in output.
And the virus is again on the rise. As provinces and cities reintroduce restrictions they are trying to minimise their economic impact. That may be tricky. Winnipeg, where the highest temperature on an average day in January is -11°C (u°F), is drawing up rules to allow pubs and restaurants to serve outdoors throughout the winter. The uncertain path of the virus could yet dash both economic and epidemiological hopes, as it has elsewhere. But among rich countries Canada has so far performed well on both fronts."

MANAUS
How e-commerce works in the rainforest
When you behold the Lion of Judah you do not think ""e-commerce"". Its lower decks have hooks for 467 hammocks where passengers sleep on the three-day voyage up the Amazon river from Manaus, a city of 2m people, to Uarini, a manioc-growing town. Its upper deck has more hammocks, a bar for sinners and a chapel for saints. Its cargo hold stinks of fish. But when the Amazon's largest department store, Bemol, started delivering to customers in the rainforest, three-decker passenger boats were its chosen means of transport.
Bemol was founded in 1942 by three grandsons of a Moroccan Jewish immigrant who arrived in Brazil in 1887. It sold fridges and televisions in the traditional way from its megastores in Manaus until 2018, when one of the founders' grandsons, Denis Minev, took over. He suspected there were hundreds of thousands of customers up and down the Amazon and its tributaries that Bemol wasn't reaching and decided to go to them.
But delivering parcels in the rainforest is difficult and expensive. (Amazon the company barely serves its namesake river.) Consumers in far-flung places either had to pay up to 30% of the product's price for shipping and wait a month or longer for the postal service to deliver it or spend money and time on shopping trips to Manaus. Mr Minev made what sounded like an impossible promise: to deliver an order placed online within a week for not a centavo more than the ""Manaus price"".
Bemol calls its answer to those problems caboclo e-commerce. A term for Brazilians with both indigenous and European ancestry, caboclo has come to mean a mix of tradition and modernity. Mr Minev's experience at a cooking-gas firm, also owned by his family, showed him how challenging the Amazon's logistics could be. Rather than buy a fleet of boats, risking collisions, fuel theft and high debt, Mr Minev outsourced delivery to the brightly painted ferries that carry people and provisions around the region.
As the Lion of Judah lay at anchor in the port of Manaus on a recent Tuesday, deckhands stuffed its hold with hundreds of cases of beer, thousands of cartons of eggs, scores of frozen chickens and three squawking ones. Alongside them were near-identical mattresses, supplied by Bemol, to be left in different towns. Contracts with boat owners are verbal, inventory is recorded with pen and paper and mix-ups happen. If merchandise goes missingsmartphones can disappear-Bemol swallows the loss. Just a few boats and their crews serve each route. ""If I fight with all of them, there's no one left to deliver our products,"" says Fred Galvāo, who runs logistics for Bemol.
To encourage Amazonians to place their first online orders, Bemol installed Wi-Fi in the plaza of every town where it launched caboclo e-commerce. It set its catalogue to pop up on users' smartphones and grants free minutes to those who place orders. Like Amazon, Bemol sends customers adverts based on the data they provide.
It invented some tactics to suit the region. Amazonians who lack savings or credit cards use zero-interest loans starting at 150 reais ($26) to finance their purchases; a whopping 85% of Bemol's online sales are paid for this way. Shoppers who are uneasy about using the internet can place orders and lodge complaints with an attendant's help at chemists and floating petrol stations. Bemol allows returns, but encourages customers to accept vouchers instead. ""The traditional e-commerce model without a physical presence doesn't work in the Amazon,"" says Mr Minev.
His caboclo model seems to. Its pilot operation in Autazes, 100km (60 miles) downriver from Manaus, which started in April last year, brought in 113 orders and 73,000 reais in its first month. By February this year Bemol had expanded to dozens of towns. It booked 2.6m reais in sales that month. After the pandemic struck, business boomed. Bemol's e-commerce revenues in June reached 10.5m reais. ""Amazon lost money for years,"" Mr Minev says. ""We're already profitable.""
The Lion of Judah has been less lucky. At the start of the pandemic, it stayed in port for two weeks while ambulance boats brought covid-19 patients and the bodies of those who had died on the journey. The Lion resumed sailing in April but with half as many passengers. The captain, Richard Lacet, who inherited the boat from his father, has made up for lost revenue by charging more for cargo, to squawks from merchants sending chickens upriver and farmers dispatching manioc flour down it. But Bemol, which pays a flat rate for its own compartment, ""is starting to change the business"", he says. E-commerce could keep the Lion afloat. *"

After the pandemic struck Chile, ten do-gooding organisations formed Fondo Respuesta Comunitaria (the Community Response Fund) to alleviate hunger and poverty. It provides money for some 200 projects, mostly ollas comunes (soup kitchens). In Colombia the Fundación Santo Domingo is giving 100bn pesos ($26m) to pay for groceries and a domestic-abuse hotline, among other things. The Fundación Carlos Slim, backed by Mexico's richest man, earmarked 1bn pesos ($47m) to treat covid-19 in that country.
The pandemic has given a boost to philanthropy in Latin America, but it is also a threat. Donors have less money to give or are shifting it to public health from other good causes. Almost half of ngos in Chile may not survive, fears Sylvia Eyzaguirre of the Centro de Estudios Públicos, a think-tank. Prospects are as gloomy in Colombia, where many charities depend on events like galas and bingo nights, which cannot happen in covid times. In too many countries bureaucracy and politics add to the burdens. For the sake of its political and social health, Latin America needs more charitable activity, not less.
Philanthropy is fragile in part because it is less deeply rooted than elsewhere, notably the United States and Europe. In colonial times the Catholic church cured the sick and helped the poor. Centralising states took over such responsibilities, though not as effectively as in the rich world. ""Philanthropy and [civilsociety] associations were sort of a minor tributary and not part of the main story of development of those nations,"" says Michael Layton of the Johnson Centre for Philanthropy at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.
They remain weak. The Latin American countries with the largest philanthropic sectors are Mexico and Colombia, according to a study published in 2018. There foundations' assets are worth 1% of annual gdp, compared with 4.8% in the United States. Ordinary folk seem less altruistic than in other regions, though the tradition of almsgiving through the church remains strong. In a global giving index put together by the Charities Aid Foundation, the only Latin American country in the top 20 is Haiti.
The region pays a high price for low levels of generosity. The population of non-profit universities, museums, birdwatching clubs and the like is sparse. Unlike in the rich world, governments do not give them much money. Worldwide, non-profits account for 5.7% of employment; in Mexico, Colombia and Peru that is 3% or less, according to Lester Salamon of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.
Latin America has too few groups that channel citizens' grievances into proposals that governments might adopt, making conflict more likely. If the rich, who are undertaxed, gave away more money, high levels of inequality might rankle less.
Recently they have become more open-handed. More than half the region's philanthropic groups have been founded since 2000, according to a study published by the Universidad del Pacífico in Peru. But the law, and increasingly politics, throw up obstacles. In many countries registering a charity is difficult. Chile has some 60 laws governing the tax treatment of donations. Donors can give tax-free money to cultural institutions but not to environmental or human-rights groups.
There is a push to change that in Chile, made more urgent by last year's violent protests against inequality and poor public services. Left- and rightleaning think-tanks are lobbying together for a law to make giving easier.
Where authoritarians rule, life is getting harder for groups that benefit from philanthropy. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's right-wing president, has made rhetorical war on defenders of the environment. Mexico's left-wing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has attacked environmental groups that oppose pet infrastructure projects, such as the Maya train across the Yucatán peninsula. This month Mexico's Senate passed a law to strip tax-exempt status from groups that get most of their income from activities not related to their charitable goals. That would hurt groups like universities that make ends meet by, for example, operating bookshops. The bill is ""a profound attack on the independence of non-profits"", says Mr Layton.
Weakening do-gooders may make life more comfortable for high-handed presidents like Messrs Bolsonaro and López Obrador. But a region traumatised by pandemic and rising poverty needs more philanthropy, not less."

ADDIS ABABA AND MEKELLE
The prime minister confronts Tigray, a restive region that will not be easy to subdue
For several days the warning lights had been flashing red. Early in the morning of October 29th a general in Ethiopia's federal army had flown to the northern region of Tigray to take up his new position as deputy commander of forces in the region. He was refused entry. In Mekelle, the regional capital, rumours swirled of troop movements across the state border in the Amhara region, as well as in Eritrea, a country to its north. Throughout Tigray young men had been armed and trained. On November 2nd its president said the region was preparing for war.
War may have begun. On November 4th Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered his forces to hit back in response to what he claimed was an ""attack"" by Tigray's ruling party on a base housing federal troops. ""The red line has been crossed,"" he said. Early reports suggest there had been a heavy exchange of artillery fire around Mekelle and on the border with Amhara. The internet and phone networks in Tigray were cut off. Abiy has declared a state of emergency in the region. In a television address he said the fighting had resulted in casualties, though he did not say how many. As The Economist went to press it was unclear whether the conflict would be limited to a brief skirmish or might blow up into a full-scale war.
The latest escalation comes after months of bitter feuding between Abiy and leaders of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (tplf), an armed group that turned into a political party after leading the rebellion that ousted the Derg, a Marxist junta, in 1991. Since then, for almost three decades, the tplf called the shots in the federal government before massive protests in 2018 among the Oromos, who make up roughly a third of Ethiopia's population, forced it to make way for Abiy.
His administration views the tplf as spoilers who are sabotaging Ethiopia's fragile transition to democracy. The tplf, by contrast, sees Abiy as a usurper determined to tear up the constitution, which guarantees self-rule for each of Ethiopia's ten ethnically based states-and even the right to secede. When the central government postponed elections earlier this year, citing covid-19, the tplf accused Abiy of scheming to extend his time in office.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the federal government and went ahead to hold its own regional election. Instead of quietly accepting the result, the central government said it was illegal. The federal parliament voted to isolate Tigray's leaders. The finance ministry in Addis Ababa stopped giving money to the regional government and set in motion plans to send funds directly to local authorities. It is also said to have blocked welfare payments to poor farmers and to have tried to prevent investors and even some tourists from travelling to Mekelle.
The tplf said that slashing federal funding amounted to a ""declaration of war"". It called for Abiy to step down and for a caretaker government to replace him. Although the prime minister had repeatedly ruled out armed intervention, parliament recently authorised it. Both sides had flexed their muscles with military shows of force. ""If Abiy wishes to fight this out, we will pay him in his coin,"" Getachew Reda, a senior tplf official, told The Economist in late October.
It is not the only conflict tugging hard at the seams of the Ethiopian state. Abiy is also waging a war against armed separatists in his own region of Oromia, the country's largest. He is struggling to quell popular protests against his rule there and elsewhere. In the past few weeks there have been several massacres, mostly of Amharas. On November 1st armed men killed dozens of women and children in a schoolyard in western Oromia, according to Amnesty International.
The federal government claims that the tplf fuels these various conflicts by arming and training opposition groups, though hard evidence has yet to be shown. This, it says, justifies action. On November 2nd Abiy's allies in Amhara called on him to finish off the tplf ""once and for all"". Parliament suggested it would declare the tplf a ""terrorist"" organisation.
Abiy may be hoping to reassert control over Tigray with a quick strike. But three factors make the conflict with the tplf especially dangerous. First, the tplf is by far the best equipped and most powerful of Ethiopia's opposition forces. Though Tigrayans are less than 10% of Ethiopia's population, the region's paramilitaries are led by veterans of both the long struggle against the Derg and of a devastating war with Eritrea fought mostly between 1998 and 2000. Tigrayan officers purged by Abiy from the federal army are said to have returned to Tigray to train and organise new recruits. Though the constitution allows each region to have its own security forces, the prime minister's office has accused the tplf of unconstitutionally ""arming and organising irregular militias"".
Moreover, Tigray is also the home base of the Ethiopian army's most powerful units, amounting to more than half its soldiers. Organised into its Northern Command, they bore the brunt of the fighting against Eritrea. The tplf reckons that many of the Northern Command's officers and soldiers would switch sides or mutiny if Abiy ordered them into battle against Tigray. On November 4th Tigray's state broadcaster claimed that many officers and other ranks had already defected. The federal government denies it.
The third factor is Eritrea. In 2018 Abiy ended the cold war between the countries by signing a peace deal with Eritrea's ageing dictator, Isaias Afwerki, for which Abiy was awarded the Nobel prize the year after. But Isaias, whose enmity with the tplf stretches back decades, has shown little appetite for peace. Instead, he has stepped up his efforts to topple his old foes by cosying up to Abiy. On October 31st Eritrea's government declared that the tplf was ""on its deathbed"". Eritrean troops are said to have been conducting provocative manoeuvres along the border. ""Tigray is preparing for war on two fronts,"" says Fetsum Berhane, a Tigrayan activist.
Both sides claim to have done all they can to prevent escalation. ""What we want is to avoid bloodshed,"" said Seyoum Mesfin, a Tigrayan who was a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, recently in Mekelle. He stressed that the tplf wanted dialogue, but with all parties on an equal footing. Abiy's office, for its part, claims the government has ""retained a policy of extreme patience"" but that war cannot be prevented by the ""goodwill"" of only one side. It insisted the army was acting to ""save the country and the region from spiralling into instability"". As both sides edge closer to war, some hear echoes of 1998. That was when Ethiopia and Eritrea sleepwalked into a catastrophic conflict. There is still just enough time for both sides to wake up. *"

KAMPALA
The Ugandan pop star who would be president
Suit torn, tie askew, eyes half-shut, Bobi Wine stood on his veranda and addressed a crowd. That morning, on November 3rd, the Ugandan pop star had handed in his nomination papers to run for president in elections in January. Moments later, police smashed the window of his car, arrested him and pepper-sprayed his face before driving him home. Bedraggled but defiant, he greeted his fans. ""This is a revolutionary election,"" he said. ""If it's a boxing fight, it has begun.""
Ugandan elections are only loosely about votes. Yoweri Museveni, the president, has ruled since fighting his way to power in 1986. He needs a contest to legitimise his regime, and uses the army, police and patronage to make sure he wins. The opposition hopes to unseat him by opening cracks in his regime. Mr Wine's struggle is part election campaign, part call to revolution. ""Running against Museveni"", he tells The Economist, ""is like running against all the institutions of state.""
For Mr Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, it has been a meteoric rise. He found fame as the ""ghetto president"", singing about social injustice. In 2017 he won a seat in parliament. Mr Museveni's acolytes were busy abolishing a presidential age limit so the old man could stand again; Mr Wine joined opposition mps in resisting the change. The bill passed, but Mr Wine channelled the energy of the campaign into a new movement, which he called ""People Power""-a messy coalition of established politicians, frustrated graduates and the hustlers of his ghetto hinterland.
People Power speaks with many voices. In the flood-prone valleys of Kampala it sounds like a revolt against the rich. On university campuses it resembles a youth rebellion. Activists in the neglected north frame it as a fight against ethnic exclusion. ""All those are just symptoms of one issue: misgovernance,"" says Mr Wine. At 38, he is half the incumbent's age.
The movement was also, at its inception, a protest against conventional politics. But in July Mr Wine announced himself the leader of an obscure party, which he renamed the National Unity Platform (nup). A party structure gave him control over candidates, a symbol on the ballot paper and a firmer legal footing. Some considered it a wrong turn. ""We are now behaving like politicians,"" says Roy Ssemboga, a former student leader, once close to Mr Wine, who is running for parliament as an independent. ""We wanted short-term glory and I think we lost an identity.""
Like other parties, the nup has become caught up in Uganda's transactional politics. The process of selecting parliamentary candidates exposed disorganisation and division. In the central region, where the 1 party is strongest, some contenders tried to buy its endorsement. Derrick Ssonko, a mechanic in blue overalls, says he was inspired to run for local councillor, but the party ticket went to a rival who paid a bribe. He worries that the nup is ""old wine in new bottles"", even though everyone he knows will vote for it.
The nup is contesting fewer than half of parliamentary seats. David Lewis Rubongoya, the party's powerful secretary-general, says that scores of contenders pulled out because of a court case that challenged its legal status (the case was dismissed, but only after nominations had closed). Many others could not muster nomination fees of 3m shillings ($800), which is the average annual income in Uganda.
But the paranoid president is not the type to take chances. He warns that Mr Wine has ""foreign backers who fear a strong Uganda"". Soldiers and police raid the nup's offices on spurious pretexts, and invoke covid-19 to block public gatherings. Activists are threatened or bought off. In 2018 Mr Wine was beaten by soldiers and charged with treason, along with 36 of his supporters (a conviction is unlikely). Voters are wary of the disorder that has always accompanied political transition. After listening to an nup activist in a northern village, 80-year-old Rose Akello raises her hand. ""Death is painful,"" she says, recalling Uganda's violent past. ""When you are pursued by a knife, don't you go and hide?""
Kizza Besigye, the main opposition leader in the past four elections, is sitting out this poll, arguing that Mr Museveni cannot be removed by voting alone. Some activists in the nup agree, but also blame Dr Besigye for demoralising voters. Their apparent strategy is to drawa massive turnout, then ""defend the vote"" on the streets. ""A vote must be cast before we can fight for it,"" says Mr Wine.
Powerful critics, such as Andrew Mwenda, a journalist who is close to the president, argue that Mr Wine's supporters are ""radical extremists"", not liberal democrats: ""They're fighting Museveni to get power and do exactly what he's doing, perhaps without his finesse.""
Others try to paint the nup as a party of Buganda, an ancient kingdom within Uganda in which Kampala lies. Buganda's kabaka (king) commands deep loyalty among the sixth of Ugandans who consider themselves his subjects, including the singer. Several leading politicians in the nup cut their teeth on royalist struggles for land and federalism. Buganda has ""legitimate and genuine concerns"", says Medard Sseggona, an nup politician and former minister in the kingdom's own cabinet, but those ""are shared by other nationalities in this country"". Mr Wine himself has cosmopolitan instincts, nurtured in the ethnic melting pot of the city.
In general, Mr Wine's politics are less revolutionary than his lyrics and red beret suggest. His headquarters are painted with murals of pan-African heroes like Thomas Sankara, a socialist leader of Burkina Faso. But he also collaborates with free-market think-tanks. ""I don't have a very radical programme,"" he says. His most consistent pledge is to rebuild institutions after decades of personalised rule.
The singer will probably never become president. Even if he dislodged Mr Museveni, any transition would be directed by the army. But the real force is not Mr Wine-it is the hope he represents. From markets to minibuses, Ugandans repeat his slogan, ""twebereremu"". What does it mean? His eyes light up. ""Get involved."" *"

DAKAR
Elections in Tanzania and Ivory Coast show African democracy is faltering
HAVE ESCAPED arrest twice today,"" said Izitto Kabwe, a Tanzanian opposition leader, on November 2nd. But, he added, ""I cannot avoid the police for ever."" The next day they picked him up, like so many of his colleagues who contested Tanzania's election on October 28th. Some have been beaten. Tundu Lissu, a leading rival to President John Magufuli, was grabbed by police in front of European embassies, where he was seeking refuge having been turned away by the American embassy. Mr Lissu was interrogated, but not charged-perhaps because German diplomats were waiting outside the police station.
Democracy in Tanzania is broken-and is in trouble elsewhere in Africa, too. Guinea's election on October 18th resulted in a dubious victory (and a third term) for President Alpha Condé. At least 30 people were killed protesting against the result, says the opposition. Ivory Coast is in crisis after President Alassane Ouattara won a third term on October 31st, amid a boycott by the opposition. Both leaders claimed not to be bound by term limits, illustrating a dismal recent trend (see map on next page).
Tanzania may be the most troubling case. Not long ago it seemed on its way to becoming a relatively prosperous democracy. For more than a decade from 2000 its economy was among Africa's best performers. But Mr Magufuli, who took over in 2015, has set things back. He has produced fishy economic numbers that seem to hide real problems, while cracking down on any opposition. In this election he won 84% of the vote, up from 58% in 2015, according to the official tally. His party won enough seats to abolish term limits, if it so chooses. The opposition is claiming fraud. ""This was not an election,"" says Mr Lissu. ""It was just a gang of people who have decided to misuse state machinery to cling to power.""
Mr Lissu has called for protests. Mr Kabwe hopes other countries will impose sanctions on Tanzania. Britain, for one, said it was ""deeply troubled"" by the result. But countries in the region have been more supine. An observer mission from the East African Community, a regional bloc, said the vote had been ""conducted in a credible manner"". The observer mission from the African Union (au) has yet to express an opinion. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, who currently chairs the au, congratulated Mr Magufuli on his win in a ""peaceful election"".
Ivory Coast seemed to be moving in the right direction, too. Mr Ouattara took over in 2011, after a disputed election and much bloodshed. The economy grew faster than most in Africa. But democracy has suffered. In 2016 Mr Ouattara wangled changes to the constitution which, he claims, reset the clock on his time in office, so that its two-term limit would not apply to him until after a fourth term. In August he reneged on his decision to retire and said he would run again. The constitutional council waved through his candidacy and blocked 40 of 44 other contenders from running, including several big names. Since then there have been protests and ethnic violence. Dozens of Ivorians have been killed.
When the time came to vote, the opposition called for civil disobedience. Protesters smashed up polling stations and prevented voting in some areas. At least five people were killed in clashes. A significant chunk of the population did not vote. The electoral commission says that 21% of polling stations never opened. The au and the Economic Community of West African States (ecowas), another regional bloc, nonetheless called the poll ""satisfactory"". Officially Mr Ouattara took 94% of the vote.
The Ivorian opposition is not backing down. Rather, it is setting up a parallel government, led by an 86-year-old, Henri Konan Bédié, who ran against Mr Ouattara in the election. Its aim is to organise a new election. Mr Ouattara's men call this sedition. Tensions are rising. On November 3rd riot police surrounded Mr Bédié's house and used tear gas to disperse journalists before carting away some 20 people, including a former minister of health. The houses of other opposition figures were also surrounded. As The Economist went to press Mr Bédié had not been arrested.
With each side taking such extreme positions, dialogue looks remote, says William Assanvo of the Institute for Security Studies in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital. He thinks the crisis will worsen, as leaders are arrested and clashes break out between rival factions and ethnic groups. Parts of the armed forces do not view Mr Ouattara as legitimate, he adds. Guillaume Soro, a former prime minister and rebel leader exiled in France, has called on the army to act against Mr Ouattara. Over 3,000 people have fled the country.
International mediation is desperately needed, says Arsene Brice Bado of the Jesuit University in Abidjan. But regional bodies tend to favour incumbents. In 2015 the members of ecowas discussed a proposal to restrict presidents in the region to two terms, but it was ultimately dropped. The limp response of ecowas to the situations in Guinea and Ivory Coast has made opposition parties even angrier.
Guinea, Tanzania and Ivory Coast are setting a bad example just as an election season in Africa heats up. Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Ghana, Niger and Uganda all go to the polls in the next few months. Their leaders might do well to look instead to the Seychelles, where last month the opposition won a presidential election for the first time since independence in 1976. The loser graciously attended his opponent's victory speech. *"

BEIRUT
Big borrowing to cope with covid-19 has not translated into big stimulus
Tourists may not have returned to Egypt's beaches and historic sites, but the portfolio investors are back. Since May foreigners have snapped up more than $10bn in local-currency debt, reversing a sell-off from the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. There is similar enthusiasm across the region. The six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council issued a record $100bn in public and corporate debt in the first ten months of the year. Treasuries are courting local investors too, though not always successfully: Tunisia's government was rebuffed when it asked the central bank to buy treasury bonds.
Arab states are on a borrowing binge. Even before covid-19 arrived many were taking on fresh debt to cope with low oil prices and sluggish economies. The pandemic has only increased their needs. By next year public-debt ratios in many of these countries will be at their highest in two decades (see chart). The region's 11 oil-and-gas-exporting countries owed an average of 25% of gdp from 2000 to 2016. Next year the imf projects that ratio will hit 47%. Increases are less stark in states without energy resources-but only because they already had high debt levels.
This is not always cause for concern. Saudi Arabia's debt-to-GDP ratio will reach an estimated 34% next year, up from 17% in 2017. Debt levels in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates will almost double as well, to 37% and 38%. These numbers are still comfortably low. All three have well-provisioned central banks or flush sovereign-wealth funds. And capital is cheap: a 35-year tranche of Saudi Eurobonds issued in January had yields below 4%.
Other oil-producing states look shakier. Bahrain's debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to hit 131% next year, up from an average of 34% from 2000 to 2016. Oman will owe 89%. Both were largely shut out of bond markets earlier this year. Oil markets offer little hope for their budgets: renewed lockdowns in Europe and rising cases in America pushed prices lower in October.
Elsewhere in the region the pandemic has reversed years of fiscal reforms. Egypt trimmed subsidies and introduced a valueadded tax after borrowing $12bn (over three years) from the imf in 2016. It cut the deficit from 11% of GDP in 2016 to 7% last year and it was on pace to lower its debt-to-GDP ratio to 79% in 2021. The pandemic, however, sent it back to the imf for a $5.2bn loan. Next year its debts are projected to climb back to 91% of GDP. Jordan will be close behind at 89%, and Tunisia at 86%.
For now, at least, investors are enthusiastic about Egyptian debt. Yields are high- the last batch of six-month treasury bills paid around 13.5%-and Abdel-Fattah alSisi's authoritarian rule has erased concerns about political instability. But sentiment can be fickle. Between March and May $12.7bn flowed out of local markets.
All this borrowing offers limited returns for Arab states. More than 70% of Kuwait's budget is earmarked for public-sector salaries and subsidies. It is taking on debt not to fund reforms but to sustain a bloated bureaucracy. Arab states have also been stingy with their covid-19 stimulus packages. They have allocated an average of 2% of GDP for pandemic-related help, compared with 3% for all emerging markets, in part because of limited fiscal firepower.
Borrowing has helped them cope, but it also exacerbates this problem (Egypt already spends an estimated 9% of GDP on debt service). Oil prices are projected to stay low next year, and vital industries such as tourism will be slow to recover. Heavier debt loads will limit the extent to which Arab governments can jolt their sluggish economies. *"

A journalist known for his scoops-and for the controversies he created
ROBERT FISK, who died in Dublin on October 30th, aged 74, was one of the most influential correspondents in the Middle East since the second world war. For the past 30-odd years he wrote mainly for the Independent, a left-of-centre British newspaper with dwindling circulation and influence at home, but his reach extended far beyond. His bitter narrative of Arab victimhood and Western wickedness (particularly American and Israeli), often brilliantly crafted, resonated across the region and was picked up in newspaper columns, by radio stations and on campuses across the world, America included. Again and again, Western correspondents in Cairo, Damascus or Baghdad would listen politely as Fisk-aficionados, from diplomats and politicians to taxi drivers and coffee-house waiters, regaled them with the wisdom of Mr Fisk's latest diatribe.
Brought up in small-town England, Mr Fisk (pictured) made his journalistic mark for the Times, covering the Troubles in Northern Ireland, where the British authorities found his reports unduly keen on the Irish republican cause; he later took up Irish citizenship, while keeping a British passport. Leading the paeans of praise on his death was Ireland's president.
Some of his scoops were world-beating. In 1982 he was among the first to enter the Palestinian refugee camps in Sabra and Shatila, where more than a thousand people had been massacred by Lebanese militias as Israeli forces looked the other way. In 1993 in Sudan, he became the first Western journalist to interview Osama bin Laden, penning an article headed: ""Anti-Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace"". ""I am a construction engineer and an agriculturalist,"" he told Mr Fisk, who pulled off two more meetings with him before the al-Qaeda leader orchestrated the killing of some 3,000 people in New York in 2001. In one session bin Laden praised ""Mr Robert"" for being ""neutral"".
Based most often in Beirut, Mr Fisk was a consummate operator who roved far and wide, from Algeria and Libya, through the Balkans and Turkey, to the homelands of Kurds and Afghans. He injected a vivid sense of history into his coverage, showing why so many people in the region felt angry and humiliated- and tended to blame the former colonial powers, and above all America and its protégés, especially Israel, for their unhappy predicament.
On one occasion, not long after the attacks of September 11th, he was roughed up by Afghan refugees in Pakistan. ""I realised"", he wrote, that their ""brutality was entirely the product of others, of us-of we who had armed their struggle against the Russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the 'War for Civilisation' just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them 'collateral damage'.""
His reputation among his peers was less rosy. He was a braggart. As we wrote in a review 15 years ago, ""Mr Fisk tries to tell the story of the Middle East, but he does not flinch from telling the story of Mr Fisk."" He was self-righteous, though most recently had been excoriated for the leniency of his attitude to Bashar alAssad, the blood-soaked Syrian dictator. He treated rumour as fact, if it suited his narrative: in 2004 he reported that the Americans had secretly spirited Saddam Hussein out of prison in Iraq to an American base in Qatar.
Correspondents from a range of worthy outlets and a diversity of ideologies have accused him of making stories up. In his mode of reporting, a tall tale, colourfully told in the supposed interests of the underdog, would often trump the literal truth."

Aung San Suu Kyi was supposed to set Burmese democracy free. Instead she has clipped its wings
The memory of Myanmar's most recent election, in 2015, still cheers Kyaw Zayya. Even if he had not been covering the results as a journalist, he would have gone to the headquarters of the National League for Democracy (nld), which swept the polls, to celebrate the end of more than 50 years of military rule. Like so many of his fellow citizens, he placed his hopes in Aung San Suu Kyi, the long-persecuted leader of the nld, who promised to bring peace, prosperity and democracy. ""We had been suffering for decades under the military regime, so we were eager to see changes,"" he says. ""I was very delighted.""
On November 8th Myanmar will vote again. This time Mr Kyaw Zayya will not be taking part. He belongs to a small but growing number of Burmese who have decided to abstain because they are bitterly disappointed with the nld. He is outraged that the commission administering the election, which is appointed by the government, has cancelled the vote in parts of the country that it says are too dangerous. In fact, not all the areas in question are plagued by violence. And the cancellation disproportionately affects ethnic minorities, many of whom are unlikely to vote for the nld. Some 1.5m voters have been disenfranchised, out of a voting-age population of roughly 35m, although the commission has reinstated polling in a few spots.
The ""no-voters"" join a swelling chorus of discontent. It includes activists and journalists hounded by the authorities, ethnic minorities brutalised by decades of violent conflict and workers left behind by rapid but uneven economic growth. Then there are the Rohingyas, a persecuted Muslim minority who have been ghettoised in squalid refugee camps on either side of Myanmar's border with Bangladesh after a series of pogroms led or cheered on by the army. The majority of Burmese still revere ""Mother Suu"" and will probably return her to power. But neither she nor the nld have proved the champions of liberal ideals that many imagined them to be. In the eyes of a growing number of Burmese, Ms Suu Kyi, having kindled the flame of democracy, is now smothering it.
The wild hopes borne aloft by Ms Suu Kyi's victory were always bound to collide with gunmetal reality. For one thing, Ms Suu Kyi presides over a system designed by the generals towards the end of their halfcentury in power, which preserves a big and inviolable role for them in government-what they call ""discipline-flourishing democracy"". The constitution gives them control over their own affairs, as well as the right to appoint the ministers of defence, the interior and borders. A quarter of the seats in the national and regional parliaments are reserved for members of the Tatmadaw, as the armed forces are known. It also controls a majority of seats on the National Defence and Security Council, which can declare an emergency. Ms Suu Kyi has no control over the Tatmadaw and, in particular, cannot force it to cease hostilities against the various ethnic insurgencies that have long racked the country.
Ms Suu Kyi naturally wants to release her government from these manacles. In March the nld put forward several constitutional amendments, among them one that would gradually reduce the number of seats in parliament reserved for military appointees. But the generals had foreseen such a move. Constitutional amendments need the support of more than three-quarters of mps. With a quarter of the seats, the Tatmadaw can block any it does not like- and so it did.
Within these restrictions, Ms Suu Kyi has tried to nibble away at the Tatmadaw's authority. She has given the previously meek anti-corruption commission some teeth and repealed a few repressive laws. She has refused to convene the security council. She has also taken the power to appoint bureaucrats in the national and local governments away from the Ministry of the Interior.
Nonetheless, the only institution capable of returning the army to the barracks is the army itself, and it will not do so until it is convinced that the civilian government is both capable of governing and committed to protecting the Tatmadaw, writes Andrew Selth of Griffith University in Australia. ""Discipline-flourishing democracy is the only game in town,"" says Ian Holliday of the University of Hong Kong.
But even in areas where Ms Suu Kyi has unfettered authority, she is no liberal. Take the nld. She runs it like the Tatmadaw ran the country: with an iron fist. ""There is no democracy in the party,"" says Thet Thet Khine. She should know: a member of the nld for seven years, she was sacked from the executive committee in 2018 for publicly criticising government policy. (She later quit the party to form one of her own, which is contesting the election.) Ms Suu Kyi does not delegate and is not cultivating a fresh crop of leaders, even though she is 75 and has no clear successor.
Ms Suu Kyi's authoritarian streak extends to the government's relations with civil society. It has repeatedly attempted to muzzle its critics in court. In 2017 two Reuters journalists, investigating violence against the Rohingyas, were sentenced to seven years in jail for breaking a colonialera national-security law. According to Athan, a local watchdog, the government has filed 251 suits against its critics, twice as many as under the previous armybacked government. The nld's spokesman, Monywa Aung Shin, points out that many of these cases were initiated by army-run ministries. Yet the nld has sued critics of Ms Suu Kyi, and could easily repeal the laws used to silence journalists and activists if it so pleased.
The government's litigiousness has had a chilling effect. The press is less free now than it was during the final years of military rule, says Zeya Thu, the editor of The Voice Journal. ""We are scared,"" says Saw Alex Htoo, an activist.
Ms Suu Kyi is also not proving the ally many minorities hoped. She spent years working with political parties that champion assorted ethnic groups as they struggled against their common enemy, the Tatmadaw. She promised to defend their rights and to broker an end to the many small wars that have raged around the periphery of the country, in areas inhabited mainly by ethnic minorities. To that end, she has held several inconclusive peace conferences.
But Ms Suu Kyi does not have ""any clear vision"" of what a less centralised, federal state might look like, argues Hla Myint of the Arakan League for Democracy (ald), which advocates for Rakhines, an ethnic group from the state of the same name (see map). During the nld's failed attempt to amend the constitution, ethnically based political parties recommended more than 3,000 changes, many of them related to devolution. The nld did not endorse a single one. And just like the military-backed government that preceded it, the nld appointed one of its own as the chief minister of Rakhine state, even though the Arakan National Party (anp), another Rakhine party, won a majority in the state election in 2015. ""We don't see any difference so far between the previous and current government when it comes to their style of governing our Rakhine state,"" says Hnin Yu She of the ald, which split from the anp in 2017.
Ethnic minorities are also upset because the peace process is flagging. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army (aa), a Rakhine guerrilla outfit, has escalated dramatically since 2019, to become the most serious conflict in the country in decades. Fighting also smoulders in Kachin and Shan states. Ms Suu Kyi is not primarily responsible, in that she cannot control the army. But she stood mutely by when it ruled out the prospect of negotiations by declaring the aa a terrorist group in March and when it excluded it from its covid-19 ceasefire. She seems not to wish to broaden her dispute with the Tatmadaw by questioning its handling of insurgencies.
In 2013, when she met Ben Rhodes, an adviser to Barack Obama, he underscored the importance of ending the country's many conflicts and evinced concern about Rohingyas. He says she replied, ""We will get to those things. But first must come constitutional reform""-for which she needs the acquiescence of the army. ""The nld's first priority"", says Mr Saw Alex Htoo, the activist, is ""to make peace with the military, not peace with the country"".
Minorities are losing faith not just in Ms Suu Kyi but in the political system itself. Aung Kaung Moe (not his real name) is a Rakhine student activist who was recently jailed for protesting against an internet blackout in the state. Your correspondent asks if he has ever considered going into politics. Yes, he says, often. But sometimes he wonders if he would not be better off throwing in his lot with the Arakan Army. Ethnic parties' success at the polls does not translate into real political power, he says: just look at how unfairly the nld treated the anp. By contrast, ethnic groups like the Wa who seize territory and successfully defend it are able to carve out autonomous enclaves. ""In Myanmar, in the reality, [ethnic armed organisations] are more powerful than the ethnic electoral political parties,"" says Mr Aung Kaung Moe. The aa, which is wildly popular among Rakhines, governs swathes of northern Rakhine state, he notes. Many young Rakhines have given up on the idea of a federal union. Now they dream of independence.
In the border regions, where most minorities live, Ms Suu Kyi has been knocked off her pedestal. In the heartland, where Bamars, the country's biggest ethnic group, predominate, support for ""Mother Suu"" is strong. But even here, cracks have begun to appear. More than twice as many Burmese surveyed by the Asian Barometer Survey (abs) last year prioritised the economy over democracy. At first glance, there is much for them to be cheerful about. Until covid-19 struck, growth had averaged 6.2% since 2015. The share of the population in poverty fell by half between 2005 and 2017. A middle class is emerging.
But growth is still slower than in the final days of the military regime (see chart). The imf reckons that the economy is underperforming by a percentage point or two, owing to weak domestic demand and sagging foreign investment. Many Burmese have yet to see the prosperity that Ms Suu Kyi promised. One in four remained poor in 2017, according to the World Bank. The precariat is growing. Nearly half of those polled by the abs last year were worried about losing their livelihood, more than twice as many as in 2015. Some 54% said they were unable to access basic services, such as water, public transport and health care, up from 48% five years ago. ""Gains from the economic reforms and growth under the nld government have yet to be widely perceived by ordinary citizens,"" the authors of the survey wrote.
Part of the problem is the government's lack of capacity. When the nld took up residence in Naypyidaw, the army-built capital, Ms Suu Kyi stuffed the cabinet full of the party faithful-men (and they are all men) whose only qualification was their loyalty to her. Their ineptitude, combined with an inert bureaucracy staffed by ex-soldiers, left the government floundering and unable to achieve anything much.
Matters have improved somewhat as incompetent ministers have been replaced with technocrats. Yet the government still has few tools to help the poor, according to Gerard McCarthy of the National University of Singapore. It ""inherited a really skeletal social safety net"", he says, and its capacity to improve matters is limited. Tax revenue has hovered at around 7% of gdp since 2016, less than half the average in South-East Asia. Myanmar's covid-19 stimulus amounted to a miserly 3.4% of gdp, also far below the regional average.
The nld discourages the poor from relying on the state, argues Mr McCarthy. For decades it has cleaved to the idea that people are morally obliged to help themselves and others through acts of charity, an ethic born of both Buddhism and necessity. During the austere years of army rule, political organisations were outlawed and there was no public safety net. People in need could turn only to charities. But this ideology is in growing conflict with the expectations of the public, a majority of whom believe that democracy should lead to better public services, according to the abs.
Just five years after civilians took power, Burmese have muddled and ambivalent views about their hard-won political freedoms. Although 87% of those surveyed by abs say that they support democracy, twothirds believe it does not effectively promote economic growth or maintain order. People also harbour wistful thoughts about military rule. Nearly half support a role for the Tatmadaw in politics-up from 39% in 2015. Confusingly, 56% also back military rule, compared with 48% five years ago.
Younger, rural Bamars who care about the economy and security are more likely to admire the men in uniform. They are less likely ""to remember the really bad times,"" notes Bridget Welsh, one of the authors of the abs report. What they do remember is that Thein Sein, an ex-general who began the process of opening up the country, was a better steward of the economy than Ms Suu Kyi. These Burmese believe that Muslims pose an existential threat to the country's survival, and that the army is necessary to repel them and keep order in a fractious nation, says Mr Holliday. The surveys he conducted with Roman David, of Lingnan University in Hong Kong, suggest that a growing minority of the Burmese population do not see democracy and army rule as antithetical to each other, but as systems of governance that can co-exist. Ms Suu Kyi, in other words, is undermining her own legacy. *"

SEOUL
At home, K-pop plays second fiddle to a fustier, more sentimental genre
AT A CINEMA in Seoul eight middle-aged women in matching sky-blue hoodies, hair bands and face masks are sharing dried figs and persimmons as they chat and snap selfies. They have travelled from all over the country for the opening weekend of ""Mr Trot"", a film based on a South Korean television show that aired earlier this year. In the show, a mix of washed-up and aspiring male crooners chosen from 15,000 applicants dress up in pastel suits and semiunbuttoned silk shirts and sing old South Korean ballads to compete for the title of ""Mr Trot"". The women, whose hoodies read ""Lim Young-woong, you are my hero"", are members of an online fan club for the winner. They are not alone in their obsession: more than 30% of South Korean televisionviewers tuned into the show's final episode in March.
Trot, which emerged in the early 20th century when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony, blends traditional Korean music with elements of the Japanese and Western popular songs of the era. It has long been ubiquitous in South Korea, but it has been a long time since it was considered cool-if it ever was. The ballads, with their cheesy melodies, melodramatic lyrics and repetitive beats are perennial favourites with drunken revellers in noraebang, or ""singing rooms"", the South Korean equivalent of karaoke parlours. Songs about doomed romance, lost hometowns and the general tragedy of life blare from speakers at motorway service stations and from the radios of buses and taxis driven by older men. The more up-tempo numbers are beloved of political parties at election time, when candidates and activists regale voters with clunky dancing set to trot blasting from campaign lorries.
But partly thanks to the popularity of ""Mr Trot"" and its predecessor ""Miss Trot"", a similarly popular programme with female contestants that aired last year, the genre has gone from a sentimental throwback to a potent cultural force. The shows' stars have become celebrities. In 2019 two of the three most popular music acts in South Korea were trot singers, eclipsed only by bts, the world's biggest boy band. Trot singers top the charts for streaming and record sales. Several new trot-themed television shows are trying to emulate the success of their famous predecessors. Companies selling everything from coffee to gas boilers have recruited trot stars to front tising campaigns.
The trot renaissance owes a lot to South Korea's other big musical genre, K-pop, as well as to covid-19. At the cinema in Seoul, the blue-hooded women explain that in running their fan club, they have been inspired by devotees of K-pop, who are notable not just for their ardour, but for their organisation. ""We co-ordinate on social media to vote for our favourite candidates and stream their songs every day to make sure they make the charts,"" says the 50something woman with long hair and big glasses who has organised the outing and who became a trot fan while bored at home during the early days of the pandemic. Members' age ranges from 40 to over 80. ""If someone older doesn't know how to do the right thing on their phone, we teach them."" This sort of activism is new for the middleaged people who tend to listen to trot, says Son Min-jung of Korea National University of Education, who studies the history and cultural significance of the genre. ""They used to be passive listeners-trot has always been popular, but now it's visible,"" she says.
And even though trot fans are much older than K-pop groupies, they are no more level-headed or dispassionate. The cinema in Seoul is full of middle-aged women who alternatively whoop and weep as their hero and his fellow contestants sing, dance and change into a dazzling array of costumes for two and a half plodding hours. Their only complaint is that ""there could have been more about them hanging out together, just like brothers-because it's not just about one of them winning, but all of them together."" That remark, too, could have come straight from a hardened BTS fan. *"

UNTIL THIS week, Asia's most famous ministerial tattoo belonged to the Indonesian former fisheries minister, Susi Pudjiastuti. But you had to know where to look-the birdlike form lived on Ms Susi's shin. In contrast, New Zealand's new foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, sports a Maori tattoo known as a moko kauae on her lips and chin.
Ms Mahuta is part of the most diverse cabinet in New Zealand's history, appointed by Jacinda Ardern following a thumping re-election for the prime minister and the Labour Party she leads. Ethnically, almost half the 20 members are not pakeha, ie, white, including five indigenous Maori. There are eight women, two of whom are lesbians with young children, and the first openly gay deputy prime minister, Grant Robertson.
Ms Ardern would not, this week, have fared well in Kansas. After a massacre of Muslim worshippers last year, she swiftly implemented a ban on semi-automatic weapons. Climate change and the environment are big priorities. She likes to talk about her ""team of 5m"", meaning all Kiwis. Vogue magazine nicknamed her the ""anti-Trump"".
Yet the prime minister's liberal stances are not so much shaping the country's attitudes as emblematic of them. New Zealand, after all, was the first place in the world to give women the vote. The country is content, even occasionally smug, about being so very progressive. As Andrew Geddis of the University of Otago says of Ms Mahuta's moko kauae, New Zealand's public face ""says something about how we're changing as a society and what we're comfortable with showing the world"".
More notable than the appearance of Ms Ardern's cabinet is how voters answered one question on their ballot paper: should New Zealand legalise assisted dying for those with a terminal illness? Though the final tally has yet to be announced, around two-thirds of New Zealanders appear to have said ""yes"".
Dying with dignity has been the subject of heated debate for years. Voluntary euthanasia has had the support of libertarians, notably David Seymour, who heads the act party, as much as of more leftleaning types. In 2015 Lecretia Seales, a lawyer with a terminal brain tumour, sued the government for the right to die. She lost, but after her death her husband redoubled the campaign. A national debate ensued, in which lawmakers looked to see what worked in other countries.
Last year Parliament passed the End of Life Choice Act. It restricts access to assisted dying more than some European legislation. It requires you to be suffering from a terminal illness that is likely to end your life within six months, to be showing a significant decline in physical capability and to be able to make an informed decision. Arguments that the law would result in disabled people, the mentally ill or even children being put to death never gained traction. The law's enactment was contingent on the referendum, which was binding. New Zealand thus becomes only the seventh country to legalise assisted dying, and the first country in Asia- though the Australian state of Victoria passed a similar law last year.
Yet when it came to another, nonbinding, question on their ballots, about whether to legalise cannabis, Kiwis curiously found limits to their openmindedness: just over half appear to have voted against the proposition. That might seem strange. New Zealand is one of the easiest places in the world to get a toke, and Ms Ardern's admission of having smoked weed elicited little more than a national shrug. More than half of those aged between 15 and 45 say they've done the same.
Still, as Lara Greaves of the University of Auckland, puts it, full legalisation of cannabis, rather than its simple decriminalisation, was ""a jump too far"". Some feared that making more available would only further encourage its use, especially among the young. Moreover, said anticannabis campaigners, a problem already exists with heavy alcohol consumption, especially among Maori and Pacific-islanders-why add to it? Besides, who is going to get locked up just for smoking a joint?
Such arguments are understandable. But they miss a point that Maori community workers and others make: Maori are far more likely than pakeha to be charged with possession and cultivation of marijuana. And the disproportionate number of Maori banged up for small-fry drug offences feeds into the pathology of Maori gangs that blight indigenous life. Even the most progressive societies have their blind spots."

FENGYANG
China's new ""dual-circulation"" strategy means relying less on foreigners
At the headquarters of Deli, one of China's biggest makers of glassware, display shelves hold hundreds of drinking glasses of all shapes, sizes and colours. Some are stubby. Others are impossibly thin wine goblets, marketed as having a ""feminine body curve"". But it is another curve-the steep upward one that Deli's mastery of the business has traced-that ought to command more attention. Founded in 1996, the company initially churned out cheap, easily chipped glasses. Little by little it has raised its game, nearly tripling its exports over the past decade. It once had no choice but to import equipment for crafting its finest glassware. Now it can use China-made machinery. ""Apart from branding, there's not much that separates us from the world's best,"" says Cheng Yingling, a senior executive.
Deli's evolution-which has involved getting better and more Chinese at the same time-is what the government wants for the broader economy. These are not exactly novel ideas. For years officials have declared that China must grow more innovative and more resilient. To a certain extent it has achieved this naturally, as a result of its fast-paced economic development. But these goals have taken on far greater urgency as tensions with America have mounted. American restrictions on exports of critical components, notably semiconductors, have shone a harsh light on the gaps in China's industrial abilities. Drinking glasses may be much simpler to make-requiring not much more than sand and sodium carbonate plus some relatively basic machinery-but China is not about to stop there. Xi Jinping, China's leader, has described the creation of fully domestic supply chains as a matter of national security.
The question is how to build them. Chinese officials know that they cannot turn their backs on the world. Exports are still an important source of revenue for many firms such as Deli. And China must attract technology and investment from abroad. Pushing too transparently for ""indigenous innovation"", a term once bandied about by the government, only makes foreigners wary. Striking the right balance is tough.
Enter the newest of China's big economic policies: the ""dual-circulation"" strategy. At its most basic it refers to keeping China open to the world (the ""great international circulation""), while reinforcing its own market (the ""great domestic circulation""). If that sounds rather vague, it is: the government has not spelled out the details. Nevertheless, it has fast emerged as the most talked-about economic policy in China, with analysts and businesspeople jostling to put their spin on it. The strategy lies at the heart of the five-year plan for 2021-25, an outline of which was released by the Communist Party on November 3rd. Its implementation-especially how China resolves the tension between the two kinds of circulation-will be critical to the way that China's economy develops.
The term ""international circulation"" was coined in 1988 by Wang Jian, a government researcher who argued that China should pursue an export-led growth strategy, plugging its vast pool of cheap labour into global production networks. Well into the early 2000s, this was a guiding principle for China's economic planners. Yet cir- cumstances have changed. Exports have shrunk as a share of gdp-from 36% in 2006 to 18% last year. The government has repeatedly vowed to make consumption within China a bigger engine of growth. So scholars have been turning their attention more to the domestic kind of circulation.
In May it became evident that this academic debate had reached official ears. At a meeting of the Politburo, Mr Xi described dual circulation as the framework for economic policy. Initially, jaded veterans of Chinese official rhetoric were tempted to dismiss this as just another way of phrasing the long-stated goal of rebalancing towards domestic demand. But it has become clear that something bigger is afoot. More recent comments by Mr Xi on the economy have been less about promoting consumption and more about bolstering China's defences. China needs ""self-developed, controllable"" supply chains, with at least one alternative source for vital products, he said in a speech published on October 31st. Even more striking was his inversion of the idea of international circulation. Instead of talking about it in terms of the economic benefits China reaps from globalisation, he emphasised only the strategic purpose of opening China's doors to foreign firms, ie that making them more dependent on the Chinese market would deter foreign powers from putting pressure on the country.
That combination-the pursuit both of economic self-reliance and of greater economic leverage over foreign countries- now describes much of what China is doing. Mr Xi refers to changes ""unseen in a hundred years"" sweeping the global order-a way of saying that, while China is rising, America is declining and trying to stop the new power (see Chaguan). ""Where linkages with the global economy create vulnerabilities, China wants to minimise them,"" says Andrew Polk of Trivium China, a research firm. ""Where the linkages create benefits, China wants to expand them.""
Chinese officials tailor their remarks on dual circulation to please foreign ears. In a video address on November 4th at the opening of the China International Import Expo, an annual jamboree in Shanghai, Mr Xi said the concept would involve opening China more widely to the rest of the world. ""This is not just what China needs for its development, but something that will enrich the people of all countries,"" he said. But businesses in China see the concept more as an indication that the government will step up support for favoured industries at home, says Zhu Ning of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. They are hungry for news of handouts.
In its outline of the new five-year plan (a fleshed-out final version will be adopted next year at the annual session of China's parliament, probably in March), the party did not specify industries to be coddled. Instead it referred more generally to a need to develop critical technologies at home. But other policies already in train suggest that China will prop up any high-tech sector threatened by global vicissitudes. In August it announced tax breaks and loan support for semiconductor and software firms. China currently produces about 30% of the chips it consumes (see chart 1). Its goal is to reach 70% by 2025. Another focus is on green technology and renewable energy. That is not just for the sake of the environment (China recently pledged to halt the rise of its carbon emissions by 2030). Investment in such businesses will also limit China's thirst for imported oil.
In the past, when publishing outlines of five-year plans prior to their adoption by parliament, the party has often announced a goal for average annual gdp growth during the plan period (see chart 2). There was no such figure this time. In separate comments, Mr Xi said it was entirely possible that China could double the size of its economy by 2035. That would require average annual growth of 4.7% over the next 15 years. Such a rate would be readily attainable for the first half of that period, but may become much harder thereafter.
China has good reason to abandon such targets. They lead to an overemphasis on investment in infrastructure and other short-term measures to boost growth, rather than on social policies such as those relating to health care or education which can promote growth but may take longer to show results. But de-emphasising targets may relate to the new dual-circulation strategy in a way that the government has left unspoken. Making the economy less reliant on global supply chains could crimp its ability to grow.
Arguably China has been the world's main beneficiary of globalisation, which has enabled it to dominate ever-bigger segments of manufacturing. Turning inward could be costly. It may result in less foreign technology flowing into China, less of the competition that has spurred on Chinese firms, and more wasteful investment as the government throws money at favoured industries. Shaun Roache, an economist with s&p, a credit-rating agency, forecasts that China's average annual growth will be 4.6% in the 2020s. But he reckons it could be about 3% if the drive for self-reliance is overdone. The country's ""tolerance for slower growth may well be tested in the years ahead"", he says. The party, ever fearful that a stagnating economy could trigger social unrest, may find it hard going.
Optimism is a stubborn trait, so some inveterate China-bulls think that emphasising domestic circulation may create a new wave of reforms aimed at making the country's markets function more efficiently. Take the semiconductor industry. Caixin, a Chinese financial magazine, reported last month that Huawei, a tech giant, was rushing to create a ""not-madein-America"" supply chain by 2022. Initially, however, that would enable it to make chips with transistors spaced 28 nanometres (billionths of a metre) apart, far less dense than the most advanced ones. The bullish case is that China, realising how long it will take to catch up in such areas, will try to boost productivity by cracking on with hitherto slow-moving reforms. Analysts with Huatai Securities, a brokerage, think that could include doing more to loosen the household-registration system known as hukou, which impedes the movement of rural labour to the country's biggest and most productive cities.
In the meantime, companies are getting on with their work. Mr Cheng at Deli, the glassware firm, says he will not give up on foreign markets despite the pandemic's impact on demand. But he will mainly focus on brighter prospects at home. His team is refining their product range for younger consumers, who are pickier about style and more demanding about quality than their parents. That mix of emphasis, your correspondent ventures, sounds a lot like a corporate version of the dual-circulation strategy. ""We're not too clear about what all that means,"" he says with a sigh. ""We're just following the market."" *"

Shortly before election day in America, Chaguan spent an instructive morning in central Beijing listening to a senior Chinese official explain why his country does not care who sits in the White House. This was partly bravado, for China's rulers do not care to play up the idea that mere voters might hold world leaders to account. But the official's disdain also reflects an elite consensus that a full reset of us-China relations is difficult to imagine.
China wants smoother ties with America, said the official. But given their deep roots, present-day tensions will be hard to reverse unless America comes to a new understanding of the world. Westerners are a self-centred and judgmental lot, he charged. They never expected the Chinese-a diligent, studious people-to rival them so soon. No matter which party runs Washington, the official said, ""The us has to answer this question: can the us or the Western world accept or respect the rise of China?""
To Chinese leaders, Donald Trump's aggression in office merely accelerated some inevitable trends. To them, the Trump era shows that talk of values is a sham, that China alarms Americans because it is getting stronger-and that the solution is to become more powerful, until Western critics are shamed into silence by China's success. They also think that American weakness is making that ex-hegemon (even more) vicious and determined to scapegoat China. Back when Xi Jinping was China's vice-president, he spent many hours with his counterpart Joe Biden, who is seen as an establishment centrist close to business sectors that want better China ties. But struggle with America is seen as unavoidable.
Ordinary Chinese citizens never followed an American election so closely. But many watched with more scorn than envy. Instead, abetted by censors who allowed mocking jokes and memes about the race to flood social media, a common view is that the result is irrelevant. The Chinese internet is full of posts backing Mr Trump. Most reflect glee over his pugnacious style and a hunch that his incompetence, notably in handling covid-19, has usefully harmed America. Other fans include nationalists grateful for Mr Trump's reluctance to condemn official abuses in places like Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as, confusingly, dissidents and Hong Kongers who think him tough on the Communist Party.
Americans may object that Chinese views of their politics are cartoonish, incoherent and self-serving. But cynicism about the democratic West-among both elites and the general public-matters. For it helps to explain how the party will approach what its Central Committee described on October 29th as a ""profound adjustment in the international balance of power"".
Elite cynicism about America preoccupies Chairman Rabbit, a Harvard-educated Chinese blogger whose 1.7m followers on Weibo, a social-media platform, include business leaders and officials in government ministries. Ren Yi, the chairman's real name, is a mainstream nationalist with princeling blood: his grandfather was a reformist party secretary of Guangdong province in the 1980s. His posts explore the nuances of American politics. But the wider public associates such nuance with naivety. Mr Trump was liked in China until 2018, says Mr Ren over coffee in a Beijing hotel. His populist nationalism resonated, as did his praise for President Xi. His slogan ""Make America Great Again"" mirrored talk of a great Chinese rejuvenation. Even the trade war had fans, at first. When Mr Trump's envoys pushed China to speed up market-opening reforms, some influential Chinese were sympathetic to American arguments, recalls Mr Ren. Three events changed the mood. Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a boss at Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, on behalf of American prosecutors investigating alleged sanctions-busting. Then American politicians cheered on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Finally came America's bungling of the pandemic, even as the Chinese public complied with strict health controls that tamed the virus at home.
Mr Ren saw friends concluding that all American politicians are as bad as each other. Most Chinese ""think of us politics as a huge conspiracy to keep China down"", a suspicion that they flaunt as a badge of sophistication, says the blogger. Where once the Chinese romanticised America as an advanced nation, ""Now because of covid they see the us people as selfish, anti-science, anti-intellectual."" It is no accident that events that angered Chinese-Ms Meng's arrest and the protests in Hong Kong-touched on sovereignty. Homogeneous China finds it hard to comprehend pluralistic, divided America, says Mr Ren. What Chinese really care about is China's strength and territorial integrity. ""They think that it is China's destiny to rise, and so to come into conflict with America.""
Too late to contain China, still time to compete
Popular opinion concerns Wang Yong, who directs the Centre for American Studies at Peking University, one of China's most prestigious institutions. A frequent guest on state media, he made a series of short election-eve videos about America for Jinri Toutiao, an online platform, racking up over 10m visits. As he describes it, America's China policies are guided by competing interest groups, with Mr Biden heeding the Wall Street financiers and Silicon Valley bosses who seek ""more rational"" ties with China, while hawks and ""deep-state forces"" push for a new cold war. China and America can work together on such shared interests as climate change, public health and enabling global prosperity, he insists. Yet people should be realistic, says the professor over jasmine tea near his university. America ""has been accustomed to the top position in world affairs and will use all means to defend its status"".
Amid such distrust, any Chinese rapprochement with America should be understood for what it is: a bid to buy time while China races to become stronger. China's rulers are not hiding their worldview, which is based on the idea that only the powerful are treated with respect. America can choose whether or not to compete. But it has been warned: American gridlock would be a win for China. *"

KABUL
Even as traditional globalisation has slowed, a new kind has picked up pace
Hairport, a barber shop, could be anywhere in the world. A smart logo on its doors shows a pirate in a tricorn, flanked by crossbone-style scissors. Giant photos of tattooed and bearded hipsters cover its walls. Two stylists trim the beards of jeans-clad customers. The owner, Ahmed Zia, a 31-year-old who founded the place in 2018, explains the logo, which he designed himself. ""I was a fan of 'Pirates of the Caribbean',"" he says, ""I like the idea of a team of pirates."" Hence the crossbonesstyle theme. He settled on the name because it sounds like ""airport""-a portal to the rest of the world.
What makes Hairport striking is its location: in Kabul, the embattled capital of Afghanistan. The city is no stranger to beards. A couple of decades ago, sporting them was compulsory, a rule enforced with beatings by the Taliban. But in the past few were so well maintained, nor were they accompanied by tattoos or earrings.
Today, however, Hairport is one of many such barber shops to have opened in Kabul. Walk around Shahr-e-Naw, a neighbourhood in the city's centre, and you stumble across half a dozen, with names like ""New York barber"" or ""West Style barber"". Some offer tattoos, too. ""The market has completely changed,"" says Mr Zia, who sports carefully clipped facial topiary. ""The youth now are very interested in new styles."" They get their ideas from Instagram and Pinterest, he says, and happily pay 200 Afghanis ($2.60) for a trim. As for skin ink? ""It is prohibited in our religion,"" he says, ""but the youngsters, they do not care.""
Globalisation in the traditional sense has slowed in the past couple of decades. Even before covid-19 smashed it, global trade had stagnated for a decade. By last year, foreign direct investment (fdi) as a share of gdp had fallen by two-thirds compared with its peak in 2007. The globalisation of brands, which once seemed unstoppable, has slowed. From the 1970s to the early 2000s, the number of countries in which you could get a McDonald's soared, from just two to over 100. But no new country has welcomed the firm in over four years. Indeed a few places, such as Bolivia and Iceland, have demolished their golden arches. Big expansions of other brands have failed. In January Walmart, an American retailer, began laying off people in India and wrapping up its business there.
And yet in recent years a different type of globalisation has accelerated. A new design aesthetic is taking over the world, spread not via brands or fdi, but through social media and the internet. Even as formal trade slows, the globalisation of taste is rampant. Starbucks may not have reached large chunks of the world, but there are very few large cities in the world now in which a visitor cannot order a latte surrounded by exposed wood and vintage light bulbs. Kabul boasts no McDonald's, but you can get a decent burger and fries at Burger House, a restaurant that would not be out of place in San Francisco.
A global ""hipster index"" drawn up by MoveHub, an international shipping company, in February, did not include Kabul in its calculations of the world's 446 most latte-soaked metropolises. The firm ranked cities by the number of coffee shops, record stores, tattoo parlours, vegan restaurants and vintage boutiques. At the top were predictable spots such as Brighton, in England, and Portland, Oregon, on the west coast of America. But the hipsters have spread much farther afield.
At the Lion Café in West Kabul, young trendies slurp coffee beneath paintings by local artists. ""Sometimes you need a break from your own culture,"" says Karim Karimi, a 22-year-old law student, who takes his laptop there to work. ""It is joyful when you can find that in your own country,"" he says. Even Goma, a city in conflict-ridden eastern Congo, boasts Le Petit Chalet, which serves quinoa protein bowls as well as ""latte macchiatos"". In Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, a place at least as war-torn as eastern Congo, Le Grand Café features exposed brickwork (the café does still rely on freeze-dried Nescafé; global gentrification has its limits).
How did the hipster burn his tongue?
The style, all ""raw wood tables, exposed brick, and hanging Edison bulbs"", has been termed ""AirSpace"" by Kyle Chayka, an American writer. Sajith Pai, a venture capitalist in Delhi, describes it as ""the bastard child of ikea, Starbucks and Apple"". Its purpose is to communicate to potential customers that there will be a certain level of quality; that the coffee or haircut will meet some global standard. ""You can call it reassurance design,"" he says.
Wealthier Indians decorate their own homes with ""slightly old furniture, hand looms, that sort of thing"", not spartan brick and stripped-down wood, says Mr Pai. But they seek out hipster design in the bars and cafés of places such as Delhi and Mumbai because it signals their membership of a global elite. Mr Pai reckons the biggest consumers of this style are not the super-rich but the class just beneath them-the upper-middle class, who cannot stretch to Bentleys or private jets, but can afford plane tickets and posh coffees.
Both the rich and middle class are growing in numbers. According to the World Bank, the share of the world's population living on more than $10 per day (at 20iipurchasing-power parity)-enough money to buy things other than food and shelter- has swelled from less than a quarter two decades ago to almost two-fifths in 2017. The bulk of the growth has been in East Asia, but the figure increased in every region (see chart). The Brookings Institution, a think-tank, estimated in 2018 that the number of rich people (those living on more than $110 a day) will grow by 50%, or 100m people, by 2030. The global middle class (which it also defines as those on more than $10 a day) will increase to almost two-thirds of the world's population.
Such people are more likely than they were to be urbanites. Over half the world's population now live in cities, according to the World Bank. Not everyone in poorworld cities (or even those in rich ones) will be able to afford regular flat whites or visits to craft-beer bars. But cities create highpaying specialist jobs, so some will. That allows specialist tastes to flourish. In Kenya, Eoin Flinn, the Irish ceo of 254 Brewing, a craft-beer company (named after Kenya's dialling code), says that his firm has experimented with beers from a ""Mexican pineapple sour"" to a ""Nitro Stout"". The buyers are middle-class Kenyans bored with of the bog-standard lagers that were until recently the only option.
This class of people is more global literally, too. There are 272m migrants worldwide, according to the International Organisation for Migration (iom), a un body. That figure represents just 3.5% of the world's population. But it is at an all-time high. And it is already higher than the iom's predictions for 2050 made in 2003. Some are refugees. Many more-nearly twothirds-are economic migrants.
Both groups contribute to the globalisation of hipsterism. While abroad they acquire new tastes and money which they then bring home. In Afghanistan many of the hottest new businesses, such as the Lion Café, are founded by Afghans who previously fled their country. The same is true in Somalia-a country with a population of 15m, but a diaspora of 2m. Mogadishu is not an easy place to get a posh coffee-but it is now possible, thanks to Somali returnees.
With travel comes education and thus exposure to a global culture of trendiness. Between 1975 and 2017 the number of students studying outside their home country increased from 800,000 to almost 5m. Their ranks have swelled even faster this millennium-the figure increased by a fifth between 2012 and 2016 alone.
But it is not just travelling abroad for education that has increased. Global education options at home have, too. The American University of Afghanistan, inspired by the American University of Beirut, was established in Kabul in 2004. Its professors include foreigners and Afghans educated abroad. Courses are taught in English, not Dari or Pushtu, Afghanistan's two predominant languages.
Yet the biggest driver of late has surely been the internet. It enables would-be trendsetters to access information about the latest fashions free of charge, at least those who can read English and afford mobile-phone data. Worldwide, the proportion of people with a broadband subscription has nearly doubled since 2010. In only a few countries, such as Eritrea and North Korea, is fast mobile internet not widely available in big cities. Restaurant designers and hair stylists from Kabul to Bangui can take inspiration from Instagram; so can their consumers. In Afghanistan a fastgrowing sector is e-commerce, mostly of Chinese ""drop-shipped"" goods, which retailers order straight from the factory and sell via Facebook. Where commerce spreads, so does culture.
What does the rise of this class mean? A class of people who buy into a common cult of mid-century furniture and banal contemporary art do not always endear themselves to their fellow citizens. Even in rich countries, they cluster in cities which tend to vote for left or liberal-leaning parties. And even in those places-where they are accused of ""gentrification"" or worse- they are not always welcome. The rise of such a style hints at an urban-rural divide that is growing all over the world.
He drank his cortado before it was cool
Yet in rich countries these days being a hipster is hardly a rebellion-the culture has spread so relentlessly in big cities it is practically conformist. A somewhat tongue-incheek mathematics study published last year by Brandeis University found that even ""pure anti-conformist[s] systematically taking their decisions with a tendency to oppose the majority"" can end up making the same decisions as everybody else. These days it would be far braver for an entrepreneur in New York or Copenhagen to start a business with plastic tables and staff sporting chinos and polo-shirts.
That is not true in many poor countries, and especially not in Kabul, where universities and schools are frequent targets of attack, most recently on November 2nd. At Hairport, the barber shop in Kabul, Mr Zia says that the Taliban returning to power is his greatest fear. Before getting into his own business, he studied English in Pakistan and then worked with the American army. He likes the idea of the rest of the world. But he says, ""I love my country,"" and does not want to leave. Afghanistan's future is uncertain. If the Taliban come back, ""I am planning to run away."" Not everyone with a beard is a good omen. *"

NEW YORK
Look beyond the frothy stockmarket and booming tech giants and you will find that much of American business is still in a sorry state
On the hustings, both Donald Trump and Joe Biden promised to revive America's economy from its pandemicinduced funk. Doing so will require a turnaround for corporate America, which has suffered a savage downturn. When the occupant of the White House starts his four year term in January, in what state will American business be?
Some recent vital signs may look promising. America's economy expanded at a record pace of 33%, on an annualised basis, in the third quarter. Total profits for the big firms of the s&p 500 index have surpassed analysts' expectations by roughly a fifth, with 85% beating forecasts for the quarter. Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley, a bank, calculates that revenues for the median s&p 500 firm rose by 1% year on year. Small wonder that the Conference Board, a research organisation, published a survey on October 20th finding that its measure of confidence of bosses at big companies has jumped to 64 from 45 in the previous quarter-a figure above 50 indicates more positive than negative responses.
Yet anyone tuning into big firms' quarterly update calls with Wall Street investors could not help but pick up the tentative tone and frequent dour notes of executives. Visa, a payments company, for example, called the recovery ""uneven"". Caterpillar, a maker of industrial machinery, admitted it is ""holding more inventory than we normally would"" because of the uncertainties resulting from the pandemic. And a close analysis of the figures suggests that the corporate recovery is very patchy, with some industries and smaller firms still in big trouble. Meanwhile, corporate balancesheets are under strain, which could hold back investment and lead to an eventual rise in defaults.
America's economic boom in the latest quarter would be impressive had it not come on the heels of a comparable decline in gdp in the previous three-month period. The economy remains 3.5% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, reckons the Conference Board, and it is not likely to return to its pre-pandemic level until the tail end of 2021 or possibly later (see chart on next page). As for the large proportion of companies where profits exceeded expectations this quarter, Tobias Levkovich of Citi, a bank, is unimpressed: ""Beating lowered earnings expectations is not that great a feat."" It is now clear that analysts were too pessimistic when they pencilled in their forecasts earlier in the year. He adds that many firms managed to improve profits not by boosting sales but by slashing their expenses. The business outlook remains ""squishy"", he reckons, as ""you can't costcut your way to prosperity.""
The more you peer into the numbers, the more inconsistent the recovery looks. One source of differentiation is where a company's customers are based. Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, another bank, estimates that the companies in the s&p 500 reported an aggregate revenue decline of 2.8% and a fall of 10.2% in profits in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. But he estimates that at American firms focused on exports profits plunged by over 14%, whereas those companies more reliant on the domestic market suffered a drop of less than 9%.
Size is another lens which reveals the uneven recovery. Binky Chadha of Deutsche Bank argues that it is ""a tale of two stockmarkets"". The market capitalisation of the five biggest tech giants (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet) has fallen in recent weeks from its peak of roughly a quarter of the entire value of the s&p 500 index. Even so, they have generated returns of 39% for shareholders this year and without them the 495 others have produced a return of -1%.
Small and medium-sized firms (smes) have been crushed. The proportion of them that are making losses-based on the Russell 2000, an index of SMEs-has declined a bit from its peak of above 40%, but it remains well above 30%. smes are nearly four times as likely to be losing money as big firms, a far worse situation than during the recession of 2001or the global financial crisis a decade ago.
The mood in the board rooms of small companies is foul. The latest survey of executives at smes, published by the Wall Street Journal and Vistage, an executivecoaching organisation, found sentiment ""stalled in October 2020 due to increased concerns about an economic slowdown amid a resurgence in covid-19 infections."" The gloomy outlook, the most pessimistic in six years, may be explained by the fact that 42% of small firms believe they will run out of cash in under six months.
If the inconsistency of the recovery is one worry, the other is the state of firms' balance-sheets. Corporate debt was rising before the pandemic, and many firms have piled on more borrowings in order to cover the shortfall in revenue they have experienced this year. Edward Altman of nyu Stern School of Business is worried about what he calls ""the enormous build-up of non-financial corporate debt."" By his estimation, firms have issued more than $360bn in high-yield debt (ie, junk bonds) so far this year, surpassing the previous record of $345bn in all of 2012. With debtearnings ratios reaching critical levels, and a resurgence in corporate defaults, Mr Altman reckons that 6.5% to 7% of junk bonds, by dollar value, will default in 2020.
His fears are echoed by s&p Global, a credit-rating agency. It calculates that the ""distress ratio"" (distressed credits are junk bonds with spreads of more than ten percentage points relative to us Treasuries) for American companies had come down to 9.5% in September from its peak of 36% in March but that it remains above pre-pandemic levels. Corporate America already leads the world in the tally of corporate defaults this year, with 127 by the end of October. Nicole Serino of s&p Global notes that corporate credit quality is deteriorating, with the number of firms rated a lowly CCC+ or below now 50% higher than at the end of 2019. For such firms, she worries that ""excess liquidity and low interest rates are only postponing the inevitable.""
With a large share of firms still making losses and given the weakening of balancesheets it is far from clear that American business is in the clear. What happens next depends on three unknowns. One is the fallout from this week's presidential vote. A prolonged period of post-election uncertainty would weigh on the mood, notes Mr Levkovich. He points to the 11% fall in the s&p 500 index after the election in 2000 while legal wrangling decided the outcome of the contest for the presidency between George W. Bush and Al Gore.
Another unknown is the timing and size of the next package of fiscal stimulus from Congress, which at the moment is frozen by partisan gridlock in Washington, dc, and which could be limited if the Republicans keep firm control of the Senate. This matters to companies because, as Mr Golub puts it, ""the government has effectively said, 'We do not want market forces to drive firms out of business right now and so we are going to backstop a large part of the economy.' "" Mr Wilson believes that the number of companies going bankrupt so far this year has been much lower than otherwise feared because of generous stimulus measures.
The biggest unknown, though, is the pandemic. Moody's, a credit-rating agency, predicts that corporate-debt defaults will continue to rise until March 2021. The reason it gives is ""economic recovery remains fragile amid risks of another pandemic resurgence leading to another round of countrywide lockdowns"". That should serve as a sober reminder to the next president and corporate bosses alike that, despite a rebound, there may yet be difficult days ahead for usa Inc. *"

A Chinese smartphone-maker takes advantage of a rival's misfortune
Lei jun, the founder and boss of Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone-maker, has long had something of an inferiority complex. For a decade Xiaomi has played second fiddle to Huawei, a rival Chinese producer of handsets. In a recent live-streamed address watched more than 30m times, Mr Lei admitted that his firm is not yet ""in the same league"" as Huawei. The audience, comprising mainly ""Mi fans"" (as devotees of Xiaomi products are known), booed the dispiriting assessment. That prompted Mr Lei to change tack, quickly adding that ""you will find lots of things we do well"".
Investors are not complaining. Xiaomi's share price has doubled since June. Its value surged to $8obn on November 5th. The main explanation is the flagging performance of none other than Huawei, which has been cut off from a critical resource-mobile chips-after export restrictions imposed by America came into effect on September 15th. The regulations prohibit chip manufacturers whose products contain American technology, including suppliers outside America, from selling to Huawei, which is accused of acting on behalf of the Communist Party. The chokehold is likely to depress Huawei's sales for the foreseeable future.
Xiaomi is better insulated from the geopolitical storm. Unlike Huawei, which sells telecoms gear to foreign network operators, Xiaomi runs only a consumer operation. It is thus less likely to stoke foreign ire. Big chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, for instance, continue to supply Xiaomi even as they are forced to cut ties with Huawei.
New data from Canalys, a research firm, suggest that Xiaomi is cashing in on Huawei's troubles. In the third quarter Xiaomi shipped 47m smartphones worldwide, up by 45% year on year. Huawei hawked more handsets, 52m units, but that is down by 23% from a year ago and the next quarter will almost certainly be even weaker. Xiaomi could soon overtake Huawei to become the world's second-biggest smartphone vendor-behind only Samsung, which shifted 80m units in the quarter. Xiaomi is the undisputed winner from Huawei's woes. Compared with the same period last year, third-quarter shipments from Samsung and Apple, which dispatched 43m handsets, barely budged. This suggests that consumers regard Xiaomi smartphones as a suitable substitute for Huawei's products.
Like its Chinese rival, Xiaomi tries to cater to every customer. Wealthier folk favour the flagship ""Mi"" phones. ""Redmi"" phones are aimed at the mass market (similar to Huawei's ""Honor"" series). This explains Xiaomi's popularity in both developed and developing countries. It is the leading smartphone supplier in markets as diverse as India and Spain. Apple's pricey products have less appeal in poorer countries.
The question is how long Xiaomi can sustain its fortuitous ascent. A new administration in America may lift restrictions against Huawei, enabling it to buy chips from global suppliers once again. If that happens, Xiaomi could be squeezed. To avoid this fate it talks of building on an ""ecosystem"" designed to keep customers interested. In addition to smartphones, which account for three-fifths of revenues, the company sells a range of smart devices, from light bulbs to electric scooters. It also offers fintech services like micro-lending. Xiaomi's sense of inferiority could be a thing of the past. *"

A socially distanced holiday season means less appetite for big birds
In barns or pens, or already in freezers, 40m American turkeys await their fate. More than half of the whole turkeys sold in America each year are eaten over Thanksgiving, which this year falls on November 26th. Most of the rest are polished off the following month, at Christmas. Social-distancing rules and travel restrictions mean that celebrations will look rather different in 2020-and so will the market for meat.
Some 30% of Americans say they will spend Thanksgiving with their immediate family only, up from 18% last year, according to Butterball, a North Carolina firm which rules the roost of turkey producers, supplying one in three Thanksgiving birds. Flight bookings for November are a third lower than last year, reports Skyscanner, a search platform, suggesting fewer people are going home for the holidays. In Britain, where 9m turkeys are usually eaten over Christmas, 61% of people say they are less likely than usual to have guests on Christmas Day, according to Kantar, a data firm.
Birds bred to feed large gatherings are therefore out of favour. Walmart and Kroger, large American food retailers, both plan to offer more small turkeys. However, ""a lot of supply for the holidays is locked in well before the fall,"" says Beth Breeding of America's National Turkey Federation, an industry group. It is too late for producers to switch to daintier varieties, since a hen takes 14-16 weeks to mature from hatchling to main course. Changing a bird's diet or the temperature of its surroundings can reduce its size, and it can be slaughtered earlier. But many Thanksgiving turkeys have already been dispatched and frozen, to fatten up inventory for the ""Super Bowl"" of the turkey calendar, as a Butterball spokesman describes it.
Some consumers may therefore end up buying spare parts cut from big birds. Walmart plans to increase by 20-30% its stock of breast meat, for families who can't manage a whole turkey. Such cuts command a premium but may mean that the leftover dark meat goes unsold. ""Whole birds are easier to produce and with no waste, so producers like them,"" says Richard Griffiths of the British Poultry Council. Some farmers are in a flap at the prospect that turkey could lose out to more petite meats. Kroger is buying in more ham, beef, porkroast and seafood, as well as vegetarian ""meatless roasts"".
Yet the signs are that most consumers want to stick to tradition. Although millions of people accustomed to their mother's cooking will have to fend for themselves this year, convenience products will mostly stay on the shelf, believes Scott McKenzie of Nielsen, another data company. Lockdowns have encouraged homely hobbies: Americans are buying 81% more yeast than last year and 41% more seaweed for wrapping home-made sushi, Nielsen reckons. Mr McKenzie expects increased demand for ""made-from-scratch"" products over the holidays, and beyond: ""Homebody habits are here to stay,"" he believes. If that is true, the glut of large turkeys may have a happy outcome: more leftovers. *"

A battle royale between the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles is kicking off. But gaming's prospects-and millions of new users-depend on streaming
There is nothing quite like a captive audience. When Sony, a Japanese electronics giant, reported its latest set of quarterly results on October 28th, the star performer was the firm's video-gaming division, which makes the PlayStation line of consoles. Had it been a normal year, revenues would probably have been down, because Sony's current model-the PlayStation 4-is coming to the end of its life.
But in a year marked by lockdowns and working from home, gaming revenue instead grew by 11.5% year-on-year (and operating profits by 61%) as housebound consumers reached for their controllers. Sony is not alone. Microsoft, its gaming arch-rival, released its own results the day before. Its Xbox One console is similarly superannuated, yet revenues jumped by 30%. The good times have been repeated across the industry (see chart).
Most forecasters expected covid-19 to boost the video-gaming business. The pandemic has given a filip to other forms of indoor entertainment, from board games to video-streaming to books. But the scale of the surge has caught industry-watchers by surprise. Tony Habschmidt, head of consulting at Newzoo, a games-industry analytics firm, says that when the pandemic began, his company predicted a boost of around $2bn to industry revenues on top of its existing forecasts. The latest figures, he says, suggest the real figure has been nearer $17bn. Newzoo now reckons industry revenues will reach $175bn this year, a rise of 20%. Even for an industry that had been growing by 9% annually, 2020 has been a barnstorming year.
It is not over yet. Amid a blitz of adverts, trailers and pr, Sony and Microsoft are gearing up to replace their existing consoles with new, more powerful machines. On November 10th Microsoft will release the Xbox Series X. Sony will respond two days later with the PlayStation 5. With a locked-down Christmas looming in many parts of the world, demand for both will be high. If industry rumours about pre-orders are correct, some consumers may have to go without.
At the same time, both firms will be keeping their eyes on several big new competitors. Amazon, Facebook and Google all think the time is right to try their luck in the gaming business. Over the past decade streaming has revolutionised music, television and films. The tech giants think cloud computing, fast broadband and 5G mobile networks mean the time is right to try the same thing with video games.
Start with the consoles themselves. Sony won the previous round of the console wars, selling over 100m PlayStation 4s and more than 1bn games. Microsoft does not provide official figures, but most analysts reckon that sales of the Xbox One (confusingly, the Xbox's third iteration) were only half as high. Most expect Sony to outsell its rival this time, too. Piers Harding-Rolls at Ampere Analysis, a mediaanalysis firm, thinks 5m new PlayStations will be sold in the run-up to Christmas, compared with 3.9m Xboxes.
One reason is brand loyalty. ""There's very much a cult following when it comes to consoles,"" says Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""PlayStation owners will mostly buy another PlayStation, and Xbox owners will get a new Xbox."" Another is Sony's strategy, which focuses on existing gamers. Analysts think the firm is selling the machines at a loss-a common tactic for console-makers. Sony's marketing has emphasised exclusive, bigbudget games that are aimed at committed gamers and are not available elsewhere.
Sony's executives will be hoping the analysts' projections are right, because the PlayStation 5 is vital to its future. The firm's gaming division is now its largest. Its recent success has cushioned the impact of problems elsewhere, such as in its imaging division, which has suffered from the troubles of Huawei, a Chinese tech giant that is one of its big customers (see Schumpeter).
Microsoft, for its part, professes itself unworried about precisely how many new Xboxes it sells. It is just as focused on expanding the market as on trying to win over existing gamers. More than 3bn people own smartphones, and mobile games- smaller and more casual than console titles-are the most popular sort of app. Phil Spencer, who runs Microsoft's Xbox division, estimates that only around 200m households worldwide are willing-or able-to splash out on an expensive piece of gaming hardware like a console.
Microsoft is therefore trying to lower the barriers to adoption. It will offer hirepurchase deals for its new Xbox. It is heavily promoting ""Game Pass"", a subscription service that offers access to an online library of hundreds of games for up to $15 per month (a quarter of the upfront cost of a typical high-end console game).
Cloud strife
The centrepiece of this strategy is a service called xCloud, which aims to remove the need to own a dedicated console at all, by running games in distant data-centres and streaming the results to smartphones, internet-connected tvs, or any screen that can be hooked up to the internet and a game controller.
In rich countries, streaming could let gamers play anywhere, not just at home- doing for games what Spotify and Netflix have done for music and films. In poorer countries, where smartphones are common and data plans are cheap, it could bring console gaming within the reach of millions of new players. ""There are 1.2bn people in Africa and the average age is 20,"" says Mr Spencer. ""Many of them follow our games-they know the characters, the stories, even the release dates. They just lack devices on which to play them"".
Game-streaming is not a new idea. Previous attempts have been plagued by technical problems (streaming a game, which must react instantly to a player's actions, is far harder than streaming a film or song to a passive viewer). And Microsoft is not the only firm that thinks the time is now ripe. Sony offers its own version, called ""psNow"" (though it is limited to older games), as does Nvidia, a gaming-focused chipmaker, and several other firms. Other tech giants with little experience of video-gaming are also piling in. Google launched ""Stadia"" in 2019. Amazon announced its ""Luna"" service in September. On October 26th Facebook threw its hat into the ring with its own ""Facebook Gaming"" service. 1
Game-streaming sounds attractive on paper, but few expect it to transform the industry overnight. ""I would describe the market as embryonic,"" says Mr HardingRolls. Still, there is huge interest: Ampere tracks 60 firms whose offerings are either in public testing or available for use. And if streaming does take off, it is likely to prove just as disruptive as it has been in other media. ""If you can make streaming work, you could grow the gaming market tenfold,"" reckons Mr Pachter. The videostreaming wars have seen deep-pocketed tech giants and media companies spend billions on content. Similar jockeying may be under way in games. On September 21st Microsoft bought ZeniMax Media, which makes the best-selling ""Fallout"" and ""Elder Scrolls"" series of games, for $7.5bn.
It is too early to pick out winners and losers, but most analysts think Microsoft is well positioned. Its Azure cloud business is the world's second-biggest, giving it a reach that many competitors lack. Last year Sony, which lacks cloud infrastructure of its own, said it was exploring the option of using Azure to power its own gaming services. And unlike Google or Amazon, its only real cloud rivals, Microsoft has decades of experience in the games business.
But its competitors have strong points, too. Amazon has 150m subscribers to its Prime service, which already includes streamed video and music. Google could leverage YouTube, where gaming videos are popular. Facebook plans to pitch its service at people who already play simpler, browser-based games on its existing platform, which boasts over 2bn users a month. And Sony's success with the PlayStation has proved that size is not everything. There is all to play for. *"

HERE IS A test. Assign a score of ito 5, where iis ""strongly agree"" and 5 is ""strongly disagree"", to the following statement: ""I really care about my work."" If you have answered that kind of question before, you have probably applied for a job at a large company. Psychometric tests, as they are called, have become increasingly popular.
Eager job-seekers may think the answers to these questions are glaringly obvious. For any statement, give a response that creates a portrait of a diligent, collaborative worker. Of course, applicants care about their work, love collaborating with other people and pay careful attention to detail. But the people who set the tests know that candidates will respond this way. So questions are rephrased in many different ways to check that applicants are consistent and make it difficult for them to remember what they have already said.
Aptitude tests are not a new idea. Intelligence tests have been around for a century and were popular with government departments. Charles Johnson, who has been involved in psychometric testing for 40 years and was responsible for constructing the tests used to recruit British civil servants, says the second world war had a big impact. The British were impressed with the efficiency of German army officers and learned they had been selected with the help of intelligence tests. This led the British to create the War Office Selection Board. Alongside verbal and non-verbal reasoning, it challenged candidates with wordassociation exercises and being made to lead group discussions.
For high-skilled jobs, these tests are useful. However, Mr Johnson says there is a risk with using such tests to recruit workers for low-skilled jobs. If you select people who pass sophisticated cognitive tests, they will learn the job quickly but will then get bored and leave.
Psychometric tests became more popular from the 1970s onwards and are now seen as a useful way of sorting through the many candidates who apply for the jobs offered by big companies. ""It is a laborious task to sort through thousands of written applications,"" says Julia Knight, another occupational psychologist. ""As well as being time consuming, it is not very effective and subject to bias.""
Questions in such tests may ask a candidate to describe their behaviour in hypothetical situations: dealing with an angry customer, for example. The suggested answers may all be plausible (apologise profusely, fetch a manager and so on), so there is no obviously ""right"" answer. Nevertheless the aim is to build a profile of the candidate to see if they have the right character traits for the job.
People are generally judged on the basis of five characteristics with the acronym ocean for openness, conscientiousness, extroversion (or introversion), agreeableness and neuroticism. The ideal characteristics can be surprising: it turns out that introverts are the best traindrivers as they seem to pay more attention to details such as safety procedures and can cope with spending long periods of their time on their own.
Extroverts do not make the best callcentre employees because they can spend so much time chatting to customers that they don't get much done. The most useful trait among such workers, according to Steve Fletcher, an occupational psychologist, is assertiveness; this enables them to deal with more calls.
These tests are used to assess senior managers, as well as new hires. Along with ocean characteristics, testers are also looking for what is known as the ""dark triad""-psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism. Factors that can make people successful as junior managers may limit their ascent. Candidates who are good with detail turn out to be obsessive micromanagers; people who flourish in sales may have an excessive need to be the centre of attention.
A large majority of big companies use these tests but they are hardly perfect. Paul Flowers, the former head of Co-op Bank, a British lender, passed his psychometric tests with flying colours, according to testimony at a parliamentary inquiry. But he was later ousted in a sex-and-drugs scandal that led him to be dubbed ""the crystal Methodist"". Mr Johnson says the tests can be useful, but only in conjunction with aptitude tests and structured interviews.
That probably won't save job candidates from having to take these tests in future, because they winnow down the list. But at least they beat the old-fashioned method: drop half the applications in the bin and pick from the other half."

IN THE 1990s, when a youthful Son Masayoshi, a Japanese entrepreneur, was pursuing acquisitions in his home country, he sought advice from a banker eight years his junior called Mikitani Hiroshi. They shared a lot in common: both had studied in America (Mr Son at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr Mikitani at Harvard Business School); they had a common interest in the internet; and they were both baseball mad.
In the decades since, both men have blazed past a stifling corporate hierarchy to become two of Japan's leading tech billionaires. Mr Mikitani, who says in an interview that he did not even know the word ""entrepreneur"" when he enrolled at Harvard, pioneered e-commerce in Japan via Rakuten, which is now a sprawling tech conglomerate worth $i4bn. Mr Son's SoftBank, after spectacular investments in early internet stocks, muscled into Japan's telecoms industry. They have both invested heavily in Silicon Valley. They also each own baseball teams named after birds of prey; the SoftBank Hawks and the Rakuten Golden Eagles.
Now it is rivalry, not a shared past, that better defines their relationship. In Japan SoftBank and Rakuten are elbowing their way onto each other's turf. Their respective investments overseas in Uber and Lyft, two ride-hailing firms, put them at odds. Even the Hawks and the Eagles are bitter enemies. Until recently Masa, as Mr Son is known, appeared to have the advantage. He has bigger money bags than Mr Mikitani, and a higher profile thanks to the audacity of his $ioobn Vision Fund, which backed blitzscaling tech startups globally. Yet Mickey, as Mr Mikitani is known, has made a quieter bet on mobile communications that is almost as bold-though in a different way. If it pays off, it could start a revolution not just in Japan, but across the world, too.
Discussing it by Zoom from his home in Tokyo, a hoodie-wearing Mr Mikitani is keen to emphasise both the audacity of the bet and the difficulty of bringing it to fruition. Since 2018 he has committed $8bn to build a fourth- and fifth-generation (5G) mobile network from scratch in Japan, a country where a triumvirate of industry heavyweights, including SoftBank, dominate. Instead of replicating the huge investments they have made in hardware, he used low-cost base stations, cloud-based architecture and software to create what Rakuten calls the world's first fully commercial virtualised network, adaptable for a new modular technology called OpenRAN. In essence, what Mr Mikitani has sought to show is that an internet firm like his, with a geeky software-engineering culture, can provide a high-quality, low-cost alternative to the hardware-obsessed telecoms giants, using OpenRAN at the core of its 5G architecture. It's a work in progress but it has been blessed with geopolitical tailwinds. Concerns about the influence of the Chinese government over Huawei, the world's biggest 5G equipment supplier, have caused telephone companies, as well as governments, to embark on a frantic hunt for alternatives. OpenRAN is attracting a lot of attention. All eyes are on Rakuten to see whether its network functions.
Mr Mikitani and his lieutenants are upbeat. Though he has faced naysayers all the way-""Good luck, Mickey, you're going to fail,"" he says his ceo friends all told him-the company has brought forward to 2021 the year when it expects to have coverage over almost all of Japan. It had been 2026. Low costs have lured more than 1m customers, even though coverage remains patchy. Globally, Tareq Amin, Rakuten's mobile-technology guru, has become one of the most prominent OpenRAN evangelists. In September he struck a deal with Madrid-based Telefónica, a big telecoms group, to develop the technology further. Mr Mikitani says one of the blessings of the OpenRAN model is that, rather than replacing antiquated kit with each new generation of mobile technology, it can be updated with software. He likens it to Tesla's ability to use software to upgrade its electric cars.
For all that, Mr Son is hovering menacingly in the background. Well before Mr Mikitani started to encroach on his telecoms territory, he used SoftBank's big stake in Yahoo Japan to challenge Rakuten in e-commerce. Last year SoftBank upped the stakes by orchestrating a merger between Yahoo Japan (now known as z Holdings) and Line, a messaging app, to create Japan's largest online services company. Kirk Boodry of Redex Research, an Asian equity-research firm, says Rakuten's e-commerce operating margins have fallen by half recently as it spends money to defend itself against both Yahoo and Amazon in e-commerce. That may eventually constrain Rakuten's telecoms ambitions. As he puts it: ""They don't have enough money to be as disruptive as they'd like to be.""
Mr Mikitani is gracious about his former client. He credits Mr Son with having a great eye for investments and tactfully does not mention the Vision Fund's debacle with WeWork, an office-rental firm that faced near-collapse last year. He insists SoftBank and Yahoo ""are my rivals, not my enemies"". He goes on to express the irony that whereas once he was Mr Son's investment banker, now, of the two, he is more of the operator.
Home RAN?
That raises the question of both men's legacy. Mr Son may have broken the mould for investing in snazzy startups in a way that put him on the cover of global magazines (including this one). Although he has a strong claim to be one of Japan's great entrepreneurs he has never pioneered a new technology. Mr Mikitani has never achieved such global stature. He is arguably more famous outside Japan for making English the lingua.franca in his company than for Rakuten itself. Yet if his 5G dreams come true, Mr Mikitani will have helped engineer a solution not only to a global technological problem but a pressing geopolitical one, too. As far as the tech world is concerned, that would be a more far-reaching achievement. And if Masa resents that, he can always get his talons out on the baseball field. *"

NEW YORK
Why the bond market might keep America's next president up at night
THE TREASURY market has long been able to strike fear into the hearts of the powerful. Frustrated by worries in the 1990s that bond yields would spike if Bill Clinton, then America's president, pushed through economic stimulus, James Carville, his adviser, joked that he wanted to be reincarnated as the bond market, because ""you can intimidate everybody"".
In the quarter-century since then, Treasuries have only become more pivotal to the world's financial system. The stock of tradable bonds amounts to $20.5trn, and is expected to approach 100% of America's gdp this year, roughly double the share in the 1990s (see chart). The dollar's dominance means that everyone holds them, from American banks and European pension schemes to Arab sovereign-wealth funds and Asian exporters. The yield on Treasuries is known as the ""risk-free"" interest rate, and underpins the value of every other asset, from stocks to mortgages. In times of stress investors sell racier assets and pile into Treasuries.
As The Economist went to press the outcome of America's presidential election was still unknown, but the likelihood of a Biden presidency and a Republican-controlled Senate was rising. The yield on tenyear Treasuries fell by 0.12 percentage points to 0.78% on November 4th, perhaps on expectations that government spending will be stingier than if a blue Democratic wave had swept over Congress. Still, the next president may find himself worrying about the bond market-not because of the vigilantes that annoyed Mr Carville, but because of the risk of a snarl-up in the bond market's plumbing, just as the scale of government borrowing rises sharply.
On October 14th Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's regulatory boss, said that the Treasury market's expansion over the past decade ""may have outpaced the ability of the private-market infrastructure to kind of support stress of any sort"". His comments were prompted by the fear of a repeat of the extreme stresses in March and April, as the economic threat of covid-19 became clear. Usually a haven, the Treasury market convulsed. The bid-ask spread- the gap between the price at which you can buy a bond and that at which you can sell- was 12 times its typical level. The spread between ""on-the-run"" bonds, which are recently issued and tend to be most liquid, and older ""off-the-run"" Treasuries widened. Investors rushed to dump their holdings. Municipal-bond yields, which tend to trade at 60-90% of Treasury yields, spiked above 350%. The chaos spread to corporate-debt markets and panicked equity investors, forcing the Fed to act.
To understand why the Treasury market broke down, consider how the burdens on the system have grown. The debt stock has risen from $5trn in 2007, owing to stimulus after the financial crisis, deficits under Donald Trump, and stimulus this year. At the same time, ""the provision of credit to households and businesses has become much more market-based and less bankbased,"" Nellie Liang of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, said at an event held by the New York Fed in September. Nonbank firms facing redemptions in a crisis rely on selling Treasuries to meet demand, placing further strain on the system.
As the demands upon them grew, though, the pipes through which Treasury trades are intermediated began to shrink. Trading depends on so-called ""primary dealers""-a handful of firms allowed to buy bonds directly from the American government. Access to issuance lets these dealers-largely housed inside big banks, like JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs-also dominate the intermediation of most Treasury trading. But their ability to make markets has been curtailed by tighter tions after the financial crisis, such as the introduction of the supplemental leverage ratio, which measures the total size of bank assets relative to the amount of capital they hold. The rule is ""not very friendly to lowrisk activities, which include buying Treasuries,"" says Pat Parkinson of the Bank Policy Institute, a lobby group.
In the spring the Fed eased pressures by buying Treasuries from market participants struggling to sell them to intermediaries. To encourage dealer activity it also allowed banks to exclude reserves held with the Fed and Treasuries from their leverage ratios. That marked the Fed's second intervention in a year. In September 2019 it eased the pressure on dealers after repo rates-the price paid to swap a Treasury overnight for cash, a key funding market for Treasuries-spiked to over 10%.
Such strains may become more apparent over time. Whatever the scale of stimulus enacted next year, the bond market will swell further. The Congressional Budget Office expects federal debt to be worth over $i20trn in 2050, or 195% of gdp. The result is that ""in ten or 15 years only half as big a shock as covid-19...would cause the same degree of Treasury-market dysfunction,"" noted Darrell Duffie of Stanford University, at the Fed's conference. ""And after that, yet smaller and smaller shocks would be enough to choke dealer balance-sheets with demands for liquidity.""
To ward off such a scenario, academics and market participants are considering how to revamp the system. The main principle involves expanding intermediation capacity. That could be done in many ways. Restrictions that curtail intermediation could be loosened; or the roster of primary dealers could be expanded, to include more banks and non-bank institutions.
Other solutions are more radical. Instead of trading through brokers, as they do today, market participants could trade directly with each other. At present counterparty risk deters direct trades; a central clearing-house-a solution proposed by Mr Duffie-could change that. With such a set-up in place, the market might not have seized up earlier in the year. ""We were actually in a position to be a liquidity provider,"" Sarah Devereux of Vanguard, a giant asset manager, said in September. ""It was hard to sell bonds, but it was also difficult to buy bonds, for example, off-the-run Treasuries, when they got to very attractive levels.""
The Fed could also make some of its interventions permanent. William Dudley, a former Fed official, favours a ""standing repo"" facility, which would allow holders of Treasuries to swap them for cash at any time, reducing the likelihood of a panic. Whatever the solution, the bond market's importance is such that it would be welcomed not only by America's lawmakers, but by the world's investors too. *"

CAN YOU identify what or whom the following describes: is widely disliked around the world; might have been ditched by some supporters earlier had convincing alternatives existed; has had a difficult six months; and refuses to go quietly? Here's another clue: this is not a column about politics. The answer is the dollar. It is the most unloved of major currencies, apart from all the others. And, oddly, it has been given a fillip by a messy election result at home.
Or perhaps that is not so odd. The dollar's resilience has been one of the more monotonous motifs in financial markets in recent years. Dollar strength is twinned with another hardy theme- the growing heft of America's companies, notably its tech giants, in global equity markets. The dollar matters for America, but it matters for everywhere else, too. A weaker dollar would trigger a period of catch-up by the rest of the world's economies and asset markets. Such a prospect is seemingly delayed.
A reason for dollar resilience is growing doubts over fiscal stimulus in America. The election was supposed to be the start of a new era of fiscal largesse. Agreeing on any kind of policy now looks hard. If Joe Biden enters the Oval Office in January he is likely to face a divided Congress. But dollar strength is not solely down to politics. It is as much about the economic consequences of a resurgent coronavirus as it is about dashed hopes of a blue-wave election.
Begin with the blue wave that didn't crest. Before the election, an idea had taken hold, fuelled by pollsters and election forecasters, that a clean sweep of the White House and both houses of Congress by the Democratic Party was highly likely. The upshot would be a weaker dollar.
In 2016 a similar prospect of fiscal easing drove the dollar up, not down. This needs some explaining. The difference is that four years ago, the Federal Reserve was expected to offset the stimulative effect of tax cuts by raising interest rates in order to contain inflation-thus supporting the dollar. But with the economy now weak, the Fed has committed itself to easy money. A fiscal-stimulus package would be an unimpeded spur to aggregate demand, leading to more imports, a wider trade deficit and a weaker dollar. And a weaker dollar would in turn help the rest of the world, partly because of its role as a borrowing currency beyond America's shores. A lot of emerging-market companies and governments have dollar debts, so a weaker greenback acts as an indirect stimulus to global growth.
Instead, the dollar has perked up a bit. That is because the dollar is special in another way. Dollar assets, notably shares, are more prized when the outlook seems less certain. Holders of dollars cling on to them for longer, rather than swap them for other currencies. This goes for wealthy savers in emerging economies, or Chinese or South Korean exporters, say, who have earned dollars on sales.
It also goes for institutional investors at home who might have thought of cashing in some of their expensivelooking American tech stocks for a wager on cheap-looking cyclical stocks in Europe or Asia. The diminished prospect of fiscal stimulus is one reason why this ""reflation trade"" is less alluring. The resurgence of coronavirus infections is another. Much of Europe is now in soft lockdown. Its economy is losing steam. The appeal of cyclical stocks is similarly ebbing. Investors have instead piled back into tech firms, which benefit from the stay-at-home economy.
If there is one thing as hardy as the dollar itself, it is forecasts that its resilience cannot last. What might hasten the dollar's fall now? Even without a friendly Senate to back his plans for increased federal spending, a President Biden would probably have a less bellicose and arbitrary trade policy than a re-elected President Trump. Good news on a vaccine might rekindle American investors' appetite for buying cheap assets abroad.
Further out, the dollar still seems likely to weaken. Whatever the configuration of American politics, fiscal stimulus will not stay off the agenda for ever. Populism is hardly in retreat. Bond yields are incredibly low. In the circumstances it would be unwise to think that politicians will forgo the temptations of deficit-financed spending or tax cuts for too long. And for the past half-decade the greenback has drawn strength from the fact that short-term interest rates in America were higher than in western Europe and Japan. One of the few things that everyone can agree on is that this advantage is largely gone."

HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI
The world's biggest ipo is now the world's biggest suspended ipo
JACK MA was in a triumphant mood shortly after Ant Group, his Chinese fintech firm, priced its initial public offering-set to be the world's biggest ever, with almost $40bn worth of shares sold. Speaking at a summit in Shanghai on October 24th, he chided regulators for being too focused on preventing financial risks. Red tape, he said, only held up innovation. Ten days later his words came back to haunt him. Less than 48 hours before its stock was to begin trading in Hong Kong and Shanghai, Ant was forced by Chinese regulators to halt the flotation.
The group said in a regulatory notice to the Hong Kong exchange that the ipo, scheduled for November 5th, had been suspended because the company ""may not meet listing qualifications or disclosure requirements"", after the regulator conducted an interview with Mr Ma and other executives. The filings also mentioned ""recent changes in the fintech regulatory environment"", hinting that newly published rules may have got in the way. The sudden suspension also suggests that some powerful officials may be displeased with Mr Ma, a self-made man who, by the conservative standards of big business in China, has an outspoken streak.
Yet the turn of events is not just painful for Ant. It reflects poorly on China's regulators. ipos are rarely stopped at such a late stage. The deal was more than 800 times oversubscribed in Shanghai, and in Hong Kong last week the firm closed its book a day early. It was set to float in Shanghai on the star market, China's answer to Nasdaq, designed to lure home Chinese tech groups that have listed abroad. Instead, the last-minute halt of Ant's listing highlights the opacity of the Chinese political system and the risks that can trip up even its most successful companies.
It is also easily the most public, and most disruptive, of Ant's run-ins with regulators. The company has consistently adjusted its business as the rules around it have shifted. The ipo debacle appears to be partly related to one such case. Back in 2018 officials placed caps on asset-backed securitisation, upending Ant's model of selling its loans on to banks. So it pioneered a new approach: consumers and merchants borrowed through Alipay, its payments service, on their smartphones, but the money came from banks. Ant was simply the conduit, collecting a ""technology-service fee"". This conduit business boomed, with credit growing to outstrip payments as Ant's biggest source of revenue.
On November 2nd the Chinese central bank and banking regulator published new draft rules for online micro-lending, which looked almost perfectly tailored to undercut Ant. Online lenders will need to fund at least 30% of any loan they supply jointly with banks. That could force Ant to keep much more of the credit that it originates on its books; currently, 98% is held as assets by other firms, off Ant's balance-sheet. Additional disclosure requirements could also make it much more cumbersome for banks to partner with the group. Officials at China's banking regulator have already pressed commercial lenders to adhere to the new rules, according to Bloomberg, in effect making many of Ant's transactions non-compliant.
Depending on how the rules are implemented-they will not be finalised until December-Ant's capital-light model could end up looking much less sleek. ""It will be valued more like a financial firm than a tech firm,"" said a strategist with an Asian sovereign-wealth fund. Given Ant's track record, it seems a fair bet that it will quickly adapt to the new rules, but its credit operations are likely to face much slower growth and lower profitability.
Investors had previously given Ant a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 40, in line with big global payments companies. Most Chinese banks, in contrast, trade on multiples of less than ten. Ant had been on track for a market capitalisation north of $300bn, higher than any bank in the world. Now it is likely to fall well short of that. Shares in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant that owns a third of Ant, tumbled by 8% after the suspension of the listing was announced.
Some investors may at least be grateful to regulators for introducing the new rules before the ipo, however late in the process, allowing them to reprice Ant before they buy its shares. But it is not as if the ipo came as a surprise or the company was an unknown entity; regulators could have acted far earlier. The possibility that they were motivated by a grudge against Mr Ma, and perhaps irritated by his recent speech, cannot be ruled out.
Ant had gone to great lengths to brand itself as a tech firm, not a bank. It describes its business as ""techfin""-ie, putting technology first-not fintech. In the lead-up to its listing, it asked brokerages to assign tech analysts, not just banking analysts, to cover it. Ultimately, though, its focus has always been on China's financial sector. That is the industry ripe for disruption, and where the money is. But as Ant and legions of investors have been reminded, that is also where the regulators lurk. *"

BEIRUT
How a Ponzi scheme run by Lebanon's central bank swamped its entire economy
George azzi no longer allows customers inside his pharmacy. Too many shops have been robbed. Instead he takes orders through a plexiglass window. But now, he jokes, there is not much left to steal. A currency crisis has left his shelves half-empty. A nearby petrol station has rationed supplies, limiting drivers to 20 litres. The supermarket around the corner has not stocked fresh chicken for weeks because poultry farmers will not sell at the government-mandated price.
Lebanon has spent the past year lurching from one crisis to the next: protests, covid-19, the catastrophic explosion at Beirut's port on August 4th. In the background all along has been a grinding economic collapse. Pegged for decades at 1,500 to the dollar, the Lebanese pound recently traded on the black market as low as 9,000. Annual inflation hit 120% in August. gdp may shrink by a quarter this year.
Subsidies have kept a few essentials affordable: medicine, fuel, a morning manoucheh (flatbread). But the central bank, the Banque du Liban (BdL), has less than $2bn in usable foreign-currency reserves remaining. By the year's end it will be unable to maintain its subsidy scheme, through which it grants importers of essential goods access to dollars at preferential rates. Some Lebanese have begun hoarding food and medicine in anticipation of far higher prices.
It will be the end of a monetary regime that once seemed inviolable. The peg helped restore confidence after a 15-year civil war, during which inflation peaked at 487% and the pound lost 80% of its value. But it was built on an unproductive economy and a complex series of transactions that, in recent years, came to resemble a Ponzi scheme. It has now collapsed. Yet Lebanon's political and financial elites- sometimes one and the same-are unwilling to bear the costs of fixing it. Instead they have forced the economy into a brutal self-correction, with the heaviest consequences piled on ordinary citizens.
Most Arab states with fixed currencies defend their pegs with revenue from oil and gas exports. Lebanon has none. It has few goods exports at all: at their peak in 2012 they came to $4.4bn, against $2i.ibn in imports. Other sources of hard currency, such as tourism and property, were insufficient to sustain a peg, with current-account deficits exceeding 25%, and fiscal deficits of over 10%, of gdp.
It did have one reliable source of dollars: a vibrant financial sector that, at its peak in 2018, held 269trn pounds of deposits, then worth $179bn-more than three times the country's gdp. About two-thirds of deposits were in dollars. To funnel some of that into its coffers the BdL crafted a scheme it called ""financial engineering"". Starting in 2016 it exchanged local-currency debt with the finance ministry for dollar-denominated bonds, which it sold to 1 commercial banks with high rates of return. Banks could also borrow pounds against their dollar deposits at the BdL, then lend them back to it, with a spread of 11 percentage points on the transaction.
The longtime central-bank governor, Riad Salamé, defends the scheme as a short-term fix. In his telling the BdL did not create Lebanon's deficits: those were the work of politicians who failed even to pass a budget between 2005 and 2017. True enough-but the scheme made those debts possible and tied everyone in a web of mutual liabilities. By 2018 the BdL was financing most of the fiscal deficit, and by 2019 most of Lebanon's public debt (more than 80% of local-currency debt and 60% of foreign-currency bonds) was owned by banks and the BdL. The banks, in turn, deposited more than half their liquidity with the BdL. In its annual assessment of the Lebanese economy, the imf reckoned that banks' combined exposure to the BdL and the government amounted to 69% of their total assets in May 2019, more than eight times their Tier 1 capital, largely due to the rise in their deposits with the central bank.
Sustaining this house of cards required an ever larger supply of fresh dollars, which necessitated ever higher yields to lure depositors. Average interest rates on dollar deposits climbed from 3% in 2016 to almost 7% three years later. But after a decade of growth, bank deposits flattened off in late 2018, in part because low oil prices hurt the Gulf economies where many Lebanese work. Last year they began to decline. Short of cash, banks severely curtailed dollar withdrawals. Credit cards that once financed trips to Europe now carry spending limits of $50. In March the state defaulted when it failed to make a payment of $1.2bn on a hard-currency bond. The prime minister at the time, Hassan Diab, estimated an $83bn loss in the banking sector.
Most customers can withdraw their dollar savings only in local currency (Dan Azzi, a former executive at Standard Chartered, a bank, dubbed these ""lollars""). Since April the BdL has allowed withdrawals at an above-market exchange rate, currently 3,900 pounds to the dollar. That is still up to 55% below the black-market rate-""a massive haircut on the Lebanese,"" says Alain Bifani, who resigned in June after 20 years as the director-general of the finance ministry. Despite the haircut, people have rushed to withdraw deposits. Cash in circulation was up 274% in the year to August.
Mr Diab proposed shifting more of the losses on to banks, rather than entirely on their depositors. His cabinet approved a plan in April calling for a bail-in, wiping out shareholders and imposing a haircut on wealthy depositors. He also began talks with the imf about a financial agreement worth up to $10bn. The fund was broadly supportive of his plan, but it was doomed by lobbying from banks. They have strong allies in parliament: most of Lebanon's big banks are at least partly owned by politicians or their families. In meetings with the imf, bankers would not even agree on the scale of Lebanon's losses, insisting that Mr Diab's numbers were exaggerated.
Mr Diab has since resigned as prime minister, though he remains caretaker. His designated successor, Saad Hariri, who is still struggling to cobble together a government, is unlikely to take up his ideas. He had been prime minister before, when the financial-engineering scheme was in full swing, and his family has a stake in BankMed, one of the country's largest banks (his stepmother serves as vicechair). Instead the association of banks has suggested selling $40bn in state assets to help clean up the mess. Critics argue this wildly overstates the value of Lebanon's assets, among them an electric company that cannot provide 24-hour electricity and a telecoms monopoly that offers some of the world's slowest internet speeds. Neither is likely to prompt a bidding war when a bankrupt state dumps them in a fire sale.
The BdL, once again, is left to pursue its policies, some of which seem to be attempts to keep the Ponzi scheme going. In August it told banks to boost their capital by 20% or ""exit the market"" in February next year. Depositors who have transferred at least $500,000 abroad since 2017 would be encouraged to repatriate 15% of that sum, and 30% for politically exposed persons. Banks may offer ""incentives"" to grease the wheels. What would incentivise customers to send money to an insolvent banking system was left unclear. Efforts to audit the central bank, meanwhile, have met with months of obstruction.
Even the good news is bad. The trade deficit fell by 51% in the first quarter, but mainly because few Lebanese can afford imported goods. Banks have fewer liabilities-customer deposits were down by 16% in August, compared with the previous year-but partly because depositors who need cash are taking haircuts to withdraw devalued pounds. Politicians and bankers still hope to avoid a reckoning, even as the economy crumbles around them. But they have nowhere left to turn. *"

How economically damaging will new lockdowns be?
Countries notched up absurdly high growth rates in the third quarter. America's gdp rose by 7.4%, compared with the second (an annualised rate of 33%). Output in the euro area grew by 12.7%. But there is little reason for cheer. The resurgence of covid-19, and lockdowns to contain the virus, seem likely to stop the economic recovery in its tracks. Such fears drove oil prices to a five-month low on November 2nd.
Using mobility data from Google, The Economist has constructed an index of real-time economic activity. This suggests that America's recovery has come to a halt as recorded covid-19 cases have risen again. Europe, with a higher number of infections, is faring worse. Activity in Britain and France seems to have peaked in September and performance is set to slip given that Britain, France and Germany returned to varying degrees of lockdown in the past week or so.
It is too soon to see the full impact of these new lockdowns in our index. They should at least be less damaging than those earlier in the year: more manufacturing and construction firms, for instance, will stay open this time. Still, the experience of places that have already locked down suggests they will be painful. Ireland's restaurants have more or less been closed since it locked down on October 21st. Wales locked down two days later; our index suggests activity in Cardiff, its capital city, has fallen by 20 percentage points. Based on past relationships, a similar decline in European countries would cause gdp to be 5% lower in the fourth quarter."

For the past quarter-century, growth came so easily to the developing world that it can be hard to remember it was ever otherwise. Fuelled by globalisation, real gdp per person in emerging economies more than doubled from 1995 to 2019, in purchasingpower-parity terms. In advanced countries, by contrast, it grew by only 44%. The burst of growth consigned to the scrapheap decades' worth of arguments about whether and how poor countries could catch up with rich ones. But explosive trade growth has ended, and the industrialised world is turning inward. Some governments are therefore dusting off old ideas. Among them is ""importsubstituting industrialisation"" (isi), a strategy that seeks to develop industrial capacity by shielding domestic producers from foreign competition. Many countries may feel they have little choice but to give the idea a try, but as the conditions that might allow it to succeed are generally absent in the poorest of economies, the revival seems doomed to fail.
Between 1990 and 2008, global trade as a share of gdp rose from 39% to 61%. This ""hyperglobalisation"", as Martin Kessler and Arvind Subramanian of the Peterson Institute for International Economics dubbed it, facilitated rapid, broad-based economic expansion. After the late 1990s growth in incomes per head in nearly three-quarters of developing countries outpaced that in America, by an average of more than three percentage points a year. Global supply chains proliferated. Countries with a small industrial base, or none at all, could export manufactured goods by finding niches in production chains, following a shortcut to industrialisation.
The era of openness, however, is drawing to a close. The share of trade in world gdp fell after the global financial crisis; last year it was still below its 2008 peak. The level of world trade is forecast to fall by more than 9% this year. In America and Europe shortages of medical supplies and a souring relationship with China have rekindled interest in protecting domestic producers. But it is the biggest winners of hyperglobalisation, such as China and India, that are leading the way back to isi . The share of foreign value-added in China's exports fell by almost ten percentage points from 2005 to 2016; its government's ""Made in China 2025"" campaign aims to make it self-sufficient in the production of many key goods. In India, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, unveiled a campaign for self-reliance as part of his pandemic-recovery package in May.
As poor-country politicians often point out when pressed by rich-world leaders to liberalise, many of today's advanced economies practised elements of an isi strategy as they industrialised. Alexander Hamilton, America's first treasury secretary, used tariffs to protect domestic manufactures and reduce its dependence on Britain. In the 19th century European rivals worried that abundant British manufactures would stunt industrial development and leave them at a permanent military disadvantage. Governments erected tariff barriers and mobilised domestic capital, often squeezed out of the agricultural sector, towards state-supported industry. Russia and Japan followed western Europe in promoting domestic industry as a matter of national security.
Still, past experience also shows why the renewed interest in isi may be misguided. Its intellectual heyday was in the 1950s, when economists like Raúl Prebisch and Gunnar Myrdal (the latter a Nobel prizewinner) argued against a laissez-faire approach to trade in developing economies. Their views were informed by the constraints of their era. Poor countries were desperately short of hard currency with which to obtain imports after the second world war. The replacement of some imports with domestic production was seen as a way to ration foreign exchange. More generally, advocates for isi rejected the idea that specialisation and trade would leave every economy better off. Poor countries that stuck to their comparative advantage would remain exporters of primary products for ever, it was thought, never making the leap to industrialisation and the higher incomes it would bring.
The flaws of isi rather quickly became apparent, though. Many governments used it to bestow favours upon domestic industries based on political self-interest rather than rational economic calculation. The enthusiasts among economists lost interest. Tariff barriers left some countries nearly closed off to trade. Meanwhile, import-substituting economies in Latin America and South Asia fell behind a handful of others that opted instead to promote exports made with abundant cheap labour. Export-orientation was not a sure route to development; success stories like South Korea and Taiwan were rare before the emerging-market acceleration of the 1990s. Nor was it a laissez-faire endeavour; the governments of the Asian Tigers meddled extensively in their economies, subsidising favoured industries and firms. But global competition placed relentless pressure on exporters, forcing them to become more efficient and encouraging the acquisition of technical knowhow. Those in isi economies, sheltered behind high tariffs, tended instead to be small, inefficient and complacent.
A matter of great imports
What does all this mean for the revival in isi today? In economies with large domestic markets and capable states, import substitution may well allow governments to achieve strategic goals without nudging firms into growth-sapping complacency. China probably fits the bill. In India, with its poorer and less integrated domestic market, the strategy is riskier.
In smaller economies with weak institutions, however, isi-related policies are doomed to fail. The consumers, competition and technologies that developing economies can only find on global markets are a crucial prerequisite for their industrialisation. If the world's biggest economies focus on their own strategic interests alone, they will deprive others of access to these precious resources-and the golden age of emerging-market growth will become an ever more faded memory. *"

Mixing supercapacitors and batteries may give electric cars what they need to overcome customer resistance
When it comes to putting on pace, some electric vehicles rely not only on a battery to deliver the necessary wattage, but also on a second source of power called a supercapacitor. The battery serves as a marathon runner, providing a steady discharge over a long distance. The supercapacitor is a sprinter, unleashing a large amount of energy rapidly.
Speedy discharge is not the only advantage supercapacitors bring. They can be recharged more quickly, too. That makes them particularly useful in regenerativebraking systems, since they are able to absorb more of the electricity that is produced as a vehicle slows down. They can, though, store only a fraction of the amount of energy which a battery stuffs away. They therefore soon run out of puff. Because of this, engineers have been trying for a while to hybridise the best bits of a supercapacitor with the most useful features of a battery, to make a storage device with both speed and endurance. They are now having some success. Indeed, NAWATechnologies, near Aix-en-Provence, France, claims its supercapacitor-like battery could more than double the range of an electric car, allowing it to be driven for 1,000km on a single charge. This new device could also, NAWA says, be recharged to 80% of its capacity in as little as five minutes.
The science bit
Capacitors and batteries work in different ways, so combining them is tricky. A capacitor stores energy physically, in the form of static electricity. This is easily and rapidly discharged, so capacitors have good power density (the rate at which they transfer energy, per unit of weight). A decent modern supercapacitor has a power density of several kilowatts per kilogram.
Batteries store their energy chemically, in the form of reactive substances in their two electrodes. These electrodes are held physically apart, but are connected by a material called an electrolyte through which charged atoms, known as ions, can pass from one to the other, in order to permit a reaction to proceed. That, though, happens only when the ion flow is balanced by a flow of electrons through an external circuit between the electrodes. This electron flow is the electric current which is the reason for the battery's existence.
Controlled in this way, chemical reactions take time, so batteries have low power density. A lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery of the sort used in electric cars might thus muster only a tenth of a kilowatt per kilogram. But chemicals can hold a lot of energy, so batteries have high energy density (the amount of energy they can contain, again per unit weight). A Li-ion battery can store 200-300 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). Supercapacitors generally manage less than 10wh/kg.
Capacitors, by contrast-whether basic or ""super""-consist of a pair of electrically conductive plates placed either side of a separator material. When a voltage is applied to these plates, a positive charge builds up on the surface of one and a corre- sponding negative charge on the other. Connect the plates through an external circuit and, as with a battery, a current will then flow.
Making the leap from a basic capacitor to the super variety involves two things. One is to coat the plates with a porous material such as activated carbon, to increase the surface area available for energy storage. The other is to soak them in an electrolyte. This creates yet more storage area in the form of the electrolyte's boundary with the plates. But adding an electrolyte to the mix also brings the possibility of adding a bit of battery-like electrochemistry at the same time. And Skeleton Technologies, an Estonian supercapacitor firm, plans to do just that.
Plate tectonics
Skeleton has already developed plates composed of what it calls ""curved"" graphene, for a new range of straightforward supercapacitors. Ordinary graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal grid. It is highly conductive. Skeleton's curved variety consists of crumpled sheets of the stuff. The consequent increase in surface area will, the firm hopes, push the energy density of its new products to io-i5wh/kg-a good fraction of the theoretical maximum for a supercapacitor of 20-30wh/kg.
That, though, is just the start of Skeleton's plan. The firm's engineers are now working with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, in Germany, to use curved graphene in what it calls its ""SuperBattery"". Though this remains basically a supercapacitor, storing most of its charge electrostatically, the electrolyte will, says Sebastian Pohlmann, Skeleton's head of innovation, also provide some chemicalenergy storage. The company is keeping mum about the electrolyte it uses and the chemistry involved. ""It is not comparable to the classic lithium-ion chemistry,"" is all that Dr Pohlmann will say. But the overall consequence, he claims, will be something that is rechargeable within 15 seconds and has the ability to store 6owh/kg. Skeleton aims to start producing this commercially by 2023.
Other groups, too, are working on ways to add chemical-energy storage to a supercapacitor. Researchers at Graz University of Technology in Austria, for example, have developed a version that has its electrical contacts coated with carbon which is pierced by tiny pores. One contact operates like a capacitor plate, the other like a battery electrode. Unlike Skeleton, the Graz group are open about their approach to electrolyte chemistry. They are using aqueous sodium iodide (ie, a solution of sodium ions and iodine ions). At the electrode, the iodide turn into elemental iodine, which crystallises within the pores during discharge. This process then reverses itself when the device is charging. The pores in the plate serve to accommodate sodium ions similarly.
According to a paper its inventors published recently in Nature Communications, the Graz cell's performance exceeds that of a Li-ion battery. It is able, for example, to cope with up to im charge and discharge cycles, says Qamar Abbas, a member of the team. A Li-ion equivalent might be expected to manage a couple of thousand cycles.
Both Skeleton and the Graz group, then, are taking modified supercapacitor architecture and adding some bespoke electrochemistry. By contrast, although the offering from NAWATechnologies does indeed also employ modified supercapacitor plates as its electrodes, it uses tried and trusted Li-ion ingredients for the chemical donkey work.
Like Skeleton, NAwA already manufactures supercapacitors. The plates for these are created using a process which the firm calls VACNT (vertically aligned carbon nanotubes). This arranges those tubes in an array that resembles, in miniature, the bristles on a brush. Extreme miniature. A square centimetre contains about ioobn of them, all standing to attention. That greatly increases the surface area available to hold an electric charge.
To adapt vacnt plates to operate also as battery-like electrodes, nawa's engineers have thinned the nanotube forest to make room for coatings of the chemicals which batteries employ for their reactions, and also for the movement of lithium ions into and out of the spaces between the tubes. This freedom of movement, the company reckons, will boost the arrangement's power density by a factor of ten.
To start with, the nanotubes of the invention's cathode (the positive electrode in a battery) will be coated with nickel, manganese and cobalt, a mixture already widely used to make such cathodes. Conventional anodes (the negative electrodes) are already carbon based, so using that element in the form of nanotubes is not a big departure. Other, less commercially developed battery chemistries should, though, also work with vacnt electrodes. These include lithium-sulphur and lithium-silicon, both of which have the potential to increase energy densities.
Silicon is particularly promising, but it swells as it absorbs ions, and that can rupture a battery. The thicket of nanotubes in a vacnt electrode should operate like a cage to keep the silicon in check, says Pascal Boulanger, a physicist who helped found nawa in 2013. The new electrode material could also be used with solid rather than liquid electrolytes, to make ""solid-state"" batteries. These are powerful and robust, but are proving tricky to commercialise.
Bristling to work
In tests with a number of unnamed battery companies, Dr Boulanger says vAcNT electrodes achieved an energy density of 5oowh/kg in one battery and up to 1,400 watt-hours per litre in another. This is roughly double what a typical Li-ion battery can manage in terms of weight and volume respectively. ""We have done that very easily,"" he adds, ""so we believe there is more room for improvement.""
One firm that nawa does admit to working with is Saft, a large batterymaker owned by Total, a French oil giant keen to diversify from fossil fuels. Among Saft's customers are several Formula 1 teams which use some electric power in their racing cars. Saft has also teamed up with psa group, a big European carmaker, to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles.
Naturally, the new device's success will depend on the cost of manufacturing it. nawa is already constructing a mass-production line to make vacnt plates for its latest supercapacitors. The process used, which grows nanotubes on both sides of a roll of aluminium foil, would, says Ulrik Grape, nawa's chief executive, transfer easily to an existing battery-production line and might even reduce battery-making costs. He expects the first versions of the supercapacitor-battery hybrids to be in production by 2023.
Whether such hybrid storage will be able to compete with conventional Li-ions remains to be seen. Li-ion batteries have the advantage of incumbency, and batterymakers have invested billions of dollars in huge ""gigafactories"" to turn them out in droves. Yet, for all the hype surrounding electric cars, doubts about Li-ions linger in many customers' minds. Range-anxiety, recharge rate and cost all combine to induce a hesitation to reach for the credit card. Mixing the spice of a supercapacitor with the stamina of a battery might overcome at least the first two of these objections, and thus, at last, truly launch an era of carefree electric motoring. *"

The T-cell response to covid-19 lasts at least six months. That is good news
Since the beginning of 2020 medical researchers have been in hot pursuit of covid-19. One of their most important goals is to understand the immune response to sars-cov-2, the virus that causes it. Finding out what a good response looks like, and how long it lasts, is crucial. The answers will reveal whether people who have recovered from the illness are protected from a second infection, and also indicate how difficult it will be to develop a vaccine.
There is much to worry about. Over the past year, many reports have shown rapidly waning levels of covid-specific antibodies after the initial burst caused by an infection. Antibodies are parts of the immune system that attack the virus directly. They are expected to be involved in any longterm protection against reinfection. If they disappear quickly, that looks, on the face of things, like bad news. Worriers also highlight the facts that immunity to types of coronavirus which cause the symptoms described as ""a cold"" is short-lived, and that there are already a number of proven cases of reinfection with sars-cov-2.
Yet antibodies tell only part of the story. Another important actor is the т-cell (pictured above). Rather than attacking viruses directly, т-cells attack infected cells, to stop the virus reproducing. The balance of importance of the antibody and т-cell arms of the immune system varies with the illness in question. And, as far as this particular infection is concerned, although almost all patients who catch sars-cov-2 are thought to create т-cells in response, an understanding of their significance has been elusive.
This is largely because т-cells are harder to measure than antibodies, and so are less often studied. Shamez Ladhani, a consultant epidemiologist with Public Health England, a government health-protection agency, who has worked on a new, longterm investigation of these cells, says it took nearly three weeks to count them in the 100 patients his study looked at. The effort was worthwhile, though, because it has shed new light on how long-lasting this form of immunity to sars-cov-2 might be.
To a T?
Dr Ladhani's project is part of a wider effort focused on health-care workers that Public Health England began in March. Over 2,000 people have donated blood samples every month since then. The 100 he and his colleagues have studied are a subset of these. In a paper just published as a preprint, but not yet peer reviewed, they say that six months after infection all of these patients, even those who had had only mild symptoms, or none at all, still had detectable levels of т-cells directed against the virus. Though their antibodies might have vanished, т-cells remained on the scene.
These findings bode well for the idea that т-cells offer long-term protection against reinfection, says Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology at the University of Edinburgh. And Paul Moss, a haematologist at the University of Birmingham, says that his experience with other viruses leads him to expect the т-cell response Dr Ladhani has observed will last many more months than the six it has persisted for so far. In SARS-cov-1, the name now given to the virus that caused the original sars outbreak, in 2002-03, this form of cellular immunity was found to last in some people for over a decade. The long-lived nature of such т-cell responses fits in with the observation that, so far, reinfections seem rare.
Dr Moss says the implication of the new study is that those searching for vaccines against covid-19 should give priority to the production of т-cells. There is more good news here. Two of the leading candidates- one from a collaboration between Pfizer, an American drug company, and BioNTech, a German biotech firm, and the other from a second joint effort, between AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish drug company, and the Jenner Institute of Oxford University-do exactly this, while also stimulating the production of antibodies. Speaking in July, when the first results from the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine were published, Adrian Hill, the Jenner Institute's boss, was keen to highlight the ""excellent"" т-cell response their vaccine created. ""That is what this vaccine type does,"" he explained. ""That is what it is designed for.""
The significance of т-cells was obvious to Pfizer and BioNTech as well. In July they switched the focus of their efforts in response to data suggesting that an experimental vaccine they had hitherto regarded as secondary was eliciting strong т-cell responses. The coming weeks are likely to produce results concerning whether one or more of these putative vaccines actually provides protection against covid-19. That the two leading candidates provoke strong т-cell responses is grounds for optimism that vaccinology is on the right track.
As for the vanishing antibodies, there may be grounds for optimism here, too. The fact that levels of these proteins wane rapidly after infection, when they are no longer needed, should not be so surprising. It might not matter, either. The immune system could well be primed to make them in large numbers again, if and when it reencounters sars-cov-2. It is also worth remembering that, even if researchers cannot detect antibodies, that does not mean they are not there at all.
As winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, the scientific fight against covid-19 feels more urgent than ever. But, while it is true that science has not yet jammed the pandemic exit doors open, there are now at least a few shafts of light emerging around the doorway. *"

Earnshaw's theorem says magnetism cannot be created remotely. It can
Two centuries ago Hans Christian Oersted, a Danish physicist, demonstrated that the motion of an electric charge produces magnetism. This was the first observation of a wide-ranging phenomenon. The charged clouds of particles which float through the cosmos generate vast interstellar magnetic fields as they go. The sloshing of molten metal in Earth's core produces the planet's north and south magnetic poles. Even the firing of nerve cells in a human brain creates a minuscule amount of magnetism.
The ubiquity of such electrically generated magnetic fields does, though, bring problems ranging from the pragmatic to the esoteric. Doctors looking at mri scans, for example, have to compensate for background magnetism. Meanwhile, experimentalists conducting precision tests may have to build complex shields to obscure the magnetic effect of something as simple as an electric wire running through the wall of their laboratory.
It would be useful, then, to be able to control, limit or shape magnetic fields from a distance. Useful, but apparently impossible. For, in 1842, Samuel Earnshaw, a British physicist, demonstrated mathematically that the maximum strength of a magnetic field cannot lie outside its source. Every such field must, in other words, surround and radiate from the object which generates it. And there matters stood until Rosa Mach-Batlle of the Autonomous University of Barcelona spotted a way around Earnshaw's conclusions. She has not actually proved him wrong. But she has shown that multiple magnetic fields, each obeying Earnshaw's theorem individually, can collectively appear to bypass it.
As they describe in Physical Review Letters, Dr Mach-Batlle and her colleagues pulled off their trick in a surprisingly simple way, by arranging 20 straight wires next to one another in the form of a cylinder 40cm tall and 8cm in diameter, with a 21st running through the cylinder's centre. When they passed electric currents through all 21 wires a complex pattern of magnetic field lines blossomed in the surrounding area, forming shapes which varied with the strength and direction of the individual currents.
By choosing the right combination of currents the researchers found they were able to create a field pattern which emanated from a virtual version of the 21st wire that ran not through the middle of the cylinder but, rather, 2cm outside it. In other words, if the apparatus doing the generating were to be shielded from an observer, Wizard of Oz-style, by a curtain, it would look to that observer as if this field was appearing from nowhere.
Going from Dr Mach-Batlle's demonstration to something which could be used in practice to manipulate distant magnetic fields will be a long journey. But if that journey can be made, potential applications go way beyond cleaning up fuzzy mri scans. Remotely cast fields of this sort might be used to steer medical nanobots through someone's bloodstream to deliver drugs to a particular tissue, or else to guide them towards a malignant tumour and remotely raise their temperature once they have arrived, in order to cook it to death. There are also likely to be applications in quantum computing. Many designs for quantum computers rely on trapping atoms at precise locations in space-a difficult feat which this sleight of hand could simplify.
The trick still requires refining. To achieve such desired applications the team need to be able to sculpt intricate magnetic fields in three dimensions. At present, limited as they are to emulating the field generated by a single electric wire, they cannot do this. But it is worth remembering that Oersted's original experiment, from which the whole of electrical engineering ultimately descends, was even simpler. It involved only a battery, a magnetic compass and a single wire. Great oaks from little acorns grow. *"

The colour black has long been the ultimate test of an artist's ingenuity
Claude monet died in darkest December in 1926 surrounded by the garden he had created at Giverny. When Georges Clémenceau, the former French prime minister, arrived three days later for the artist's funeral and caught sight of the blackdraped coffin, he exclaimed: ""No! No black for Monet."" An old piece of cretonne was brought down from the house to replace the dark pall with the palette that the artist had made his own: nature's many greens, lavender, water lilies and forget-me-nots.
Most colours represent different things for different people. The hue of death in India and in some Slavic cultures is white, yet white also means spiritual rebirth for Muslims participating in the haj. Green was for bankers in early modern Europe; in the Kenyan flag it represents the land. Red is the badge of loyalty and success in China and of power and devotion in Russia. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's New England it was the sign of adultery. Black, however, has associations that are universal. It is bound up with witchcraft, the underworld, nighttime and the far side of the Moon.
Physicists say it is not really a colour at all. Because black is the result of the absence of light, Sir Isaac Newton did not see it on the spectrum of colours in his experiments with prisms in the late 1660s. Many artists take a different view. For them black represents an intellectual and technical challenge; it is the high-jump of colour, a test of their skill, ingenuity and imagination. (Black skin has its own, entwined but distinct, artistic history, with vexed connotations of power, prejudice and eroticism.)
The latest attempt to plumb these depths comes from Anish Kapoor, a British-Indian artist whose work questions notions of perception. He has co-opted a revolutionary black material which, he hopes, will break completely new ground. ""I'm really invested in the process of what is real and what is not real,"" Mr Kapoor says. ""What is an appearance? What's a trick? What's an illusion?""
The discovery in ancient Egypt, China and Rome that writing (and, later, printing) worked best when black was used on a white background gives black a special place in the pantheon of colours. But before the concoction in Europe of black ink from gall nuts (tumours that grow on trees where insects have laid eggs), real black was hard to conjure up. The early artists in France's Lascaux caves drew crude animals and human figures with charcoal, which sometimes washed away. Most confected blacks, especially fabric dyes, produced a muddy purply-grey or brown at best.
No colours any more
It was only when black pigments-made from coal, lampblack or even burned ivory-were successfully mixed with gum arabic or linseed oil that it became possible to create the black gloss that many European artists came to love. Caravaggio revolutionised Baroque painting with his studies of darkness; yet it was the Spaniards of a generation later, when black was the colour of high fashion, who made black painting all their own, starting with the power portraits of Diego Velázquez and the brooding figures that haunt the tall works of Francisco de Zurbarán. ""Black became the colour of distinction,"" Philip Ball, the author of 1 ""Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Colour"", has said. It wasn't only a hue in its own right, artists realised, but an enlivener of other colours.
The myth of Orpheus, who descends into the blackness of the underworld to bring his dead wife, Eurydice, back to the land of the living, has inspired musicians, poets and painters. None more so, perhaps, than Samuel Palmer. Retreating from the problems associated with the Industrial Revolution, in the 1820s Palmer went with a band of like-minded spirits to live in the Kent countryside where he witnessed nights that were blacker than anything he had ever seen. The series of works inspired by his nocturnal ramblings represented something of an epiphany for Palmer. He called them ""my blacks"" or ""little moonshines"", for the intensity they project is due almost entirely to the blackness of his night sky, as can be seen, for example, in a tiny picture called ""Cornfield by Moonlight, with the Evening Star"".
Unlike Palmer and other Romantics, Monet and some of his fellow Impressionists banished black entirely. Édouard Manet, however, took it on. When he painted his disciple and future sister-in-law, Berthe Morisot, in 1872, he dressed her all in black with a matching hat. With one side of her face lit up gloriously and the other darkly shaded, it is her eyes that capture the viewer's attention; in life they were green, but Manet made them profound by painting them black. ""Manet was the strongest of us all,"" his friend, Camille Pissarro, once said. ""He turned black into light.""
Until my darkness goes
In the 20th century, Pablo Picasso used black to ask how God could possibly exist amid so much suffering. ""Guernica"", his visual poem in black-and-white about the Spanish civil war, recalls the use of black in Francisco Goya's prints, ""The Disasters of War"". Perhaps the shade's most ambitious devotee was Kazimir Malevich, a Russian artist who enlisted black to invent a whole new painterly language that elevated feelings over representation. He called this movement ""suprematism"".
""Trying desperately to free art from the dead weight of the real world,"" he later wrote, ""I took refuge in the form of the square."" Malevich painted many squares of different colours, but ""Black Square"" (see picture) is the one people remember. Unveiled against the backdrop of the first world war and turmoil in Russia, Malevich's ""Black Square"" marked a turningpoint in modern art.
Malevich was a huge influence on his successors, especially the American abstract expressionists, but time has not been kind to ""Black Square"", at least not physically. These days it is shrunken, cracked and slightly miscoloured. All the same, the challenge that it represented to artists is as powerful as ever.
It was exactly a century after ""Black Square"", in 2015, that Mr Kapoor secured the rights to make art using Vantablack, the blackest black ever created. It is not a paint so much as a dense coating of tiny ""nanotubes""-""Vanta"" stands for ""vertically aligned nanotube array""-which, instead of reflecting light, traps it almost completely. (It was developed as a material that might be useful in hiding satellites.) In a recent display in his studio, Mr Kapoor's artworks seemed to have no shape or contours. A circle of Vantablack on the floor could be a rug-like coating or a bottomless hole; a bowl shape could be convex or concave. There was no way of telling.
During the Renaissance, artists saw that paint could be used to portray objects in three dimensions. Vantablack seems to remove the object altogether. Speaking to Artforum, a magazine, Mr Kapoor once said: ""Imagine walking into a room where you literally have no sense of the walls-where the walls are or that there are any walls at all. It's not an empty dark room, but a space full of darkness."" For the viewer, as for the artist, these works are another step in the quest for the meaning of black. *"

Callaway Arts & Entertainment; 822 pages; $22,000
It took Michelangelo four years to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, but most visitors spend less than 30 minutes gawking at it, often while pressed against umpteen strangers. These are hardly ideal conditions for beholding artistic genius, and the pandemic has curbed most discretionary travel, anyway. Now, for a mere $22,000, it is possible to commune with these Renaissance frescoes in the comfort of your own home.
This month the Vatican, together with Scripta Maneant, an Italian art publisher, and Callaway Arts & Entertainment, a publisher in New York, have released ""The Sistine Chapel"", a three-volume set that documents every painted inch of this vaulted room. Each page stitches together hundreds of tiny high-resolution photos, taken over months by photographers perched on 33-foot-tall scaffoldings. The results reveal every daub of paint and every hairline crack in plaster. The one-to-one visuals capture the arm's-length perspective Michelangelo had while painting it.
But $22,000? Some of the proceeds will go towards the Vatican Museums' conservation efforts, says Nicholas Callaway of Callaway Arts & Entertainment. Much of the fee covers the costs of producing these books. The 600 English-language editions are all bound in silk and white calf leather, and apparently only one bookbinder in the world-in Novara, Italy-can hand-sew something this size. The sets are rare, too, as the Vatican has allowed only 1,999 copies to be made (in a decree both strict and mysterious, true to form). The 1,000 in Italian have already sold out.
Eager for a glimpse, your correspondent ?? arranged to borrow a set for several days. Each volume weighs 11 kilograms, so it took two people to haul the set in its protective case up the stairs. Simply removing a book from its foam nest is an undertaking. But they are, indeed, remarkable.
Without the overwhelming drama of the chapel, it is easier to notice the gracefully bent legs of a man on his back, his nostrils facing the viewer, in the pendentive ""The Brazen Serpent"". In ""The Creation of Adam"", you can appreciate the fleshy curve of Adam's lower stomach. Every page also reveals the web of cracks cast by time, making the value of this archive plain.
But for all the pleasures of doting on individual panels from this extraordinary room, the effect can be disorienting. Paging through these immersive reproductions, the reader gets little sense for how they fit together. It is easy to imagine a more user-friendly digital experience that allows viewers to zoom in and out without worrying about the cleanliness of their hands. Depending on demand, Mr Callaway anticipates other editions, interactive and print-based, at more affordable prices.
In the meantime, the coronavirus may boost sales of the luxury sets, reckons James Daunt, head of Barnes & Noble and Waterstones, whose stores are selling these books online. Most rich people, he explains, have not got poorer during the pandemic, and many want something nice to look at during their hours at home. *"

The way the second world war is remembered-and used-is always changing. In Britain, the Blitz is invoked in every new crisis. In America, the attack on Pearl Harbour resonated anew after 9/11. Yet, as Rana Mitter of Oxford University shows in ""China's Good War"", nowhere have successive generations thought more differently about the conflict than in China, where it is seen through the prism of the Japanese invasion that began in 1931.
In his previous book Mr Mitter chronicled the bloody struggle between Japan and China that erupted into full-scale war in 1937. Now he focuses on the afterlife of those events in films, monuments, parades and propaganda. The Communist Party, he writes, has been striving to convince domestic and global audiences that Japanese atrocities, especially the Nanjing massacre, should rank among the era's worst abominations. Gallingly for many Chinese, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki often seems to command more sympathy than the suffering inflicted on them.
This push, Mr Mitter notes, represents a break from the rule of Mao Zedong, when ""official China spoke in a minor key about the war years"", stressing their role in bringing the party to power. In the past, Nationalist officials and spies, or American soldiers in Korea, were often the villains in Chinese films, as Nazis were in Hollywood productions. Heroic Chinese Communists repelling Japanese marauders always featured as well, but recently the balance has altered. China has been saturated with images of Japanese aggression; the lengths to which movies go to demonise Japanese invaders and heroise Chinese fighters are as striking as their volume. In ""Designation Forever"" (2011-), a television series, a Chinese soldier brings down a Japanese plane by throwing a grenade at it.
These observations are not new, though the range of evidence that Mr Mitter marshals is impressive. The argument he makes about war, memory and the international order is more original. The post-Mao changes, he writes, are part of a broader move from an emphasis on revolutionary ideals and class struggle to one on foreign mistreatment of China during a ""century of humiliation"" that began with the Opium wars and peaked in Japanese imperialism. Recent portrayals of the war complement a softening of official hostility towards the Nationalists, whose soldiers and even leader, Chiang Kai-shek, are now given some credit for helping defeat Japan. They fit, too, with a shift from Mao's dream of prying Tokyo away from Washington's embrace toward a more combative approach to Japan as a regional rival.
Finally, and most intriguingly, all this fits with a switch from rejecting the postwar global system, as Mao sometimes did, to using the country's status among the wartime Allies to forge a ""morally weighted narrative about China's role in the global order"". President Xi Jinping's tightening of controls over peripheral territories, and Beijing's expansion into the South China Sea, can seem imperialistic. But China's rulers want all that to be interpreted in a radically different light. According to Mr Mitter, China wishes to be seen as incorporating itself into the ""existing, largely liberal order"", while striving to ""revise that order to match its own preferences"".
Joining the World Trade Organisation, hosting the Olympics and becoming more involved in the United Nations all further this aim. So does telling war stories that show Chinese forces contributing to the defeat of the Axis powers-thereby earning China a place at the table at which the postwar order was created. *"

By Joseph Henrich. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 704 pages; $35. Allen Lane; £30
It takes more than a decent constitution to build a democracy, as anyone who has tried to steer a country out of anarchy or tyranny can attest. And it takes more than well-turned commercial laws to make a healthy market economy. For either to happen, certain values must be widely accepted-yet defining them can be tricky.
Joseph Henrich, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard, has devised a teasing term to describe societies where rules and values have come together with benign results: Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic. The acronym, weird, neatly makes his point that these attributes, and the mindset that goes with them, are the exception not the rule in human history.
The values that underpin WEiRDness, he writes, include a tough-minded belief in the rule of the law, even at the risk of personal disadvantage; an openness to experimentation in matters of scientific knowledge or social arrangements; and a willingness to trust strangers, from politicians offering new policies to potential business partners. These may not seem original insights, but Mr Henrich's work is distinguished by the weight he places on the extended family as an obstacle to healthy individualism, and on religious 1 norms as the determinant of family obligations. He reinforces this theme with a welter of polling data and sweeping historical arguments, mostly about medieval Europe.
As an example of kin loyalty at odds with modern thinking, Mr Henrich records the experience of democracy-builders in Afghanistan: rural folk could not grasp the idea that they might vote for somebody who was not part of their family. Just as foreign to such outlooks, he says, is the idea that crimes are treated equally regardless of the relationships involved. In medieval China, killing within the family was treated differently from killing a stranger; killing your father was a worse crime than killing a child.
In many accounts of modern history, it was Europe's Protestant Reformation that catalysed a more individualist, law-based mentality. Mr Henrich's own emphasis is on the Catholic world from about 1000 onwards. He thinks that, by banning kin-marriage, the Roman church ushered in a more fluid society where people had to look farther afield for spouses.
Here he is not quite convincing, despite the extensive studies he adduces to argue that modern mentalities, even now, are correlated with regions of historic Catholic influence. It seems more likely that the medieval church was negotiating with, rather than moulding, a social reality which was evolving fast as cities emerged. Nor does a ban on marrying cousins imply free marital choice. It can be part of an elaborate system of communally arranged unions.
Mr Henrich's broad point about the values that underpin liberal democracy is stronger, with one big qualification. Hundreds of millions of people live neither in atomistic WEiRD-land nor in kin-obsessed pre-modern societies, but in an interesting limbo, sometimes dynamically and sometimes tragically. Think, say, of a family from a poor, remote part of south-eastern Europe, whose younger members are working and raising children in assorted European cities, while their elders keep the home fires burning in the village. An extraordinary range of roles and attitudes coexist in three generations.
Or take the South Asian communities in some northern English towns, where the mores of rural Kashmir can persist even in the fourth generation of diaspora life. Tradition-bound as they are, such communities are not untouched by modern British culture. Younger generations grow up somewhere between Mr Henrich's weirdness and the harsh security of a regulated rural clan. Some have fun negotiating this terrain, some swing sharply towards either individualism or conformity; a handful react to the confusion by embracing extremism. In any case, WEiRDness need not be an either-or category, whether in medieval Europe or the 21st century. *"

By Martin Amis. Knopf; 560 pages; $28.95. Jonathan Cape; £20
Already the author of four darkly satirical and precociously stylish novels, Martin Amis secured his status as one of Britain's greatest living writers with ""Money (published in 1984), which followed a depraved narcissist called John Self around the streets of London and New York. In ""Experience (2000), Mr Amis turned to memoir, recounting the extraordinary childhood he spent in the care of a father and stepmother who were both eccentric authors. His latest book, ""Inside Story: How to Write, combines the two forms.
It is a novel, but its main character is called Martin Amis, and the events that make up the story recapitulate those of Mr Amis's own life, from a devastating house fire to his long friendship with the late journalist Christopher Hitchens. He even incorporates his five children (though their names are changed). Messy as they are, Mr Amis quips, lives are far more difficult to write than fiction, and in narrating his own he skips freely between decades, telling the ""inside story of his rise and 50year career.
The account of a youthful love affair in the 1970s harks back to his debut, ""The Rachel Papers (1973), albeit now the episode has much darker undertones. Later Mr Amis reflects on the deaths of his father, Kingsley Amis, his mentor, Saul Bellow, and, most crushingly, Hitchens, whose final months with cancer are revisited in excruciating detail. Death looms over ""Inside Story: now 71, Mr Amis observes that it ""is almost certainly my last long novel. The elegiac passages are often moving-where other writers might flounder in a mire of sentimentality, Mr Amis writes about illness with gravity and grace.
These narrative sections are broken up by short intermissions in which he takes on his subtitle, ""How to Write, reflecting on his craft and offering advice. Some of his points are peevish-""'myself' is just a crap word-but most, such as a warning against repeating affixes, will prove useful for regular writers of English, from office workers to novelists. And though Mr Amis, set in his ways after dozens of books, can seem a little curmudgeonly, he ends his lessons on a heartening note. Good writing, he says, ""is achievable by anyone willing to put in the time.
With each sumptuous sentence he proves his credentials as both an instructor and a worthwhile subject for the kind of autobiographical fiction that is now in vogue. For fans of his work, ""Inside Story is a victory lap; newcomers will be steered towards his rich back catalogue. *

VILFREDO PARETO, a 19th-century economist, famously observed in 1896 that 20% of the people in Italy held 80% of the wealth. Pareto's law has been found to apply to countless social and natural phenomena. Covid-19 is no exception. Just as economists use the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality, epidemiologists use a dispersion parameter, к, to measure the spread of infections caused by infectious individuals. When к is zero one individual causes all subsequent infections; as it rises so do the number of infectors.
While many people worry about the reproduction number, Ro-the average number of infections caused by an infectious individual-experts think the dispersion figure matters, too. Research published recently in Science attempts to estimate it more accurately. The paper, by Ramanan Laxminarayan of Princeton University and eight co-authors, gleaned information from test and tracing in two Indian states. The academics used data from 84,965 infected individuals and 575,071 of their known contacts-all of whom were subsequently tested for covid-19.
The study finds that covid-19 transmission is highly concentrated. Of all the contacts traced, 7.5% subsequently tested positive for covid-19 (assumed to be caused by exposure to the infected person identified). Yet the academics find that these infections stem from a minority of originally infectious individuals. Fully 71% of infected people did not transmit the virus on. Most new transmissions were from a few ""super-spreaders"": about 10% of the people caused 60% of new infections, giving covid to three other people, on average.
The к-factor does however depend on how people interact. Early on, studies found a к close to zero, as a few highly contagious individuals had ample opportunity to spread the disease. As social distancing is enacted to curb outbreaks, the dispersion parameter tends to increase. This new study, in line with others from Hong Kong and China, finds that к among all 85,000 infectors is around 0.5.
The authors' treasure trove of data gives clues to how those infections happen. Risk of infection is greatest in private homes and among similarly aged people. That is corroborated by evidence from 1,600 covid-19 ""super-spreading"" events. Such transmission occurs most often in large buildings, while just three documented events have taken place outdoors. *"

In October 1962, just as the world watched America's handsome young president go head to head with the Soviets over their missiles on Cuba, another 20th-century hero made his first on-screen appearance. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, described him as English, with a slim build, blue-grey eyes, a cruel mouth and short black hair, a comma of which rested on his forehead. The man the world came to know as Bond when ""Dr No"" was released that month was a hulking Scot with dark eyes and so little hair he had to wear a toupée. But the two men had more in common than one might think, and it was their differences as much as their similarities that combined to make him the Bondest of Bonds.
The first glimpse of him is from behind. The camera pans around the gaming table at Les Ambassadeurs in London, pausing briefly to take in Sylvia Trench's red-chiffonned bosom before turning at last to the saturnine face with its feline eyebrow, its sultry lips. He is sitting down, so you don't see the way the manly tailoring emphasises how he dresses to the left or how, when clothed in nothing but a towel, his pelty chest fills a doorway. But the message is clear. Sean Connery as James Bond simply is British manhood: good-mannered, patriotic, entitled.
Both went to Fettes College in Edinburgh, Mr Bond after he was reputedly expelled from Eton, Mr Connery to deliver milk from a barrow. He grew up in Fountainbridge, which used to be known as Foulbridge for the open sewer that ran through it. Although the sewer was eventually culverted, a stench remained, thanks to the toffee factory, the brewery and the rubber mill where his father worked 12 hours a day. By 1930, when he was born, it was one of the worst tenement slums in Edinburgh, with outside toilets and no hot water. The only bath in the street belonged to the brewery. Half a century later, whenever he stayed in a posh hotel he liked to luxuriate every day in a long hot soak.
He didn't think of it as a tough childhood, but it left its mark in several ways. His mother may have taken command of his father's wages every week, but that did not make her his equal. Even as attitudes were changing in the 1960s, Mr Connery expected women to understand that, and if they refused-if a woman was ""a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually"", he famously told Playboy in 1965-then he was entitled to slap them. His first wife, Diane Cilento, said he abused her physically and psychologically for all of their decade-long marriage, which ended in 1973.
Delivering milk was only the first job he tried. By the time he was 13, he couldn't see the point of staying on at school. There was a war on and he wanted to earn money and play football. So he signed up, first as a bricklayer and then as a lifeguard before he learned French polishing from a coffin-maker. He hoped, for a while, that he might become a professional footballer, but plumped for acting when a friend pointed out that, as a career, it had a longer shelf life.
Not long after he finished touring provincial theatres as part of the chorus for ""South Pacific"", during which he did bodybuilding to keep in shape, a friend suggested he try out for a low-budget film whose producers were looking to sign up a cheap unknown rather than an established name. Fleming was unsure about the heavy Scots burr and the lumber jacket he wore to the interview, emphasising that what was needed was Commander Bond and not an overgrown stuntman. But the producer's wife liked his barely concealed menace. He played Bond in six more films.
With his second wife, Micheline Roquebrune, he settled in the Bahamas. He liked the low tax rate. He played golf and made up for his lack of schooling by reading-literature, politics and history, especially about how the English oppressed the Scots. Even after decades of the classless, moneyed world of international cinema, he retained much of what his childhood had taught him about being born on the wrong side of the tracks.
Perhaps because he was away from it for so long, his devotion to Scotland was intense. In 1967 he released ""The Bowler and the Bunnet"", the only film he ever directed, about turbulent industrial relations in a shipyard on the Clyde in which the managers wore bowler hats and the workmen ""bunnets"" or cloth caps. A staunch nationalist, he campaigned for the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh and spoke up for Scottish independence-literally, in a party political broadcast for the Scottish National Party. Not for nothing did he have ""Scotland Forever"" tattooed on his arm.
Untouchable
There were other film roles, some of which made far better use of his acting talents than Bond-Daniel Dravot in John Huston's ""The Man Who Would Be King"" and Jimmy Malone in ""The Untouchables"", a caper about Al Capone, which won him his only Oscar- but it was Bond that defined him. It made him rich, world famous, a real star. Five other Bonds would follow, but none was as good as him. And if at times, the association seemed to weigh on him so much that some referred to it as bondage, in his gut he understood that owning Bond the way he did amounted to a sort of Scottish coopting of an English hero, and that was sweet revenge.
Most of the time he responded to questions about it with that eyebrow. Just occasionally, he would open fire. ""In playing Bond, I had to start from scratch,"" he pointed out to an interviewer just after ""Dr No"" opened. ""Nobody knows anything about him, after all. Not even Fleming."" Bond made Connery. But, more than anyone else, Connery also made Bond. *"

It also said that Iran had more than 2,440kg of low-enriched uranium, well beyond the limit set by the nuclear deal it signed with world powers in 2015. Both developments move Iran closer to producing a bomb, an ambition it denies. Donald Trump reportedly asked his advisers for options on attacking Natanz.
America announced that it would reduce its forces in Afghanistan from 4,500 troops to 2,500 by mid-January. That will allow Mr Trump to say he has ended America's longest war, but could have dire consequences for Afghanistan's stability. Troop numbers in Iraq are also to be cut.

THE YEAR was 1976 and revolution was in the air. Punk was destroying orthodoxies in the music business. Concorde was breaking the sound barrier. The economy was going down the tubes. And Lord Hailsham, a former Conservative Lord Chancellor and old boy of Eton, Oxford and the Rifle Brigade, urged the overthrow of what he called Britain's ""elective dictatorship""- the overweening executive, whose power, in Britain's parliamentary model, was untrammelled by the checks and balances of the courts and legislature that restrict it in most democracies.
Since then, the executive-made up of ministers and the people who do things on their behalf-has been constrained in many ways. The European Union's powers have grown, and in the 1990s Tony Blair weakened the executive by strengthening other parts of government, creating a Supreme Court, starting a reform of the House of Lords, devolving power from Westminster and granting independence to the Bank of England.
Now a Conservative counter-revolution is under way, driven by radicals in and around Number 10. They believe that the executive is the expression of the will of the British people, so to limit its power is to muzzle democracy. And they complain that government is far too slow. Frustration over the difficulty of getting Brexit done has fused with an enthusiasm for Silicon Valley's mantra-move fast and break things-into a determination to speed government up.
Accordingly, they are pursuing a programme of radical reform to the British state. Brexit is the boldest step, but it is only the first. The Tory plan is to unchain the executive by limiting judicial power, pushing back against devolution and reforming the civil service. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's recently defenestrated chief adviser, was one of the architects of this transformation, but it will continue without him (see Britain section).
Plenty about Britain needs to change, but the reformers' argument and direction of travel are both wrong. First, weakening devolution will not make the union stronger, it will only undermine it. The parliaments in the union's smaller nations were created in response to a real demand for a government with which their people could identify better than they can with Westminster. Second, liberal democracy is not majoritarianism. It includes checks and balances on executive power designed both to protect the rights of individuals and minorities, and to promote good governance. None of the reformers, it is worth noting, advocates removing the Bank of England's independence. That's because of the wealth of evidence showing that constraining politicians' power over monetary policy leads to better economic management.
If evidence were needed against the unshackling of the executive, covid-19 has provided it. At the beginning of the pandemic, the government arrogated to itself vast powers, unthinkable in normal times. In some areas, that has worked. Most of what the Treasury has done has been accomplished efficiently and effectively. In others, money has been wasted and chums have bagged top jobs and fat contracts. Yet the government has failed to get the job done. Look abroad, meanwhile, for evidence of the efficacy of devolution: powerful, well-resourced local authorities have been central to the effort in Germany and South Korea, two of the countries that have managed the pandemic best.
Brexit is indeed a good moment for a reset. The reformers are right to argue that the civil service needs more expertise, less churn and a powerful cohort of techies to digitise the operations of government. But their actions to undermine the political independence that gives career civil servants the confidence to say ""No, minister"" would make governance worse, not better.
The main impediment to getting things done is not the constraints on the executive but the people running it. Mr Blair was a highly effective prime minister even as he constrained the executive's power. That was because he was focused and energetic, and surrounded himself with a team of clever, hard-working ministers. Mr Johnson needs to emulate him in both of these ways, and should start by replacing incompetent ideologues with some of the talented, experienced mps who have been excluded from the cabinet just because they are not Brexiteers.
The Tories are also right to advocate constitutional reform, but their proposals would take the country in precisely the wrong direction. The biggest issue which Mr Johnson will confront next year is Scottish independence. Instead of alienating Scots-on November 16th he described devolution as a ""disaster""-he should focus on making the relationship work better. The pandemic has shown that the four parts of the United Kingdom struggle to co-operate on common problems. That job is supposed to fall to the joint ministerial committee of the four nations. It needs the power and status to act more like a real federation.
Britain should have more devolution, not less. City mayors have had a good pandemic: their popular standing ought to be matched by resources and responsibility. The balance of power between the branches of government needs to shift away from the executive, not towards it. The legislature should have a second chamber with more credibility; that means replacing a selection process for the House of Lords that combines feudalism and cronyism with an elective one. Turning the Lords into a senate of the devolved nations and the regions would give it a useful dual role. The judges' power to prevent ministers from acting unlawfully ought to be bolstered, not constrained. Regulators with the independence to insulate business from ministerial whim need to be set up to wield some of the powers that are returning from Brussels.
L'état, c'est eux
These changes to the way the executive and the constitution work would both strengthen British democracy and improve government's ability to get things done. Restoring the elective dictatorship of half a century ago would not.
Concorde, the most memorable relic of 1976, was a thing of beauty, but it was also a commercial disaster that used up huge quantities of taxpayers' money with virtually no oversight-just the thing for a prime minister with a taste for untrammelled power and grands projets. Mr Johnson would have loved it."

Accepting a disappointing election result is a vital part of a healthy democracy
Almost two weeks after the votes that made him a one-term president were counted, Donald Trump is still claiming that he won. In reality there is no room for doubt. Joe Biden beat him by almost 6m votes, amassing 306 electoral-college votes to Mr Trump's 232. Yet reality is a stranger to Mr Trump, who was crying fraud before the first vote had been cast. He has since fired an official who contradicted his view that the election was stolen and encouraged his supporters to protest against the result.
Most Republican leaders go along with the president. They include his attorney-general, Bill Barr, who told prosecutors to investigate ""substantial allegations"" of election fraud; Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who has championed the president's right to go to court; and Lindsey Graham, one of Mr Trump's staunchest Senate defenders, who Georgia's secretary of state says pressed him to exclude legitimate ballots.
As so often in the Trump presidency, it is hard to know how seriously to take all this. No coup is under way in America. Mr Trump does indeed have the right to mount legal challenges. The counting and certifying of election results has withstood pressure from above. Most of the Trump campaign's lawsuits have already been dropped or tossed out by the courts. Mr Barr's prosecutors explained that they could find no evidence of the kind of systematic fraud that the president insists took place. Despite violent threats, Georgia's secretary of state refused to buckle (see United States section).
Whatever he says or does, Mr Trump will be out on January 20th and Mr Biden will be inaugurated. Might ignoring him thus be the best strategy? Some wonder if it might be best to let the courts explain to forlorn Trump voters that their man lost.
Yet Republican conduct is expedience dressed up as principle. Lawmakers are cowed by the threat that Mr Trump might back a primary challenge against anyone he judges disloyal. They think they need Mr Trump's support to win two run-off races in early January in which control of the Senate is at stake. Worse, their indulgence of Mr Trump imposes a cost on America. The effect of Republican leaders agreeing that perhaps Mr Trump really did win damages America's ability to govern itself.
All Americans should wish the incoming administration to be competent. By delaying the transition, which in America's spoils system entails the appointment of 4,000 new officials- all of whom must receive clearances before getting to grips with their new posts-Mr Trump is making that harder. When George W. Bush handed over to Barack Obama, they held a joint session of cabinet where outgoing officials sat with their replacements and ran through a series of hypothetical crises. The Biden officials will come into office with several existing crises to handle, including the logistics of a vaccination programme for covid-19 in which lives are at stake.
The president and his apologists are doing harm in another way, too. Voters have elected a divided government in Washington, with Democrats controlling the House and the presidency and Republicans favourites to keep the Senate. This requires both parties to work together, finding common interests where they can. If most Trump voters, encouraged by the likes of Mr McConnell, have come to believe that Mr Biden's win is illegitimate, why should they want their representatives to work with him?
America has had bitter elections before, yet the electoral system has almost always generated loser's consent. In 2000 a minority of Gore supporters (36%) thought the result was illegitimate; in 2016, 23% of Clinton voters thought so. In 2020, 88% of Trump voters currently think the result was illegitimate. It is up to their elected officials to explain why it was not. This requires more than waiting for the courts, local election officials-or anyone else-to speak up. Failure to do so does not just make America harder to govern. It betrays a contempt for the spirit of democracy and thus a lack of patriotism. *"

America risks handing Afghanistan to the Taliban
Back in February President Donald Trump achieved what ought to be one of his enduring foreign-policy successes. In Doha, the capital of Qatar, bearded Taliban, some of whom had never previously allowed themselves to be photographed, accepted a peace deal with American envoys. America would withdraw its troops. In exchange, the Taliban agreed to cease attacks on foreign troops and to renounce terrorism. They also agreed to take part in further talks in Doha with the internationally recognised government in Kabul. For the first time in four decades, the deal held out the prospect of peace for Afghanistan.
Since then, America has kept its side of the bargain. The number of troops in Afghanistan has fallen from almost 10,000 to less than half that now. The Taliban have been less consistent. They have ceased attacks on American troops, but on the battlefield they continue to press their advantage. October was the bloodiest month in over a year for civilians, partly because of a Taliban attempt to take control of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. That was repelled by American air strikes. In the past few weeks the militants have seized several more rural districts. They seem to see the talks in Doha as a chance for the government in Kabul to surrender, rather than as a serious negotiation.
Mr Trump was right-and brave-to talk to the Taliban. 1 ? Though they do not hold a single city, they are unchallenged in the countryside and have a grip on the roads, on which they raise taxes rather efficiently (see Asia section). The government in Kabul, by contrast, is riddled with corruption and infighting. The militants will not be defeated, so they will have to be negotiated with. The deal struck by America's envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, was a necessary step towards ending the war.
Yet in his actions now, Mr Trump risks giving the militants far more than they would otherwise be able to claim. In the run-up to the American election, the president promised to bring all American troops home ""by Christmas"". On November 9th, after losing the election, he followed up by dismissing Mark Esper, his defence secretary, as well as several other Pentagon officials. The acting defence secretary, Christopher Miller, seems keener to satisfy his boss's demands. On November 17th he announced plans to reduce troop levels from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January.
That will let Mr Trump say he has kept his promise, but it signals to the Taliban that America is leaving no matter what. It undermines the talks in Doha and heightens the risk that the Afghan army will collapse. Already deprived of much American air support, its forces are deeply demoralised. In the attack on Lashkar Gah hundreds fled without firing a shot. More defeats could lead to much of America's expensive gear falling into the hands of the enemy, who would use it to press on farther. Plenty already has: the Taliban show off Humvees in videos shared on social media. Instead of making peace, America would have surrendered. Afghanistan might once again become a rogue state and, one day, a terrorist haven.
Joe Biden, the president-elect, will inherit this poisoned chalice. He has never been an enthusiast for intervention in Afghanistan. He, too, promises an end to ""forever wars"". As vice-president he opposed Barack Obama's ""surge"", which increased the number of troops in the country to over 100,000. But that does not mean he needs to hand victory to the Taliban.
On taking office he should announce that he will uphold the deal with the Taliban-as long as they do. It calls for American troops to leave by June of next year. Mr Biden should tell the Taliban that this is conditional on their reducing violence and taking the talks seriously. If they do not, American troops should stay. Mr Biden should also make it clear to the government in Kabul that it must negotiate in earnest.
Jens Stoltenberg, nato's secretary-general, warns that the price of leaving Afghanistan too soon ""could be very high"". By contrast, the cost of staying is low. No American soldier has been killed in combat in Afghanistan since February. A few thousand personnel is a tiny force. And yet it allows other allied countries, such as Britain and Germany, to stay and train the Afghan army. As long as some troops-and planes-remain, the Taliban's chance of seizing cities is limited. That gives the Afghan government the opportunity to negotiate a genuine peace. America should not allow the war to drag on for ever, but neither should it jeopardise all that it has fought so hard to achieve."

The G2o's new debt-relief framework is welcome. But it could still be improved on
With debts looming and dollars scarce, Zambia has wrestled in recent months with a predicament. It knew that failing to pay bondholders would be damaging. But paying only them, having failed to pay others in full, could be worse. Other creditors would ""blow off my legs"", the country's finance minister said. So on November 13th Zambia became the sixth government to default on its bonds this year-after Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, Lebanon and Suriname. Others may follow. Although financial markets have regained much of the composure they lost in March, many countries still have more debt than they can comfortably handle. Thirtyeight governments have a credit rating that denotes a ""material"" risk of default or worse, twice the number at the end of 2009.
The debts of poor countries would be less daunting if they were not such a tangle of competing claims. The 73 poorest owe almost a fifth ($i02bn) of their foreign debt to private creditors, from bondholders to banks, a similar amount to China, $76bn to other governments and the rest to multilateral lenders like the World Bank (see Finance section). And that is just the stuff that international institutions can count. Crafting equitable debt-relief deals from such a hotch-potch is difficult. Three changes in particular would help: a more joined-up approach by government lenders, tougher legislation to curb awkward private creditors, and greater use of flexible instruments that align repayment more closely with a borrower's circumstances.
Any debt debacle pits the interests of borrowers against those of lenders, but also pits lenders against each other. One creditor may be forgiving. But that allows others to free-ride on its generosity and collect payment in full. Thus every creditor wants to be sure others are doing their bit. In Zambia's case Chinese lenders (which have agreed to defer some payments) and private bondholders (which have not) blame each other for the impasse.
To make sure each of them is doing their fair share, most richcountry governments offer debt relief jointly through the Paris Club, a grouping of government lenders. America has long urged China to join. And at a summit on November 2ist-22nd, China will do the next best thing. Along with the rest of the G20 group of big economies, it will sign off on a ""common framework"" for relieving the debts of the world's 73 poorest countries, if they prove impossible to bear. The framework is limited in scope. It will apply only to countries that request help, fess up to their full liabilities, submit to iMF-style policy prescriptions and show that they cannot sustain their debts. It won't, in other words, deliver quick, unconditional debt relief to all poor countries, regardless of their need or demand for it. The framework requires all official creditors to do their share. It also obliges the borrowing country to seek similar help from private lenders.
The framework is a welcome step. The G20 should now consider some extensions. The same principles should also apply to other emerging markets, beyond the 73 poorest. The framework 1 favours reducing interest rates or delaying repayments over cutting the stock of debt. That bias should change. It typically reflects accounting conventions in creditor countries rather than any strong economic rationale. Indeed, investment and growth respond more vigorously when debts are reduced, rather than payments lightened or lengthened. And if private creditors resist doing their share and pursue full payment in the courts, G20 governments should pass additional legislation to cap the gains that vulture funds can obtain from litigation. Such laws may look like clumsy infringements on creditors' rights. But they can be justified if a creditor's prospects for a favourable legal settlement depend on debt relief provided ultimately by taxpayers.
Debt crises can spur innovation in financial instruments as well as institutions. The Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, for example, was ultimately solved only when illiquid bank loans were turned into tradable ""Brady"" bonds, named after Nicholas Brady, then America's treasury secretary. To ward off future crises, the imf and its sister organisations could help promote further innovations in the kinds of debt a country can offer.
Uncertain times have, for example, inspired new interest in bonds that automatically pay less when commodity prices tumble or natural disasters strike. Other instruments might pay out extra when gdp growth exceeds a threshold. Some of these instruments might need an independent institution to help standardise terms and referee disputes. Another idea worth exploring is ""bendy bonds"", which would let the borrower lengthen their maturity in a pinch (and defer interest payments) in return for extra interest at the end of the bond's extended life. Similar bonds already exist in the corporate-debt markets, which might make a sovereign version easier for investors to accept and price. Mr Brady's clever idea revolutionised the market for developingcountry debt. The time is ripe for another transformation. *"

To tackle inequalities, governments need to overcome qualms about collecting information on ethnicity
COVID-19 is not colour-blind. In England a black man is nearly four times more likely to die from the disease than a white man of a similar age. In the state of New York, in the first months of the pandemic, black and Hispanic children were more than twice as likely to lose a parent or caregiver to covid-19 than those who were white or Asian. Few countries publish health data filtered by race or ethnicity, but in those that do the pandemic seems to be killing more people from racial minorities.
That confirms public-health officials' worst fears. Covid-19 has laid bare countries' broad racial inequities in health and exacerbated them (see International section). The virus has also highlighted the scarcity of decent data on ethnicity or race. Most governments do not know if the pandemic is hitting particular groups harder, let alone why. In April a mere 7% of reports published in leading journals about covid-19 deaths recorded ethnicity. In western Europe most countries collect information only on people's ""migrant status (often, where parents were born), a flawed proxy.
Covid-19 should be a wake-up call. As in the debate about gender inequality, awareness of racial gaps has grown. Both suffer from too much intuitive argument and too little data. But whereas there has been something of a gender-data revolution, many remain uneasy about gathering data on ethnicity and race. Some countries, such as France, prohibit collecting such data. In Germany members of the Green party want to remove the word Rasse, a loaded term for ""race, from the constitution.
Such anxieties should not be ignored. It is no coincidence that the countries and communities, including Jews and Roma, most opposed to registering race or ethnicity have often seen how it can be used to facilitate discrimination, segregation and even genocide. More recent reminders of the harm that such information can do in the wrong hands include the war in Ethiopia (see Middle East & Africa section).
Yet these are arguments for anonymising data, not ignoring them. Race itself is not the cause of most health differences, but it is often closely correlated with policy failures, such as access to education, health care or jobs, that do cause such disparities. It is only by understanding the roots of these failings that gaps can be reduced. Data should be carefully safeguarded and their use tightly regulated. Although recognising the sensitivity of information is crucial, so is gathering and sharing it.
Inequalities and injustices can be tackled efficiently only once they become statistically visible. It was fear of inequality that led Britain, Finland and Ireland to make sure public bodies regularly gathered this data. Colombia, New Zealand and America, among the few places that collect statistics on indigenous people, use them to distribute federal funding. After Brazil started collecting data in the late 1990s by five different skin-colours, the gulf in infant mortality between indigenous and white babies became apparent. Public outrage led to serious efforts to start narrowing the gap. The Brazilian example shows that the data need to be granular. Catch-all terms such as ""bame (Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic), used in Britain, are unhelpful. ""Non-Western migrant or ""foreign born contain even less information.
The data also provide a baseline. This lets you make comparisons and monitor progress. Canada makes regional ethnicity data available, in part, so that local employers can see whether their workforce is representative.
The relationship between ethnicity and other factors, such as health or school performance, can change over time. The children of migrants are often better off than their parents were. And although the health of black Americans is still worse than that of whites, the gap is narrowing. The health of poor Americans, by contrast, remains much worse than that of rich ones and the gap is widening. So it is crucial also to have data on other characteristics, such as deprivation, education and parental income.
Collecting data is just the start. Governments must then resolve to use the information to grapple with the underlying causes of inequality in health, education or the labour market. But ignorance should not be a reason to hold back. *"

As president, Joe Biden should aim to strike a grand bargain with America's democratic allies
THE ACHIEVEMENT of the Trump administration was to recognise the authoritarian threat from China. The task of the Biden administration will be to work out what to do about it.
Donald Trump's instinct was for America to run this fight single-handed. Old allies were henchmen, not partners. As Joe Biden prepares his China strategy (see China section), he should choose a different path. America needs to strike a grand bargain with like-minded countries to pool their efforts. The obstacles to such a new alliance are great, but the benefits would be greater.
To see why, consider how the cold war against China is different from the first one. The rivalry with the Soviet Union was focused on ideology and nuclear weapons. The new battlefield today is information technology: semiconductors, data, 5G mobile networks, internet standards, artificial intelligence (ai) and quantum computing. All those things will help determine whether America or China has not just the military edge (see Science section), but also the more dynamic economy. They could even give one of the rivals an advantage in scientific research.
The first cold war created separate looking-glass worlds. The protagonists in the second are interconnected. That is partly a result of China's integration into the global economy, especially after it joined the World Trade Organisation (wto) in 2001. But it also stems from the network efficiencies of many tech businesses, which reward size and spread. And it reflects how hard it is for any one country to master the full range of specialisms in the tech economy. In chips, say, American or British designs may be made in Taiwanese plants, using Japanese and Dutch equipment with German lenses before being assembled in Chinese factories. It is no accident that autarkic North Korea can build nukes but not advanced computers.
The Chinese Communist Party has understood that tech is the path to power. China is blessed with a vast market, ambition and plenty of hard-working talent. The party is supercharging the efforts of Chinese firms with subsidies and industrial espionage. Aware of how scale matters, China is touting its technologies by securing export contracts, promoting itself as a digital power using the Belt and Road Initiative and waging a campaign of pr°China standards-setting in global bodies.
Mr Trump's abrasive solo response has had some successes. He has browbeaten some allies to stop buying gear for 5G networks from Huawei, a Chinese firm. And by threatening sanctions on chipmakers who supply Huawei, he has damaged it.
But in the long run this approach favours China. It has already accelerated China's efforts to create its own world-class chip industry-though that could easily take a decade or more. More important, if a bullying America always focuses solely on its own narrow interests, it will drive away the very allies that can help it stay ahead in tech. Europe is increasingly unwilling to leave itself open to American pressure. The European Union's highest court has twice restricted the transfer of data to America, where they may be picked over by the intelligence agencies. And European policymakers have announced plans to impose rules on the cloud, to impose digital taxes on American tech giants and to limit foreign takeovers-including, potentially, American ones.
A grand bargain would turn that conflict with Europe into collaboration (see Briefing). Rather than be consumed by squabbles, the allies could share an approach to issues like taxation, takeover rules and supply chains. For example, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (gdpr) is on the way to becoming a de facto standard outside Europe. With closer collaboration in intelligence, the alliance could be more alert to security threats from Chinese hackers and tech firms. By co-ordinating their efforts on critical technologies, they could specialise rather than duplicate research. By diversifying supply chains and vetting each link they can protect themselves from accidental or malevolent disruptions. By working together on technical standards such as OpenRAN, which uses mostly off-the-shelf hardware for 5G networks, they can create a favourable environment for their own companies. Crucially, by collaborating on ethical norms over, say, facial recognition, they can protect their societies.
Instead of leaving America isolated, a grand bargain would help it keep ahead in the race for tech dominance by bringing it the gains of closer co-operation with like-minded countries. The whole alliance would be boosted by the tech industry's formidable network effects. A bargain would also leave America more open to cross-border scientific collaboration and immigration, vital for a place that thrives on the contributions of foreign students, many of whom stay on to carry out research or work in tech. Such openness is a strength that China lacks.
Some people argue that co-operation of this sort needs a treaty, an institution like nato or the wto. But that would take a long time to set up. What it would possess in gravitas it would lack in flexibility. A grouping like an enlarged G7 would be more adaptable and less clumsy.
Either way, striking a grand bargain will be hard. For one thing, America would need to acknowledge that it is not as dominant as it was when it set up global governance after the second world war. It would have to be willing to make concessions to its allies right now-over privacy, taxation and some details of industrial policy, say-in order to protect its system of government in the long term. For the strategy to be credible abroad, there would need to be bipartisan consensus in Washington.
America's allies would have to make concessions, too. They would have to trust a country which, under Mr Trump, has sometimes looked on the transatlantic alliance with contempt. Some Europeans would have to temper their dream of becoming a superpower that stands apart from both China and America.
Yet that European dream has always looked far-fetched. And if anything can overcome divisions in Washington, China can. Moreover, the sacrifices would be worth it. A grand bargain would help focus competition with China on tech, potentially enabling detente in areas where collaboration is essential, such as curbing global warming, health and, as with the Soviet Union, arms control. A grand bargain could make the world safer by making it more predictable. When superpowers are set on a collision course, that is something profoundly to be wished for. *"

Joe Biden has won 306 electoral-college votes, including the ""Republican states"" of Arizona and Georgia. He has taken back the blue-wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also won the national popular vote, probably by a margin of five percentage points. All this while running against an incumbent president and all the advantages that conveys, and the substantial bias towards Republicans in the electoral college.
The narrative that this was a close election is a false one (""When every vote counts"", November 7th). It arose from the order in which votes were counted-Florida was an early win for Donald Trump-and the inevitable delays in counting record numbers of postal ballots, most of which came from Democrats. True, it was not the landslide predicted by many pollsters, who have clearly failed in consecutive election cycles, but it is an enormous victory for Mr Biden and the coalition he has built, and a repudiation of Mr Trump.
EAMON GLACKIN
New York
Many of us who voted for Mr Trump in 2016 did so reluctantly. Not so in 2020. The further drift to the left of the Democrats was part of it, with their idiotic identity politics. But then so was the Russia-hoax investigation, the ridiculous impeachment proceedings and the unfathomable hatred spewed towards our president. We saw President Trump as someone who got things done, using a wrecking ball when dealing with stagnant bureaucracies. We saw the Iran deal as appeasement, the Paris accord as wealth redistribution doing little to tackle climate issues, the relocation of our embassy to Jerusalem as a law at last implemented, and pushing our European partners to pay their fair share for their own defence as long overdue.
We saw many more accomplishments during his tenure, where you and others saw nothing good. This election was close. That is because the Democrats never came to terms with Mr Trump's victory in 2016. They would have done better if they had tried to understand why they lost then and changed direction.
RUTH BERNER
Swannanoa, North Carolina
Much of the media's coverage of the election focused on how divided the country is, but Americans are not as polarised as they may appear. Most voted pragmatically, to remove the inept Mr Trump, and ensure that Mr Biden, or perhaps more accurately, his left flank, lacks a clear path to pass a sweeping liberal agenda in Congress. This election had a high turnout, upwards of 155m people. Most of those votes did not come from the fringe, they came from the centre.

In 1878 William Gladstone declared that the American constitution ""is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man."" I find it puzzling that you refer to this wonderful work as ""rickety"" (""Spell unbroken"", November 7th). Divided government has served the United States well and yielded prosperity. Think of the eras of Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, Barack Obama and Mitch McConnell.

I am, I hope, a reasonably sophisticated reader of opinion polls, and chaired the House of Lords select committee on the subject, which reported in 2018. No doubt the American Association for Public Opinion Research will do the thorough job of investigating this miss as they did after Hillary Clinton's defeat, just as Professor Patrick Sturgis and his team did after the British polls got the election in 2015 so wrong. Like you (""Whiffing twice"", November 7th) I think the most likely explanation is that the voters who refused to reply to pollsters-11in 12 according to some estimates-are not typical of voters as a whole. That proportion of refuseniks has grown, and is growing.
Opinion polls have their uses, particularly on social matters when small differences in the precise numbers don't matter. In elections however, small differences can matter very much indeed. A tool is not a good tool if it is used for a purpose, in this case forecasting election results, for which it is not really fit.

The attempted coup in Turkey
""Voltaire's heirs"" (November 7th) stated that thousands of Muslims in Turkey were locked up ""for belonging to the wrong religious group"". That is incorrect. The people in question were jailed for trying to stage a military coup in Turkey in July 2016 that caused the loss of life of more than 250 people while bombing cities, and the Turkish Parliament, with fighter jets. Describing them as the ""wrong religious group"" does nothing to contribute towards protecting the freedoms of speech and belief.

Thailand's politics
When reporting on Thailand's monarchy the media should avoid cherry-picking anecdotes to fit certain narratives (""Battle royal"", October 17th). The Crown Property Bureau has dedicated large sums of investment for public benefits. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has asked the cpb to consider using its land for constructing water reservoirs to solve a water scarcity problem. Siam Bioscience, an investment of the cpb to improve patients' access to high quality medicine, is co-operating with AstraZeneca to develop a covid-19 vaccine for Thailand and South-East Asia.
Although the monarchy is regarded in high esteem, it has often been inappropriately politicised by opposing factions, particularly when tension arises. The recent protests and suggestions for political reform reflect the reality of the conflict between people of different viewpoints in our society, which has been exacerbated by the increase of hate speech circulated both in mainstream and social media. As such, structural changes can only be achieved through open dialogue and not further divisiveness and violence.

The provenance of a proverb
The phrase, ""like two bald men fighting over a comb"", has a longer history than the border skirmish in 1998 between Ethiopia and Eritrea (""Ethiopia is poised to unravel"", November 7th). It is often quoted as if it is a new witticism. In fact, Jorge Luis Borges used it in reference to the Falklands war in 1982, and it stretches back further in time than that, possibly all the way to Phaedrus, a writer in ancient Rome. Borges, however, may have been the first to use it as a metaphor for futile war.

Without teaming up, democracies will not be able to establish a robust alternative to China's autocratic technosphere
America has long dominated the world in information technology (it) . Its government, universities and enterprising spirit have provided it with decades of leadership in hardware and software. Its military drones, satellites and ""system of systems"" give its armed forces a powerful edge over those of any competitor. Silicon Valley is more visited by foreign dignitaries and finders-of-fact than any other business locale in the world. One of its tech giants is currently worth over $2trn; three more are worth over $itrn. The contribution technology makes to the buoyancy of its markets is without equal.
China, too, has digital resources in abundance, not least its huge population of 1.4.bn, which means it will eventually boast an even deeper pool of data and experts to develop ai models. The country's digital giants, from Alibaba to Tencent, have already become ai and cloud-computing powers in their own right. Its people live online to an extent that Americans-many of whom still have cheque books-do not. The country's Great Firewall keeps undesirable digital content out. Within the wall, tech firms are allowed to fight it out as long as they are happy helpers of China's surveillance state.
And China is on the move. It is investing billions in emerging technologies, from ai and chip fabrication to quantum computing and sg, a new generation of mobile networks. It is hacking other countries' computer systems and grabbing intellectual property where it can. It is packing the organisations that develop global technical rules, such as the International Telecommunication Union. And it is pulling other countries into its orbit with initiatives such as the ""digital Silk Road"", helping them build out their digital infrastructure.
President Donald Trump saw, correctly, that this made China a serious challenger to America's digital supremacy. His humbling of Huawei, a Chinese telecomsequipment maker, has begun a decoupling of Chinese and American it infrastructures and of the supply chains between China and America that will continue.
Many device-makers have already moved part of their production out of China and some will end up with two separate supply chains. Apple's contract manufacturers, for instance, are setting up plants in India. tsmc, a Taiwanese chip firm, announced in May that it will build a facility in Arizona. Feeling its dependence on American semiconductor technology, China is doubling down on efforts to build its own. In software and other areas, too, bifurcation has begun-and not just because of bans against Chinese apps.
What Mr Trump was unable or unwilling to understand, though, was that China and America are not the only economies that matter in this contest, and that fact provides America with a potentially decisive advantage. India, the European Union, Japan and others all play crucial roles in the world's it system-as do tech giants such as Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft.
All these entities, whether national or corporate, are at odds with the American government and often with each other over something or other in the it world, whether it be visas, privacy rights or competition complaints. But they would also all prefer a world in which international agreements, practices and expectations for it embody the values and interests they share with America, rather than those of China. And if democratic countries cannot agree on common rules in the digital realm, China could end up setting the rules for large swathes of the world. The result would be a technosphere engineered for the comfort and support of autocracies.
A partial catalogue of the past few months' disagreements shows the fractiousness that stops the free world coming together on this-and how many opportunities for dealmaking there would be if it decided it should. America's commerce department told foreign firms they could sell no more chips made using American technology to Huawei; its justice department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. America also pulled out of talks at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (oecd), a club of mostly rich countries, about how to tax the tech giants. India blocked dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, a popular video-sharing service, which the American government also wants to ban. The European Court of Justice (ecj) struck down the ""Privacy Shield"" agreement between America and the European Union (eu), thus throwing the legal basis on which personal data flows across the Atlantic into doubt.
Europe has been trying for some time to carve out its own space in the digital realm as a protector of the citizenry-a noble goal made easier by the fact that the companies from which its citizens are being protected are mostly based the other side of the ocean. This has heightened tensions between Brussels, Washington and Silicon Valley. The ecj's ruling on the Privacy Shield is one example. The European Commission is drafting legislation that would weaken the power of America's tech giants. Its proposed Digital Services Act would outlaw some of the firms' business practices, such as bundling their services to take over new markets or displaying them more prominently than competing ones.
We will rock you
Some of the eu's member states have also begun defending their right to rule their own digital roost, something now called ""digital sovereignty"". There is talk of creating a European cloud within the American one. gaia-x is a step down that road-a federation of clouds, launched by Germany and France in June, whose members agree to certain rules, such as allowing customers to choose where their data are stored and move freely to providers' competitors if they wish. There is more to come: a ""data strategy"" on the table in Brussels would, if fully implemented, create ""data spaces"" ruled by European law and give people more rights on how their data are used.
These disputes offer ample space for mutually beneficial trade-offs. If America and its allies can reach good enough accommodations on the most contentious issues-notably privacy and competition-and find ways to live with the smaller contradictions and conflicts which remain, they can become a force to be reckoned with-one that others will need little encouragement to join. An insular America can remain a technology superpower. A connected America cemented into the rest of the world by means of a grand technopolitical bargain could be the hub of something truly unsurpassable.
There is a range of ideas about how to do this. In a recent report for the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, Robert Knake imagines such a grand bargain taking the form of a ""digital trade zone"", complete with a treaty organisation. America would ""weaponise its digital trade relationships"" in order to promote such things as cyber-security, privacy protection and democratic values on the internet. Only countries that comply with the organisation's rules on such matters would be able to become members and only members would be allowed fully to trade with each other digitally. Violations would be dealt with by imposing sanctions and tariffs. ""If the digital trade zone grows strong enough, China might see more benefit to co-operative engagement than to continued disruptive behaviour,"" writes Mr Knake.
Others prefer to imagine something less formal, rules-based and punitive. In October three other think-tanks-the Centre for a New American Security (cnas), merics of Germany and the Asia-Pacific Initiative of Japan-outlined a less exclusive construction. They propose that democratic countries form a ""technology alliance"" not subject to a formal treaty. It would be like the G7, which consists of America, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, and could one day, perhaps, include India and other countries from the Global South. It would hold regular meetings, as the imf and World Bank do, and issue consensus opinions, and it would invite other stakeholders-from ngos to tech firms-to pitch in.
Let us cling together
Until this month, such ideas seemed premature. But with Joe Biden soon in the White House, they have become more realistic: it will be high on the agenda of the ""summit of democracies"" he has promised to convene. Closer co-ordination and some new institutions to back it up are also more needed, and not just because of the Chinese threat. The coronavirus, by pushing much of human activity into the cloud, has emphasised the importance of the digital realm and its governance. Left alone, the world of technology will continue to disintegrate into a splinternet in which digital protectionism is widespread-much as the global financial system fell apart before the second world war.
To make sense of all this, it helps to see the political world as one in which technology is beginning to look ever more like geography. The geopolitical way of looking at the world, which was born in the 19th century and revolutionised strategic thinking in the 20th, was based on the idea that the geographical aspects of the physical world could be crucially important to the relations between states. Mountains that blocked transit and plains that permitted it; oilfields and coalfields; pinch-points where maritime traffic could be constrained. Where a state's territory stood in respect to such geographical facts of life told it what it should fear and what it might aspire to, whose interests conflicted with its own and whose might align with them. In other words, geography was destiny.
The units of analysis for today's nascent technopolitics are platforms: the technologies on which other technologies are built-and alongside them, increasingly, businesses, governments and ways of life. The platform of all platforms is the internet. Some of the things which stand upon it are huge and widely known, such as Facebook, others small and obscure, such as Kubernetes, a sort of software used in cloud computing. Like geographical territories, these platforms have their own politics. They have their own populations, mostly users, coders and other firms. They have their own laws, which lay out who can change code and access data. They have a position with respect to other platforms which underpin, compete with or build on them, just as territories have defined relationships with their neighbours.
And they have their own governance systems. Some are ""open"". The most famous is Linux, an operating system created and maintained through co-operative efforts to which all are, in principle, free to contribute and from which all are welcome to benefit. Others are ""closed"", as is the convention among many corporate-software makers, such as Oracle. Some are run like absolute monarchies, such as Apple under Steve Jobs, who was the final arbiter over the smallest details in his tech empire.
Don't stop me now
Their dominant positions in this world of platforms give companies like Facebook and Google powers approaching or surpassing those of many countries. Yet countries can-as their economies become more digitised-be increasingly understood as platforms, too: national operating systems of sorts. Natural resources still count, but digital resources are gaining ever more relevance: skilled and welltrained tech workers, access to scads of data, computing power, internet bandwidth, industrial policy and venture capital. And as with technology platforms, a country's competitiveness will, to a large extent, depend on how it manages and multiplies these resources.
America is a platform like Microsoft's Windows and Android, Google's mobile operating system. These mix aspects of open and closed systems, allowing others to develop applications for their platform, but also closely control it. America combines monopolies and a strongish state with lots of competition. Mainly thanks to this profitable amalgam, the country has given rise to most of the world's leading tech firms. China is more like Apple and Oracle, which combine being closed with lots of internal competition. The European Union is best compared to an open-source project such as Linux, which needs complex rules to work. India, Japan, Britain, Taiwan and South Korea all run differently and have technology bases to match.
The rise of cloud computing and ai- the first a truly global infrastructure, the second its most important application- has heightened the tensions between these platforms. More and more value is created by using oodles of computing power to extract ai models from digital information generated by people, machines and sensors. The models can then be turned into all sorts of services. Transport, health care, teaching, campaigning, warfare-these parts of society will not become ""data-driven"" as fast as many predict, but in time they will all be transformed. Whoever controls the digital flows involved can divert much of the rent they generate. Knowledge is power in the virtual world even more than in the real one-and it generates profit. Ian Hogarth, a British tech thinker, summarised the sudden sense of urgency when he wrote in a paper in 2018 that ""ai policy will become the single most important area of government policy"".
Many rich countries have drawn up ambitious industrial-policy plans for ai. Some have also instituted national data strategies which limit the data that can leave the country. A few have begun attacking other countries' platforms by hacking their computer systems and spreading misinformation. In short, they are behaving increasingly like the companies producing the technology reshaping their world. ""Everybody has become much more technonationalist,"" says Justin Sherman of the Atlantic Council, a think-tank.
That the 21st-century internet would be a splinternet was, perhaps, inevitable. It is not just that nations act in their own interests; they also have different preferences and values, for instance regarding privacy. High digital borders behind which data get stuck, however, are not in the interests of most countries-though they may be in the interest of some governments. Russia wants to create a ""sovereign internet"" that can be cut from the rest of the online world at the flip of a switch (while retaining the capability to mess around in more open systems). Countries interested in using flows of data to improve their citizens' lot, though, will see few advantages. In a splinternet world choice will be limited, costs will rise and innovation will slow. And all the while China, with the biggest silo and thus the greatest access to data, loses least.
You're my best friend
It is against this background that a grand bargain needs to be struck. Its broad outline would be for America to get security guarantees and rule-making bodies in which its interests can be taken seriously. In return it would recognise European privacy and other regulatory concerns as well as demands that tech titans be properly taxed. Ideally, such a deal would also include India and other developing countries, which want to make sure that they do not risk becoming mere sources of raw data, while having to pay for the digital intelligence produced.
In terms of security, the parties to the bargain would ensure each other secure, diverse supply chains for digital infrastructure. To get there, the cnas proposes, in effect, to partially mutualise them: among other things, members of a tech alliance should co-ordinate their efforts to restructure supply chains and might set up a semiconductor consortium with facilities around the world. Supporting open technologies and standards that create a diverse set of suppliers would help, too. An example is OpenRAN, a mobile network that allows carriers to mix and match components rather than having to buy from one vendor. A world with open infrastructure like this need not, in principle, just depend on a few suppliers, as is the case today with Huawei, Nokia or Ericsson.
To give in to Europe on other fronts in return for help in such matters would be costly to America, which has largely opposed attempts to regulate and tax its tech giants abroad. In terms of statecraft, that is an attractive part of the arrangement; to be willing to pay a cost shows that you place real value on what you are getting.
If an alliance of democracies is to deliver a China-proof technosphere, America will have to accept that the interdependence of the tech world on which the whole idea is based means that it cannot act unconstrained. Henry Farrell of Johns Hopkins University argues that America has so far simply ""weaponised"" this interdependence, using chokepoints where it has le- verage to strangle enemies and put pressure on friends. But Europe's resistance to banning Huawei's gear and the ecj's decision show that even friends can balk. America needs to give if it is to receive.
It might not have to give all that much. European views on regulating platforms more strictly because of their tendency to become quasi-natural monopolies are not exactly mainstream in Washington, dc, but nor are they completely alien to the political debate there. A recent congressional report about how to limit big tech's power included many ideas already touted in Brussels, such as banning tech giants from favouring their own services and refusing to connect to competing ones. Positions on regulating speech online are not that far apart either. As in Europe, there is growing agreement in America that legislation is needed to push social-media firms to do more to rid their services of hate speech and the like.
A deal on taxing tech firms seems within reach, too. The Trump administration resisted efforts to compel them to pay taxes where they do business rather than in tax havens, regarding this as a grab for the profits of American companies. A Biden administration is likely to be more open to the argument that more of the taxes on digital firms should go to places where their customers live. Expect negotiations on the matter at the oecd to be revived-as they must be to keep countries from charging digital taxes unilaterally. Barring a compromise, France, Spain and Britain will start collecting such a levy early next year.
In parts of the world's international bureaucracy the grand bargaining has already begun. When Japan presided over the G20, a club of developing and rich countries, last year, it succeeded in getting the group to launch the ""Osaka Track"", an attempt to come up with rules to regulate global data flows. This summer also saw the launch of the Global Partnership in ai, which is meant to come up with rules for the responsible use of ai, and of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which brings together lawmakers from 18 countries. These new groups join a few established ones, such as the oecd and the Internet Governance Forum, which have long pushed for common rules in the digital realm. nato has started to do the same for ai and data-sharing among its members.
One of the key parameters in the bargaining will be how formal a framework the parties want. In some ways, formal is better: everyone knows where they stand. In others, formal is worse: agreement is harder. Take the example of trade, thoroughly formalised within the wto. Trade agreements take years to negotiate, often only to be blocked by legislatures at the last minute. This is why a Biden administration will probably aim for a much looser form of co-operation, at least initially. An idea discussed in foreign-policy circles close to Mr Biden is that, instead of agreeing on certain policies that then have to be implemented nationally, governments should opt for a division of labour within certain red lines. If Europe wants to go ahead with rules to regulate big tech which do not amount to expropriation, America would not put up a fight-thus allowing the eu regulation to become the global standard of sorts, rather as it has done with the gdpr.
The show must go on
Compromises that provide something for everyone are not hard to spot. But reaching them will not be easy. After four years of President Trump, ""the mistrust on the European side runs deep,"" says Samm Sacks of CNAS. On the other side of the Atlantic, Congress will not want to make life more difficult for its intelligence agencies, for whom social media and online services have become a crucial source of information. In order for a grand bargain to be reached, all of that must be made more difficult. If the Ecj struck down the Privacy Shield, it was mostly because the court believed that America does not provide enough safeguards to protect European data from the eyes of its intelligence and law-enforcement agencies.
Another big barrier on the way to a bargain will be the question of how much America's tech titans need to be reined in. ""To bring globe-spanning technology firms to heel, we need something new: a global alliance that puts democracy first,"" argues Marietje Schaake, a former member of the European Parliament who now works for the Cyber Policy Centre at Stanford University, in a recent article. Many in California and elsewhere in America like the sound of this, but Congress will only go so far in restricting its tech giants and their business model, which is increasingly based on extracting value from data.
Even if a grand bargain can be reached, many small ones will need to be done as well. That is why, in the long run, the world needs more than bilateral deals and a loose form of co-operation, but something more robust and specialised. It may even have to be something like a World Data Organisation, as Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group has suggested (or at least a gadd, a General Agreement on Data and Digital Infrastructure, a bit like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as the WTO's predecessor was called). Given the sorry state of the wto, this may seem fanciful, but without such an organisation today's global data flows may shrink to a trickle-much as protectionism limited trade in the days before the gatt and the wto.
Will it ever happen? Yes, if history is any guide. In July 1944 representatives of 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to hash out a new financial order, including the imf and the World Bank. Granted, the pandemic is no world war. But, with luck, living through it may provide enough motivation to try again in the digital realm. *"

The Tories have a radical plan to remake the state. Brexit is only the beginning
Britons have been gripped in recent days by a drama superior to anything Netflix has to offer. Dominic Cummings, the all-powerful adviser who masterminded Brexit and had Boris Johnson in his thrall, has been ousted by a triumvirate made up of Allegra Stratton, the prime minister's press secretary, Munira Mirza, his policy chief (who used to be a revolutionary communist-but that's another story) and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. Those who disapproved of Mr Cummings not just for his appalling manners but also for his radicalism, of whom there are many both inside and outside the Conservative Party, are hoping that Mr Johnson will revert to being the pragmatic One Nation centrist he was as mayor of London.
That is certainly the impression that the prime minister gave this week when he launched a ten-point plan to turn Britain green. But Mr Cummings's great project will roll on without him.
The plan, which has the support of the Tory party and was outlined in the 2019 manifesto, is to weaken the judicial, political and administrative limits that have been placed on the power of the executive. Brexit is only the beginning. By the time of the next election, ministers will have control over more policies, enjoy more discretion and face fewer restraints than they have for decades.
Meg Russell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, warns of ""democratic backsliding"". Charlie Falconer, the shadow attorney-general, sees Britain falling ""under a majoritarian dictatorship"". Some see parallels in America or even Hungary, yet this is a distinctly British story: a conservative counter-revolution against checks and balances to executive power built up over half a century.
In a televised lecture in 1976, Lord Hailsham, a former Lord Chancellor, called for the overthrow of Britain's ruling dictatorship. There was no junta of mustachioed generals and secret policemen; James Callaghan, the Labour prime minister, was a gentle fellow. Rather, Hailsham argued, Britain was an ""elective dictatorship"". Parliamentary sovereignty, the underpinning principle of Britain's uncodified constitution, granted the legislature the power to make and undo any law it wished, he explained. A government which commanded a majority in the House of Commons enjoyed a power absolute in theory and constrained in practice only by political realities and mps' consciences. ""Only a revolution, bloody or peacefully contrived, can put an end to the situation,"" he said.
Hailsham proposed a written constitution, inspired by those in Australia and Canada, which would curb the power of Parliament. He wanted a federal system of devolved parliaments for Britain's nations and regions, a bill of rights and an elected House of Lords. The new arrangement would be overseen by the courts. The queen would stay, of course.
Yet the regime he criticised was already being dismantled. From the 1960s, judges and legal academics responded to the everbossier post-war state by developing the doctrine of judicial review. In a series of cases, they marked out the scope for judges to overturn the decisions of ministers who had overstepped the powers Parliament gave them, failed to follow a fair process or behaved irrationally.
In 1973, Britain joined the European Economic Community. In the following decades, control of many areas of policy once dealt with in London went to Brussels. In exercising their remaining powers, ministers were constrained by European laws on state aid, procurement and the environment. Margaret Thatcher was enthusiastic, for the process limited the scope for them to mess with the economy. Brussels required the courts to strike down domestic laws and decisions that contradicted European law.
Tony Blair, who took office in 1997, thought Britain over-centralised and remote from citizens. The revolution he led looked a lot like the one Hailsham envisaged. He set up new devolved governments in London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. (An assembly later planned for north-east England was rejected in a referendum after a campaign on which Mr Cummings worked. Its slogan was ""More doctors, not politicians"".) A Supreme Court was created, independent of the legislature. A Human Rights Act, with which laws and ministers' decisions had to conform, was passed. There was more oversight and less secrecy. Thatcher had set up the National Audit Office to scrutinise government spending; Mr Blair's Freedom of Information Act created new rights of access to official papers.
David Cameron, a small-state moderniser, abolished the prime minister's power to trigger elections. He strengthened Whitehall's hand, recognising the civilservice code, which asserts officials' political impartiality, in law. He bolstered the regime of ministerial directions, under which senior civil servants can publicly caution ministers if they believe a project is undeliverable or wasteful.
Vernon Bogdanor, a constitutional historian, concluded in 2009 that Mr Blair's reforms were a classically liberal project in limited government, ""seeking to secure liberty by cutting power into pieces."" Before proposing a law, ministers had to check that it was compatible with European and human-rights legislation, as well as the devolution settlement. Ministers could expect their decisions to be scrutinised by judges, auditors and the public. The elective dictatorship had been toppled.
The Conservatives miss the ancien régime. They blame judicial review for gumming up decision-making, and humanrights law for hobbling immigration policy. The crude carve-up of policy areas between London, Edinburgh and Cardiff has, they think, left the British government too feeble to tackle crises like covid-19. Devolution was meant to save the Union but, they maintain, has only boosted separatists. On November 16th, in a moment of candour, Mr Johnson expressed this view, telling a gathering of mps he thought Scottish devolution a ""disaster"" and Mr Blair's ""biggest mistake"".
What Hailsham saw as a dictatorship, the Tories see as a bond between voters and the government. Institutions and watchdogs created during Mr Blair's tenure masquerade as independent, argues an official, but instead form a parallel political class. According to this view, Blairism weakened rather than strengthened democracy: voters are disillusioned not because Westminster is too mighty but because those they chose to run the country are constrained by people who have not been elected.
The restoration
For many Tories the prorogation debacle of 2019 confirmed that things had gone badly wrong. It was the culmination of a battle around Brexit which, said the Conservative Party manifesto in the subsequent election, ""opened up a destabilising and potentially extremely damaging rift between politicians and people"".
Mr Johnson had promised, ""do or die"", to deliver Brexit on October 31st, but without a working majority, and unable to call an election, he was blocked by Parliament. He prorogued Parliament, but the Supreme Court, which heard interventions from the Scottish and Welsh governments, blocked his move. The judges described their decision as a defence of Parliament, in keeping with the courts' role in settling constitutional questions for more than 400 years. Brexiteers saw it differently, and are determined to prevent the executive from losing control again.
In most countries, changing the constitution is hard. In Britain, it is easy. The new checks and balances were passed by Parliament, and what Parliament has created, it can take away. The reforms of the past 40 years will not be overthrown, but there will be a course-correction to assert the primacy of the politicians over judges and officials. Danny Kruger, a Tory mp, calls it ""a restoration of politics to its proper place at the apex of our common life.""
Brexit, which comes into full effect on January 1st, ends the supremacy of European law in Britain. As Mr Cummings's campaign slogan of ""take back control"" promised, both the workload and the elbow-room of ministers will expand. They will take charge of the sanctions imposed on Russian kleptocrats, the allocation of airport landing-slots and the chemical composition of toilet unblocker. David Frost, Mr Johnson's negotiator, sees Brexit as a zero-sum game in recovering lost sovereignty. Ending Europe's control over state subsidies and emissions is ""the point of the whole project.""
Parliament has passed a stack of laws to patch the hole left by Brussels in running Britain. But whereas in Brussels powers are distributed among the eu's institutions, in Britain they are concentrated in ministers' hands. mps will have less freedom to block future trade deals than their counterparts in the European Parliament or America's Congress; ministers will have wide powers to rewrite regulations on agriculture and medicines. A new environmental regulator has been set up, but campaigners think it weedier than the European Commission.
While ministers get mightier, the courts are being weakened. They will no longer be able to strike down decisions and acts incompatible with eu law. A review led by Edward Faulks, a critic of the prorogation ruling, will ask whether judicial review is being abused ""to conduct politics by another means"". It will look at placing some of the prime minister's prerogative powers, such as deploying troops or appointing ministers, beyond the reach of judges, and at ""streamlining"" the burden placed on government by disclosure rules.
Robert Buckland, the Lord Chancellor, is considering changing the Supreme Court's name to downgrade its status. A further review of how the courts apply the Human Rights Act will be launched this month. Mr Johnson wants to reclaim the power to trigger elections by repealing Mr Cameron's Fixed-term Parliaments Act.
Critics argue that this will result in worse, not better, government. If disclosure is limited, the scope for bringing unlawful behaviour to light will be too. Judicial-review cases are usually about everyday matters in which officials have administered lousily, rather than grand constitutional questions. Judges enter political terrain rarely, reluctantly and only with good reason-which, many would argue, they had in the case of the prorogation of Parliament.
Devolution is being nudged back too. Mr Johnson wants to end the impression that he is a visitor in a foreign land when he tours the United Kingdom, and to show that being in the Union pays. Brussels used to send money to Scotland and Wales to pay for film festivals, bridges and other goodies. In future London will distribute that bounty. The pandemic has also left city mayors feeling squeezed. Manchester's Andy Burnham, among others, complained about the imposition of lockdown in his city; Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, accused the government of a power grab after it threatened to take control of Transport for London, the Tube operator, during bail-out negotiations.
The Internal Market Bill, published on September 9th, is intended to create an all-UK market after Britain drops out of the eu's single market. It contains wide ""ouster"" clauses, limiting judges' scope to review how ministers use their powers and exempting them from their duty to act in accordance with the Human Rights Act. The government's legal advice justified the bill on the bald principle of parliamentary sovereignty: if lawmakers vote for it, it is constitutional.
""We are living through Hailsham's nightmare,"" says Peter Hennessy, a constitutional historian. The difference between the 1970s and today, he says, is the degree to which ministers restrain themselves to do only what they regard as right and proper: the so-called ""good chaps"" theory of government. ""The problem with this government is its alarm bells don't ring,"" he says.
The executive lacks internal checks and balances. Mr Johnson's cabinet is stuffed with timid loyalists whose aides, since a restructuring by Mr Cummings, now answer to Downing Street. The government's top lawyers-Mr Buckland, Suella Braverman, the attorney-general, and Michael Ellis, the solicitor-general-nodded through the Internal Market Bill, which broke international law, although the head of the civil service's legal department and the advocate-general for Scotland quit over it. ""If you operate a command model, you can go a long way foolishly before anyone raises a flag,"" says Lord Hennessy.
Raising flags is one of the two jobs of Britain's permanent civil service. The civil service is not merely an instrument of ministerial will, bound to deliver the policies of the elected government: it is also a soft check on ministerial whim. Civil servants are obliged to provide politically impartial advice based on rigorous evidence. Job security, the logic runs, encourages honesty.
The tension between the civil service's two jobs is of long standing. Mr Cummings's complaint that mandarins smother innovation and defend the status quo was the premise of ""Yes, Minister"", a 1980s tv comedy. But the attacks on it now are unusually fierce. Under Mr Johnson, a string of top civil servants have been shoved out. Mark Sedwill, who quit as cabinet secretary in June, told mps on November 17th that briefings to newspapers discouraged civil servants from giving ""blunt and candid"" advice.
The government wants to make the civil service more skilled and to raise the prestige of ""operational"" folk. But it also wants to make it more responsive to ministerial will. Mr Johnson has filled top jobs with political allies, including Dido Harding, the head of Britain's test-and-trace service, and Lord Frost. The number of ministerial directions has risen sharply this year (see chart on previous page), largely because of the need for speed during the pandemic. Theodore Agnew, the minister in charge of government reform, thinks ministers should be more willing to override cautious civil servants.
The main obstacle to the Internal Market Bill is now the House of Lords, which heavily amended the bill on November 9 th. ""It would be extraordinary if a measure of this kind, which whatever your view is a controversial measure, had not been questioned. They were carrying out their constitutional duty,"" says Lord Fowler, the Lords' speaker. Yet the upper house has little power: it can only delay bills, and by convention does not block the government's manifesto promises. Its credibility is undermined by a bizarre appointments system which combines tradition with patronage. Mr Johnson has shown disdain for it, filling it with pals and suggesting it move to York.
Moody blues
For 200 years, the Conservative Party has forestalled popular revolution by constitutional evolution. Ministers say that is what they are doing now, by channelling populist anger at over-mighty judges and footdragging mandarins. But there are worries about the direction of travel, not least from the government's own side.
An overweening executive does not sit comfortably with a taste for small government. Immigrants may appeal to judges to avoid deportation; so do Home Counties Tories keen to block developments. Business, too, dislikes government by ministerial whim, for investors prize the security that the rule of law offers. Those concerns have already made themselves felt. On October 16th, Moody's downgraded Britain's credit rating, blaming, in part, the country's weakened institutions and its approach to rules and norms.
Mr Cummings's goal was to deliver vast ""moonshot"" projects faster and cheaper. But government failures are often the consequence of hasty ministers listening to civil servants too little, not too much. ""There's a real problem with ministers that overpromise and under-deliver. You need checks and balances upfront,"" says Gus O'Donnell, a former cabinet secretary.
There are diplomatic costs, too. The breach of international law embodied in the Internal Market Bill was condemned not just by the Labour Party and all living former prime ministers, but also by Joe Biden, whom Mr Johnson is now desperate to impress. It also poisoned trade talks in Brussels. And how, asked Sir John Major, a former prime minister, could Britain wag the finger at Russia and China again when they flouted international norms?
Mr Johnson fought the 2019 election on the basis that ""getting Brexit done"" would heal the country's divisions. Instead, it opens new questions about where power should lie and how it should be constrained. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former human-rights barrister, is a defender of the checks, balances and mores of Mr Blair's era. Mr Johnson represents a new strain of majoritarian democracy, for whom statecraft is a simple matter of serving voters what they ordered. The battle for Brexit is over. The fight for the constitution has just begun. *"

Boris Johnson's ten-point plan will help his career more than the planet
Fifteen years ago a newly elected Conservative leader, David Cameron, set out to revive his party. He pushed social liberalism, environmentalism and a modest state, and chided the Tories for ""banging on about Europe. These days the Conservative Party is queasy about social liberalism and is all for state intervention and banging on about Europe. Of Mr Cameron's modernising project only the greenery remains. And even that has been given a Johnsonian makeover.
On November 18th Boris Johnson unfurled a ten-point plan to make Britain greener. He promised more wind turbines, to be built offshore where they do not offend voters, and more money for research into nuclear power and carbon capture and storage. By 2030 an entire town will be heated using hydrogen and new petroland diesel-driven vehicles will be banned.
It is probably not enough to get Britain to net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050-a target that became law last year. The Climate Change Committee, an independent body, told mps in the summer that the country was off-track. Electricity, industry and farming have become much greener since the 1990s, but buildings and vehicles have not (see chart).
Mr Johnson's plan to get Britons into electric vehicles is bold. Other countries will ban sales of new fossil-fuelled cars beginning in 2035 or 2040; only Norway has an earlier target than Britain. But boldness is not enough. To avoid a backlash and an embarrassing retreat, it helps to have a plan. At the moment just 6.6% of new cars sold in Britain are battery-powered and another 5.5% are plug-in hybrids-a technology that will be allowed until 2035.
The reason electric cars are unpopular is not that they are hard to charge. Nearly three-quarters of British households with cars park on their property or in a garage, so could charge them at home. Public chargers are becoming more common. Adrian Keen, the boss of Instavolt, a firm with more than 500 chargers, says that the average car now plugs in when it has 30% of a full charge remaining. Three years ago the figure was 44%. That suggests drivers are more confident that they will be able to charge when they need to.
The problem is that electric cars are much more expensive than petrol or diesel-powered ones. Even after a government grant of up to £3,000 ($4,000) per vehicle, a new electric Vauxhall Corsa costs about £26,000, compared with £16,000 for a petrol-powered one. Norway, the world leader in electric cars, has almost eradicated the price gap by levying enormous taxes and fees on fossil-fuelled cars. Last month 61% of all new cars sold there were fully electric and another 28% were hybrids. Britain's government is highly unlikely to do the same. It cannot even bring itself to raise fuel duty, which has been stuck at the present level since 2011.
The same combination of bold ambition and modest detail runs through Mr Johnson's other green plans. His pledge to quadruple power production from offshore wind leaves unanswered the question of how energy markets will cope with a surge in intermittent supply. He favours exciting industrial ventures such as battery gigafactories, zero-emission aeroplanes and carbon capture and storage (a technology that has promised much and delivered little so far) but has provided little money for dull, useful things like grants for home insulation. He mentioned a carbon tax, but provided no details.
If his ten-point plan is unlikely to save the planet, it could help revive his fortunes. Environmentalism usefully unites the Conservative tribes. Old-fashioned shire Tories who fancy themselves stewards of the land like it; so do centrist ""onenation types who want to court younger voters. And Mr Johnson larded his plan with appeals to the working-class Midlands and northern English voters who pushed him to victory last year.
""There will be electric vehicle technicians in the Midlands, construction and installation workers in the north-east and Wales, specialists in advanced fuels in the north-west, he wrote in the Financial Times. He promised jobs for Grangemouth, the Humber, Merseyside, Port Talbot and Teesside. It is hard to recall that the Conservative Party once prized market-based solutions to problems. Or that, as recently as Mr Cameron's tenure, it argued for a shy, retiring state. *"

A tug-of-war between populism, diplomacy and foreign aid is looming
When boris Johnson told Parliament in June that he planned to merge Britain's Department for International Development (dfid) with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (fco), he mocked it as a ""giant cashpoint in the sky"". Its do-gooders, now under the auspices of the clunkilynamed Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (fcdo), may soon have rather less cash to dispense. According to whispers whooshing around Whitehall, the government is thinking of breaking its promise to keep spending 0.7% of gdp every year on foreign aid.
Such a move would come as no surprise to watchers of the wrestling match under way at the fcdo between hard-nosed diplomats and bleeding hearts. The 0.7% figure was enshrined in law in 2015 as a sign of the Conservatives' determination to shed their ""nasty party"" tag. Last year dfid was responsible for dishing out most of the £15bn earmarked by Britain for the poorest of the world.
On the whole, the cash has been well spent, but it has sometimes been tricky to dish it all out. Even last year's weak gdp growth meant an extra £600m had to be divvied up. In an era of covid-imposed recession and looming mass unemployment at home, a populist government was likely to start balking at such generosity to foreigners, however deserving.
The figure has become totemic. But dropping it to, say, 0.6% would still leave Britain as one of the world's biggest donors. As the anti-aid lobby points out, Britain is the sole country in the G7 group of big economies to meet the 0.7% figure, which is promoted by the un. (Only four other countries are as worthy: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden. France spends 0.4%, Italy and Spain around 0.2%, and America less than 0.2%.) And it was already being whittled away, as the government began to define aid more elastically. The Ministry of Defence, the Department of International Trade and other ministries now often mark down spending abroad as aid.
The bigger concern is the merger, which officially occurred on September 1st. Whether or not spending is cut as a proportion of gdp, the fcdo is likely to slice up the cash less effectively. ""It's not a merger, it's the demolition of dfid,"" laments Andrew Mitchell, once the Conservatives' most dynamic boss of dfid.
It is not difficult to work out why man- darins generally favour it. In the past two decades the diplomatic service has been hollowed out by drastic budget cuts, sorely weakening its hand in traditional diplomacy. Britain's representation shrank to only one or two diplomats in nearly half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, invariably outnumbered by staff working for dfid. In at least 14 African countries Britain has no embassies at all (Turkey now has half a dozen more than the uk). In some places the head of the dfid office, by virtue of dispensing vast dollops of aid, carried more weight than the ambassador. Under the merger, the resident ambassador will oversee aid as well as diplomacy. And the number of diplomats is being bumped up.
Even before Tony Blair created dfid as a separate ministry when he came to power in 1997, the aid-and-development arm of the fco was fairly autonomous, with a minister of its own. Now there will be no specific aid minister. dfid's top civil vant has shunted off as a ""special envoy"" for famine prevention. The rejigging of the new department is being overseen mainly by fco types, not aid specialists. ""The idea is to break dfid up into little pieces and scatter it,"" says Nicholas Westcott, a former diplomat who runs the Royal African Society. ""They want to make it hard to separate it out again."" *"

LIVERPOOL
An experiment suggests that people need an incentive to make mass testing work
IF YOU WANT something done on Merseyside, it helps to have Jurgen Klopp on your team. On November 5th, the manager of Liverpool fc posted a short video on social media urging people to get tested for covid-19. ""Regular testing has kept the Premier League going,"" he said. ""Let's do it together; let's do it for Liverpool.""
Mr Klopp's video was part of the ""moonshot"" programme's first major trial. In September, a leak revealed the government was prepared to spend more than £ioobn ($i3obn) on mass testing-an approach championed by Dominic Cummings, then the prime minister's chief adviser. Nothing like that much has been spent yet. But a day after Mr Klopp's video was posted online, anyone living or working in Liverpool was encouraged to get tested, and to continue doing so once a week.
The pilot relies on Innova antigen tests, which pick up proteins the virus sheds. They are less sensitive than more commonly used polymerase-chain-reaction (pcr) tests which look for its genetic sequence, but can be processed on the spot rather than sent to a laboratory. A study by Oxford University and Public Health England found that when carried out by laboratory scientists they catch 79% of positive cases identified by pcr, and 58% when used by self-trained members of the public. They catch 95% of people with high viral loads, who are thought to be most likely to spread the disease.
The idea is that, since you are testing people who otherwise would not have been tested, everyone who is caught is a win. By November 18th, 702 positive cases had been identified in Liverpool. The government is now offering antigen tests to medics around the country, who will use them twice a week, and plans to employ them to enable students to return home at the end of term.
Some public-health professionals fear that people will change their behaviour on falsely receiving the all-clear, possibly even increasing transmission of the virus. While Liverpool is locked down, that is not much of a problem. ""If it comes back negative, I don't really know what I could do dif- ferently,"" says Cara Sutton, a pharmacist getting tested in the south of the city. Lower sensitivity may be more of a problem when loosening existing restrictions. Trials to use tests to allow visitors into care homes will therefore start by employing both pcr and antigen tests.
The other problem Liverpool throws up is getting people to take the tests. Despite Mr Klopp's best efforts, just over 130,000 tests have been carried out. Some 400,000 adults live in Liverpool and more work there. That level of testing will reduce the spread of the virus, but it may not have a dramatic effect on transmission.
At the moment, some people will get tested out of pure altruism, or ""so granny doesn't die"", says a scientist advising the government. But for others, it is unclear what the incentive is: test positive and you must isolate; test negative and you gain nothing besides a little peace of mind. In Slovakia, which recently tested 3.6m people, or 95% of those eligible for the scheme, a negative antigen-test result exempted the receiver from obeying stricter covid rules introduced just before the roll-out.
The Slovakian experiment, which appears to have contributed to a sharp reduction in the spread of the virus, has heartened those in government who are pushing for a similar nationwide blitz. The alternative is a roll-out of the Liverpool model to other hotspots, and greater use of tests by doctors, students and similar groups.
Mr Cummings was recently fired from government, which means that others will have to make the final call. Millions of antigen tests represent a welcome, if curious, leaving gift."

WHEN DOMINIC CUMMINGS, Boris Johnson's chief adviser until last week, leaves a room, he likes to make a childish gesture: he pulls a pin out of an imaginary grenade, and tosses it over his shoulder. The man who engineered Brexit and pushed Mr Johnson to hold the election that won him an 80-seat majority while dragging the government into fights with Parliament, the civil service and its own party, has left Downing Street, and the place looks as if an explosion has hit it. Projects are hanging in the air. Functionaries are running around like headless chickens. The only person who can mend all this is another chief adviser.
More than most leaders, Boris Johnson relies on the people around him, for his positive qualities (optimism and enthusiasm) are counterbalanced by negative ones (disorganisation and drift). He would have been a rotten Mayor of London but for the arrival of competent advisers, notably Simon Milton. He needs a similar deus ex machina to rescue his faltering premiership. Mr Cummings provided Mr Johnson with political genius and intellectual energy, but he lacked most of the qualities a chief adviser needs.
Downing Street could always add to its exorbitant consultants' bills and call in McKinsey to provide a few management bromides (""must be committed to transparency"") to identify the right person to replace him. But a better way would be to read a few books. Start with Machiavelli's ""The Prince""-the first book on politics to describe men as they are, warts and all, rather than as moralists would like them to be, and a wonderful source of eternal insights. Then imitate Machiavelli's method and ""step inside the courts"" of previous leaders by reading lots of history.
Chief advisers fulfil all sorts of vital functions in today's politics. They act as a counter-balance to the civil service and a filter for all those trying to bend a leader's ear. But they also perform an important psychological service: they give their master or mistress somebody to talk to. The best advisers are almost invisible: those who appear in the papers are not doing their job properly. James Baker, chief of staff to both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that the key word in the phrase ""chief of staff"" was ""staff"". There was no photograph in public circulation of Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff and the author of ""The New Machiavelli: How to Wield Power in the Modern World"", during his first year in the job, so newspapers had to publish silhouettes of him.
But subordination to the boss doesn't mean becoming a patsy. Chief advisers need to be able to correct their master's weaknesses as well as magnify their strengths. Patrick Moynihan brought out the best in Richard Nixon by reminding him of Disraeli's advice that the best governments consist of ""Tory men and Whig measures"". Unfortunately there were plenty of other advisers around, such as John Ehrlichman and Bob Haldeman, who were happy to bring out the worst in the president. David Gergen rescued Bill Clinton's first administration from chaos by providing the young staffers who had run his presidential campaign with adult supervision. Mr Johnson needs both a Moynihan and a Gergen-someone who can provide both intellectual drive and adult discipline.
The modern Machiavelli has to be willing to prick ideological bubbles. There is nothing more dangerous for an organisation than self-congratulatory groupthink. Advisers need to be well versed in past mistakes so that they can probe their bosses' ideas and plans for weaknesses before rivals or reality expose those flaws. At the same time, whenever hubris turns to despair, as it so often does in politics, they need to be able to put the babble of daily headlines into perspective. Machiavelli's injunction that both princes and advisers should study history and ""note the actions of great men"" is even more germane today, when too many politicians study economics or, even worse, management science.
The ideal adviser needs to know when to pick fights and when to play nice. Machiavelli was right that change is dangerous because ""he who innovates will have as his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things, and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new"". But too many Tories have come to believe that, because you can't make progress without making enemies, the mere existence of enemies is a sign that you're making progress. Demonising the establishment as a reactionary blob is less effective than co-opting its members by appealing to a mixture of their ambition and their better natures. Not all of the government's ideas for universities, the civil service and the bbc are daft, and a little digging reveals that many insiders agree with some of them.
Rubber levers
Finally, successful advisers also need to roam beyond Downing Street. One of the commonest complaints of prime ministers is that they grasp the levers of power only to discover that they are made of rubber: pull them and they bend rather than moving the machinery of government. This is not, as too many prime ministers conclude, because the levers are defective and the machinery needs to be re-engineered, but because in a pluralistic democracy power is widely distributed. Advisers need to help their bosses build coalitions across the political nation, supping not just with journalists, mps and civil servants but also with city mayors, who rightly feel slighted by the London-focused political system.
Mr Johnson is currently engaged in a grand relaunch of his administration after a disaster-prone 11 months since the election. But none of his fine words about the green industrial revolution will mean a fig unless he can find a modern Machiavelli strong enough to drive policy forward and self-effacing enough to devote himself to the greater glorification of King Boris. The job description is a daunting one, but the successful candidate will have a chance to shape from the shadows the country in the wake of two of the biggest shocks, Brexit and covid-19, that it has received since the second world war."

ISTANBUL
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan starts to face the facts
WHAT A DIFFERENCE a family row makes. Only a few weeks ago, the Turkish lira was plummeting from one record low to another as the central bank sat on its hands, foreigners were dumping Turkish stocks and the country's finance minister, Berat Albayrak, was arguing that exchange rates did not matter. Today the currency is enjoying a big rebound, the stockmarket is soaring, and officials are talking about the need to reform the courts and keep inflation in check.
For more than two years, Turkey's autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had relied on Mr Albayrak, his son-in-law, to run the economy. Mr Albayrak nearly ran it into the ground. With banks dishing out credit at rates below inflation to revive growth, the lira sank by over 40% against the dollar, burning a hole through the savings of millions of Turks. The central bank and state banks wasted at least $100bn in precious foreign reserves in an abortive attempt to salvage the currency.
Mr Erdogan finally slammed on the brakes. On November 7th he sacked the central-bank governor and replaced him with one of Mr Albayrak's rivals. A day later, an indignant Mr Albayrak, once touted as his father-in-law's prospective successor, stepped down. Since then the lira has responded with its best weekly performance (a 10% rally) for two decades.
The change in tone has been remarkable. The new central-bank governor, Naci Agbal, and the new finance minister, Lutfi Elvan, are making all the right noises about stabilising the currency and bringing inflation down to single digits. The justice minister, who has presided over a sweeping crackdown against government opponents since 2017, has discovered a passion for the rule of law, asking judges to comply with constitutional-court rulings and help improve the climate for foreign investors. Those investors are needed: reeling from the pandemic, the economy shrank by nearly 10% in the second quarter.
Even Mr Erdogan, a sworn enemy of high interest rates, now says Turkey may have to swallow ""a bitter pill"", meaning a dose of austerity. As The Economist went to press, the central bank was expected to impose a spectacular rate rise of at least 400 basis points. Anything less might have triggered another run on the lira.
Mr Erdogan had to surrender to market pressure and sack Mr Albayrak. ""There was a real chance that the thing would have snowballed and you would have a fullblown currency crash"" unless Turkey's leader had changed course, says Paul McNamara of gam Investments. Another option would have been to seek help from the imf, something Mr Erdogan had previously ruled out. The president would also have had to pay a political price. A group of 30 to 40 ruling-party parliamentarians is said to have threatened to defect to the opposition unless Mr Albayrak resigned. The overhaul of Mr Erdogan's economic team has at least bought him some breathing space, says Ugur Gurses, a Turkish economist.
It may also help Turkey's leader to cope with the loss of a good friend in Washington. For the past four years Mr Erdogan has been able to count on Donald Trump to look away while Turkey evicted American troops from parts of north-eastern Syria, clashed with European allies in the Mediterranean, deployed Syrian mercenaries to Libya and Azerbaijan, and locked up thousands of people on terror charges thinner than baklava dough. Mr Trump also shielded Turkey from sanctions over its purchase of an s-400 air-defence system from Russia. He may have tried to hold up an investigation into a Turkish state bank accused of laundering Iranian money.
Under Joe Biden, who earlier this year referred to Mr Erdogan as an ""autocrat"" who ""needs to pay a price"", things will get tougher. America will draw red lines and enforce them more credibly, says Lisel Hintz of Johns Hopkins University. Mr Erdogan will have less room to cut deals with the White House. Sanctions over the s-400 will be harder to sidestep, especially after Turkey tested the system in October. ""Ankara will no longer have the kind of protection provided by Trump and has to get its house in order, politically and economically,"" says Asli Aydintasbas of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. ""There may be no direct causality, but there's no doubt Albayrak's resignation has to do with Turkey being more prepared for the challenges ahead.""
With friends like these
Yet there is a limit to how far Mr Erdogan is willing to go to save the lira and placate the new American administration. For all the recent talk of reforms, he is not about to loosen his grip on national institutions, give up on growth or stop tormenting opponents. His prosecutors recently opened an investigation into Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition mayor of Istanbul, for criticising one of the president's pet projects, a canal between the Black and Marmara Seas. Whether the central bank makes the right call still depends less on its governor than on the president. Mr Albayrak may be a useful scapegoat, but he is not the true problem in Turkey.
Even if Mr Erdogan were sincere about democratic reforms and the need to patch things up with his Western partners, the coalition he has sealed with his country's ultranationalists, who support him in parliament and in the security forces, will make it difficult for him to take the right steps. ""He has locked himself into this path,"" says Ozgur Unluhisarcikli of the German Marshall Fund, another think-tank. ""I can't see how he can make substantial changes without destroying the alliance structure he has set up.""
Mr Erdogan must hope the beginning of the Biden presidency is better than the end of the Trump one. On November 16th Mr Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told a French newspaper that America and Europe needed to deal with Turkey's ""aggressive actions"" over the past few months. A day later Mr Pompeo arrived in Istanbul, where he paid a visit to the Ecumenical Patriarch to discuss religious freedoms in Turkey (and probably bemoaned Mr Erdogan's conversion of the Hagia Sophia, an ancient Christian basilica, into a mosque). He did not meet a single Turkish official. *"

A quarter of a century after peace was brokered, the country is still wretched
THE WAR IN Bosnia-Herzegovina raged for three and a half years. Then, in 1995, after three weeks of being virtually locked up in an American air-base in Dayton, Ohio, the warring leaders struck a deal to end it. Bosnia was devastated, half its population had fled or been ethnically cleansed, and more than 100,000 were dead. The country has been at peace ever since. But on November 21st, exactly a quarter of a century after the Dayton deal, not many Bosnians will be celebrating.
Most are miserable, and it is not hard to see why. Incomes are low, public services are poor and politicians argue about the same things they fought the war over. Bosnians are ageing and emigrating, cities are choked by smog and, says Adnan Cerimagic of the European Stability Initiative, a think-tank, ""half of the country's 14-yearolds are functionally illiterate.""
Before the war there were some 4.2m people in Bosnia. Today there are probably between 2.7m and 3.3m, though no one knows for sure. With such a small population, it is sometimes said that all the country needs is a mayor. Instead Dayton created a complex system designed to make sure that none of the country's three main ethnic groups could dominate the others. Twenty-five years on it often defies logic, and seems to serve the interests only of nationalist politicians who have successfully resisted any attempts at reform.
The tiny country has a weak central government, three presidents, two ""entities"" and an autonomous town. The vast majority of Serbs live in the Republika Srpska (rs), while Bosniaks (a term used to refer to Bosnia's Muslims, who make up around half of the country's population) and Croats live mainly in the ten cantons of what is called the Federation. Most, though not all, main parties are ethnically based, and on the big questions of governance and international relations their leaders rarely agree. An international ""High Representative"" lingers in the country only so that he could use his far-reaching powers if peace were under threat.
Milorad Dodik, who has long dominated the politics of the rs, derides Bosnia and talks of independence and integration with Serbia. Bosnian Croat leaders often call for their own ""third entity"". Bosniaks celebrate November 25th as ""statehood day"" because that is when modern Bosnia was founded in 1943. In schools all three ethnic groups learn different histories. Before the war 13% of marriages were mixed and in Sarajevo a third were. In 2019 the number of mixed marriages was only 3%. A survey in 2018 found that 49% of young Bosnians want to leave.
Gloom is so all-pervasive that it is common for parents to press their children to do so. Ivana Cook, from Tuzla, was born a few months before the end of the war. She says that of 25 students in her graduating class from school, 20 have gone. Ms Cook's mother says that she regrets not leaving herself after the war. Ms Cook did not want to emigrate, but she is lucky. She has a job and a flat which she shares with her boyfriend. Some 80% of Bosnians her age still live with their parents, and youth unemployment is high.
In the early post-war years Bosnians did not mix much, and it is still the case that many young people from mono-ethnic towns or villages, or the divided city of Mostar, have never met someone of a different ethnicity. But it is less so than before, and Bosnian politics is far more nuanced than is often believed. On November 15th a Serb was elected as mayor of overwhelmingly Bosniak central Sarajevo. The vast majority of young Bosnians are not hostile to one another. They play sports together, civil-society activists work on causes together and many criss-cross the inter-entity border daily for work, to shop 1 or just to have fun somewhere else.
But that does necessarily mean that the first generation not to remember the war is going to change the country. Last week's local elections saw Drasko Stanivukovic, a 27-year-old, elected as mayor of Banja Luka, the capital of the rs. He says that its leadership is corrupt and needs to be replaced. He is against independence for rs, but otherwise he holds many of the same Serbian nationalist positions as Mr Dodik.
Hana Curak, aged 26, a sociologist from Sarajevo, says a lack of opportunities is the bane of her generation. You need connections with people in power to find a job, said 87% of young people polled in 2018. Because a higher proportion of the educated and liberal young leave, Ms Curak says, more of those with less progressive and more nationalist values remain. She thinks that by legitimising a system in which ethnicity is paramount, Dayton has actually served to make many of her generation ""even more conservative and nationalistic than their parents"".
""What scares me"", says Mr Cerimagic, is that ""for years people have been saying it is up to the young people to save us from this misery, but then my impression is that they are not really different from the rest of us."" For those dedicated to creating a better Bosnia, ""it is going to be a long struggle."""

BERLIN
Some activists are running out of patience with Germany's Green party
OVER A YEAR ago protesters installed themselves in and around the 250-year-old oak and beech trees of the Dannenröder, a forest and water reserve in the southern German state of Hesse. From their lofty treehouses and makeshift huts, they vow to protect 27 hectares of ""Danni"" that face clearance for an extension to the A49 motorway. Police have begun to evict the protesters, sparking scuffles, arrests and a handful of injuries. But what looks like a familiar environmental protest resonates beyond the wildlands of Hesse, especially for Germany's Greens. Dannenröder tests the party's ability to balance its radical promise with its ambitions to govern.
Nationally the Greens, who sit in opposition, urge a moratorium on motorway-building. But in iiof Germany's 16 states, including Hesse, they form part of ruling coalitions, which means grappling with the messy compromises of government. Tarek al-Wazir, Hesse's Green economy and transport minister, says he opposes the A49 but is obliged to implement it, as motorways are a federal responsibility. Bettina Hoffmann, a Green mp fighting to halt the A49, insists the state and national parties are united in leaning on the federal government to stop the project. But tensions are clear.
In recent years the Greens have been doing the splits: aiming to harness the energy of climate movements like Fridays for Future (fff) while reaching beyond their base of well-heeled urbanites-including to the sort of voters who might use the A49. The success of the Greens' two leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, who have cemented the party in second place in polls, seemed to have ended tensions between the Greens' centrist Realo and radical Fundi wings. But a new generation of campaigners have grown frustrated with a party they see as insufficiently committed to meeting Germany's climate pledges. ""I sometimes think the Greens don't know what we mean by 'climate emergency',"" says Luisa Neubauer, an fff activist and party member.
The strains matter. In Baden-Württemberg, the only state where the Greens lead a ruling coalition, activists irritated by the party's cosiness with the car industry have formed a ""Climate List"" to contest state elections in March. Winfried Kretschmann, the state's Green premier, says the list threatens his reelection bid. Party insiders grumble that young activists do not understand the give-and-take of democracy. The ascendancy of climate politics has helped the Greens' rise. Now it complicates it."

A sacked reformer becomes president
WHEN THEIR 5,000 ballot papers ran out, the angry crowd in the scruffy London suburb of Beckton began chanting: ""We want to vote!"" There were similar scenes in Paris and Frankfurt. The numbers of diaspora Moldovans clamouring to cast their ballots were huge, and the country's electoral commission had failed to anticipate how many slips they would need. In the diaspora 93% plumped for Maia Sandu as president. On November 15th she defeated Igor Dodon, the Socialist incumbent, winning 58% of the overall vote.
Moldova is often characterised as a country split between those who want closer ties with the West and those who want them with Russia. But geopolitics is not what motivated most Moldovan voters when they unseated Mr Dodon, though he is reported to have visited Moscow more than 20 times in the past four years. For Ms Sandu, who was briefly prime minister last year, the single most important issue has long been corruption.
Prey to rapacious oligarchs and unscrupulous politicians, Moldova is the poorest country in Europe, with a gdp per head of just $4,500. Thirty years ago it had 4.4m citizens. So many have left that fewer than 3m may have stayed behind. But, as the Beckton voters show, the leavers still care. If less money had been stolen at home, fewer of them would be toiling abroad.
Covid-19 has been a game-changer, says Vadim Pistrinciuc, a former deputy minister. Unemployment has soared, small and family businesses have been devastated and, unlike those elsewhere in Europe, have had little help from the government ""because there is nothing to help them with. People have made the connection between our weak state and corruption.""
Ms Sandu used to come across as rather chilly. In socially conservative Moldova her enemies have emphasised her childlessness and accused her of being a lesbian, which she denies. In the campaign she talked of her family and widened her appeal. Expectations will be high, but the president's powers are limited. She will seek a snap parliamentary election. The Socialist-led government is expected to cling on for the moment, though its legitimacy has clearly been dented by Mr Dodon's defeat. President Sandu will hope to capitalise on her current popularity and build the momentum her party needs to take full control of the government."

Ireland and Lithuania have much in common. Both are small, Catholic, Europhile, enjoy a tricky relationship with a larger neighbour and have cuisines heavy on potatoes. Both also left it late when it came to gay rights. Homosexual acts were decriminalised only in 1993 in both countries. But since then, things have diverged. In the space of a generation, Ireland went from considering homosexuality a crime to allowing gay marriage and electing a gay taioseach with little fuss. Life for gay Lithuanians has been less happy. Laws banning gay ""propaganda"" are still on the books. Civil partnerships, let alone same-sex marriage, remain a pipe-dream. Merely living without fear would be an improvement: 84% of lgbt people in Lithuania are not comfortable revealing their identity.
Where an iron curtain once split Europe, a rainbow curtain now divides the continent. In western Europe, gay people enjoy a quality of life better than anywhere on the planet. They are free to marry and adopt children, and are protected from discrimination in all walks of life. Things in eastern Europe are not so good. In seven eu countries, including Poland, Hungary and Romania, less than half the population agree that gay people should have the same rights as straight ones. Civil partnerships are not offered in six eu countries, all in central and eastern Europe. Poland has introduced ""LGBT-free zones"", a legally meaningless gimmick with the practical effect of declaring open season on gay people. Meanwhile, Hungary is working on a law that will ban gay couples from adopting. For gay people behind the Rainbow Curtain-which covers about a quarter of the Eu's population-life can be grim.
For a continent that prides itself on gay rights, the split between west and east is a scar. After all, gay rights hold outsize importance in European life. Denmark was the first country to allow civil partnerships, and the Netherlands was the first to introduce gay marriage, in 2001, the same year that it allowed same-sex couples to adopt. In Brussels, gay rights are an area of diversity eu officials are comfortable talking about. When race is brought up officials wince, reminded of the almost preposterous lack of non-white faces within eu institutions. There are, however, plenty of gay people in the corridors of power. The Eurovision Song Contest, one of the few transcontinental events, is a festival of camp. (Although not for everyone: the year that Conchita Wurst, an Austrian drag act, won the event, Poland entered a decidedly heteronormative act featuring buxom women seductively churning butter.)
Improved rights for gay people were a quid pro quo for membership when the eu expanded eastward from 2004. Romania, for instance, was forced to ditch its law against homosexuality before it was allowed to enter in 2007. With the prospect of eu membership looming over the political class, complaints were confined to bishops in the Romanian Orthodox church. (Sample quote: ""We want to enter Europe, not Sodom and Gomorrah.""). Once they were in the club, however, this leverage disappeared and backsliding began. When Law and Justice, the governing right-wing conservative party from Poland, first came to power in 2005, one of its immediate actions was to scrap the government department responsible for lgbt policies. Things were so bad that Robert Biedron, a Polish мер and one of the country's few prominent lgbt figures, says he started learning Swedish in case he had to flee. Just as governments in Poland and Hungary have trampled over judicial independence and free media, so too have they cracked down on gay rights. Gay people in general are another victim of the eu's inability to ensure that countries maintain the standards that allowed them into the club in the first place.
Since family law is mainly up to member states, there is little the eu can do if a member state wants to stop a lesbian marrying or a gay couple adopting. Where Brussels can muscle in is when the right to free movement collides with bigoted domestic law. What happens if a gay couple and their child move to a country where such relationships are not recognised? The European Commission wants to smooth out these bumps, ensuring that the link between children and their gay parents is not severed if they move to a country where gay adoption is banned. While few are affected directly, such a move has potent symbolic power. Definitions of online hate speech will be widened to include homophobic abuse, too. Towns that introduced LGBT-free zones in Poland had eu funds cut. But the main thing the eu can offer is a pulpit, hammering those leaders who refuse to treat citizens equally.
Peek behind the curtain
Such banging of the drum for gay rights by Brussels does come with a risk. It is a fight both sides want to have. Normally, populists rely on caricatures when taking aim at Brussels. In this case there is less need. Populist politicians will claim that the eu is doing all it can to force countries to treat gay people better. eu officials will happily plead guilty. A common complaint is that eastern Europe is expected to go through decades of social change in the space of a few years. (Denmark legalised gay sex in 1933, but it took nearly eight decades before gay people could marry.) Change can happen quickly, though. Ireland enjoyed a social revolution in less than a generation, and Malta passed a slew of legislation that helped it become the most gay-friendly country in the eu in just a few years. There are few complaints about the pace of transformation in central and eastern Europe when it comes to living standards.
With the eu cowering beneath a second wave of covid-19 cases and in the middle of its biggest-ever recession, a fight over gay rights could easily fall down the pecking order. It should not. The eu has made much of promoting ""European values"". Usually, these tend to mean a respect for the rule of law, which is hardly inherently European. When it comes to gay rights, however, Europe has genuinely been a pioneer. Until a gay person in Vilnius or Budapest has the same rights as one in Dublin or Madrid, European values are no such thing at all. *"

WASHINGTON, DC
President Donald Trump's refusal to concede is harming America
Stop the steal"" has become the anthem of outraged Republicans who believe President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats stole his re-election by committing massive voter fraud. It is the hashtag they rally around online and the slogan they chant when they throng in the streets, as they did on November 14th in Washington, dc, earning a laudatory drive-by from the presidential motorcade.
But this is not the first time surrogates of Mr Trump have deployed it. Roger Stone, a former adviser to the president who recently had his prison sentence for several convictions commuted, actually founded a group by that name in April 2016-then to expose Senator Ted Cruz's purported plot to steal the Republican nomination. Similar pre-emptive claims of voter fraud were made before the general-election contest with Hillary Clinton in 2016. Now that Mr Trump has actually lost, the slogan has finally been deployed in earnest.
Mr Trump has a long-held aversion to admitting defeat, or really conceding any fault at all. That is now throwing up an unprecedented scenario: an incumbent American president refusing to hand over power due to baseless claims of electoral fraud. It is a serious democratic norm to trample over-one easy to underplay because of public confidence that other institutions, like the courts and the military, will not accede to Mr Trump's wishes. The chances of a reversed decision are low. The lawsuits filed in the swing states that Mr Trump lost are floundering. Despite Mr Trump's recent replacement of civilian leadership at the Department of Defence, there is little risk of a self-coup.
Even if this low-energy autogolpe does not succeed, Mr Trump's actions are still alarming. Presidential transitions involve a large number of civil servants: some 4,000, are politically appointed, with 1,200 requiring confirmation by the Senate. By not conceding, Mr Trump has stalled this process. Mr Biden is not receiving his classified presidential daily briefings. His team does not have access to secure governmental communications, relying instead on encrypted messaging apps. The commission to study the 9/11 attacks found that the shortened transition in 2000, caused by the disputed result in Florida, may have contributed to American vulnerability to terrorist attacks. By contrast, the wellmanaged transition between George W. Bush and Barack Obama in the midst of the global financial crisis enabled faster implementation of economic relief. Asked what was at stake this time, Mr Biden said ""more people may die"" if the Trump administration refused to co-ordinate on virus suppression and vaccine distribution.
The stalled transition is also a test for the president's party. Never-Trump Republicans had hoped the president would be dealt a stinging electoral rebuke, forcing a reckoning among accommodationist party grandees. That did not happen. Down-bal- 1 ? lot Republicans benefited from the high turnout among Mr Trump's supporters, probably keeping control of the Senate and eroding the Democratic majority in the House. They also wiped out Democrats in state elections, bringing power over gerrymandering. ""They think the ducking and accommodating of Trump without quite sounding like Trump-that worked fine,"" says Bill Kristol, a conservative writer long opposed to the president.
Most prominent Republicans still in office have continued to humour the president. ""All legal ballots must be counted. Any illegal ballots must not be counted,"" said Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. The implication that there may be sufficient fraudulent ballots to alter the election's outcome has so far proven to be baseless. Only a few exceptional Republicans, like Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, have acknowledged the results and congratulated Mr Biden.
Others have gone even further than Mr McConnell's careful statement. Brad Raffensperger, the Republican in charge of administering elections in Georgia, which Mr Biden narrowly won, has come under withering criticism from members of his own party for refusing to tilt the result in Mr Trump's favour. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, the Republican senators who face run-offs in January that will determine control of the Senate, issued a joint statement calling for his resignation. Lindsey Graham, an especially Trumpist senator, personally called Mr Raffensperger to dispute the absentee ballots cast in the race.
At some point, reality will intervene. The remaining lawsuits will fizzle. States have started to certify their election results. The electoral college will formally vote on December 14th to make Mr Biden the next president. More and more Republicans are telegraphing that they understand this by, for example, saying that Mr Biden probably ought to be receiving classified intelligence briefings after all.
Yet the equivocations now portend a Republican Party that remains firmly under the grips of post-truth Trumpism. This may be a rational strategy in the short term to ensure the president campaigns in the coming, critical Senate run-offs in Georgia. But it will probably last beyond that. Mr Trump will relish his role as kingmaker who anoints the winner of Republican primary contests by tweet. The president has reportedly also been talking of running in 2024, which would effectively freeze the next generation of Republicans in place.
Hyperpartisanship has wreaked havoc on American politics, but at least most voters could agree that the other side won fairly and squarely. That no longer appears to be the case. According to our latest poll from YouGov, 88% of those who voted for Mr Trump think that the election result is illegitimate. There are always some gripes after hotly contested races. But the scale this time-like Mr Trump's refusal to acknowledge the results-is breathtaking.
During the much-closer election in 2000, where 537 votes in Florida separated winner from loser, 36% of Mr Gore's voters thought the result was illegitimate. Similarly, 23% of supporters of Hillary Clinton felt fleeced after her election loss in 2016. Perhaps as the weeks wear on, and Mr Biden inches closer to inauguration, the number of Republicans who see him as illegitimate will shrink. But Mr Trump seems unlikely to ever concede, and would rather establish the myth of his stolen election as a new lost cause among his supporters. If that happens, it would add a dangerous strain to America's factionalism-one that cannot be easily contained. *"

The intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm) took off from Kwajalein Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on November 17th. American satellites spotted its bright plume at once. They alerted Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado which in turn informed the uss John Finn, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer poised northeast of Hawaii. A hatch on the deck flipped open and spewed out a torrent of flames as an SM-3 Block IIa interceptor shot up and out. High above the Earth, it collided with the descending icbm.
It was the first time an interceptor fired from a warship had shot down a (mock) icbm in space. ""Politically this test is a big deal,"" says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a thinktank. Russia and China have always complained that American missile defences undermine their own deterrents. America has always batted away those concerns. When the SM-3 was developed, America first said it would protect aircraft-carriers, and later that it would shield Europe from Iranian medium-range missiles. In fact, only a software tweak was needed to make it work against longer-range ones. Now that the system has been demonstrated against an icbm, both Russia and China will claim vindication.
America already has a missile shield for its homeland, comprising 44 groundbased interceptors (gbis) in Alaska and California. These were previously the only ones to have shot down an icbm. Yet these are staggeringly expensive, relatively few in number and unreliable in tests. The ship-based system, known as Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (bmd), has several advantages. It can be rolled out more quickly, moved where needed and allows America to field many more interceptors.
Currently, 44 destroyers and cruisers are equipped with Aegis bmd. Each has 90plus launch tubes, so several thousand interceptors could theoretically be put to sea (in practice, the tubes also carry other weapons, like Tomahawk cruise missiles). The navy plans to fit Aegis to 65 ships, 11 of which would be allocated for the protection of the continental United States. Just three to four ships deployed off America's coast could cover its whole landmass, notes George Lewis, a missile-defence expert who recently retired from Cornell University. The idea is that if gbis failed to take out a missile, Aegis could mop it up at a lower altitude-though SM-3 IIas can still reach three times higher than the International Space Station.
In practice, notes Mr Acton, intercepting an incoming icbm would still be forbiddingly difficult. They would travel a longer distance and therefore arrive at greater speed than in the test, armed with countermeasures to trick the interceptor and potentially in sufficient numbers to whelm ""SM-3 IIas can't fundamentally undermine China's or Russia's nuclear deterrents, or even frankly North Korea's,"" he says. But that is not how those countries are likely to see the matter.
Russia has long held that arms-control talks ought to include not just offensive systems, like bombers and missiles, but also defensive ones which might neuter them. It has been especially irked by landbased Aegis systems built in Romania and Poland. The new test ""is likely to have a crushing effect on prospects for new nuclear arms control agreements"", says Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy organisation.
""It will also provide motivation (or justification) for Russia and China to diversify and grow their nuclear weapons arsenals,"" she adds-the logic being that more missiles will be needed to saturate stiffer defences. China is especially jittery as it has relatively few land-based icbms.
Ms Grego notes that because the sm-3 interceptor can also take out satellites- something America demonstrated in 2008-deploying more of them will have an impact on space security, too. But with the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programmes simmering, the incoming Biden administration is not about to abandon a flexible seaborne means of shielding its European and Asian allies. *"

Two new reports propose a rich feast of reforms for America's foreign service
Joe biden, the president-elect, wants to end his country's ""forever wars and believes diplomacy should be ""the first instrument of American power. He promises to reinvest in America's hollowed-out diplomatic corps, the better to nurture alliances and tackle the global issues of the future, such as climate change and greatpower competition. But how to make the foreign service fit for the future? Two new reports, one from the Council on Foreign Relations (cfr), a think-tank, the other the result of an extensive project at Harvard University, offer thoughts.
Both say the State Department is in crisis. Its problems stretch back well beyond the Trump administration but have deepened dramatically under it. Morale is low, budgets are squeezed and the foreign service is suffering from an exodus of talent. Diplomats' careers are stymied by the politicisation of senior posts. For the first time in a century, not one of the 23 Senate-confirmed assistant-secretary positions is a serving career official, and 43% of ambassadors are political appointees, also a modern record. The story on diversity is dismal: in March the Senior Foreign Service was 90% white and 69% male. Only five of 189 ambassadors are African-American (over their two terms, Barack Obama appointed 46 African-American ambassadors and George W. Bush had 44). Under Donald Trump, a quarter-century trend of rising female ambassadors has gone into reverse.
Remedies, say the reports, need to be radical. The cfr emphasises immediate steps an incoming administration can take to start revitalising the State Department, from appointing a chief technology officer to bringing in climate experts and more Chinese-speakers (the department still has more Portuguese-speakers than the combined total for Mandarin and Arabic), as well as issuing a public apology to career diplomats who have been subjected to political retaliation. The Harvard report suggests a ten-point action plan for the longer term, including a new mission and a new name for the foreign service: the ""United States Diplomatic Service. Taken together, the reports offer a rich menu for reform.
A four-course selection for the new administration would include, for starters, an infusion of resources. The Harvard group recommends a 15% increase in foreign-service personnel, to make it possible to have a ""training float like that of the 1 ? armed forces. This would involve an increase of 2,000 positions over three years, followed by a four-year commitment for a further 1,400-1,800 posts to fill projected staffing gaps. A diplomatic reserve corps, also on the military model, would create a surge capacity for international crises.
Second, another appetiser, would come a sweeping professionalisation of the top ranks of diplomacy. The Harvard team recommends that, by 2025, 90% of ambassadors, and 75% of all assistant secretaries of state, should be career diplomats. Far lower proportions of political appointees would bring the foreign service into line with the military and intelligence services.
The calorific main course would consist of a transformation of the State Department's culture. It would involve slashing layers of bureaucracy (policy recommendations can collect 15 or more sign-offs on their way to the secretary of state). It would recreate mid-level entry-points to the foreign service. Actions to make America's diplomats more closely reflect the country they represent would include appointing a chief diversity officer and tackling structural bias in recruitment and promotion.
And for dessert? Both reports argue that the foreign service's mandate for the future should be enshrined in legislation. This has happened three times in the past century-most recently in 1980, at the height of the cold war. Discussions with military and intelligence experts informed this recommendation, too. ""Unless you have some of these things in the law, they won't last,"" says Nicholas Burns of Harvard, an ex-diplomat. He detects ""considerable interest"" on Capitol Hill. But to get reforms through a polarised Congress would require diplomatic skills of the highest order. *"

CHICAGO
Charles Koch offers partial regrets for his partisan ways
Boy did we screw up. What a mess!"" B Towards the end of his new book, Charles Koch, the billionaire owner of Koch Industries, the second-largest private firm in America, offers this surprising mea culpa. For years he gave extraordinary sums to Republican campaigns, encouraging partisan confrontation. (He and associates probably guided over $1bn in political spending in the past decade). Today he would like readers to know that he boobed. He says he picked the ""wrong road"".
The wizard from Wichita is too coy to set out in detail what he, his late brother David, and their political action committee, Americans For Prosperity (afp), were up to. Soon after the election of Barack Obama, he writes, ""we started engaging directly in major party electoral politics"". They mostly funded enthusiasts for the Tea Party movement. This fostered tribalism and weakened moderate Republicans. Mr Koch now regrets that this meant most efforts at bipartisan cooperation amount to ""a sick joke"". He worries, too, that such dysfunction is pushing youngsters to favour socialism.
What is behind his admission? In ""Believe in People"", he claims his goal was ""not to toot my own horn"". Yet he must have noted the widespread, unflattering, coverage after his brother David died last year. The 85-year-old knows his own reputation is toxic on the left, for his hostility to Obamacare and ongoing denial of climate science. He has also lost standing on the right, where politicians mostly prefer the big-spending populism of Donald Trump. The author-who does not mention the president-is dismayed by most of his policies: the increases in tariffs, the tendency to pick corporate favourites, the curtailment of legal immigration.
His writing is a mix of family memoir, stories of corporate good deeds and calls for government to shrink so the needy can better tug at their bootstraps. The author seems to argue that philanthropists and well-meaning activists will do most to tackle inequality, deaths from despair, falling life expectancy, racism and other social ills. That won't change sceptics' minds about him, but it is rare to hear a prominent figure express such blunt regrets for past actions. He now argues that partnership-such as the First Step bipartisan efforts he backed in 2018 to reform the criminal justice system-achieves more than party confrontation. He has also started sending smaller sums to Democratic candidates.
Mr Koch has not changed his spots entirely, though. afp poured millions into this year's elections. These include help given recently to David Perdue, a Republican senatorial candidate in a run-off in Georgia. Meanwhile the afp's website brags of how it lobbied to get Amy Coney Barrett installed quickly on the Supreme Court last month (to Democratic fury), just as it pushed for Brett Kavanaugh two years ago. A road once taken can be hard to leave again."

CHICAGO
Parallel political scandals embroil leading politicians in Ohio and Illinois
LARRY HOUSEHOLDER sounds unrepentant. Until July the Republican was speaker of Ohio's state assembly-a politician best known for his prodigious fundraising and helping his party colleagues raise cash. Then in July the feds came knocking. Along with his campaign strategist and three lobbyists, he was arrested and charged with racketeering. Federal investigators say the men took $60m from a power company, widely reported to be FirstEnergy. It was transferred via a charity set up as a front. In return they passed a bill by which the state was to dish out over $1bn for two failing nuclear plants.
On his arrest Mr Householder lost the speakership but he fights on, denying any wrongdoing. He is said to have spent $1m already on lawyers. This month he was reelected, getting more votes and a bigger majority than two years ago. Voters were unbothered by news, late in October, that two of his co-accused had already pleaded guilty (and both pointed fingers at the exspeaker). Nor did voters fuss that he could face 20 years in prison if convicted. As for the wider political impact, Mark Weaver, a political operative in Ohio, calls it a murky tale but says Mr Householder's relative lack of fame means the impact will be slight.
That is not the case in a parallel case unfolding in Illinois. This week Democrats there-plotting by phone and Zoom, as the virus kept them from Springfield-looked ready to topple their own speaker. Mike Madigan is a wisp of a man compared with barrel-chested Mr Householder. But he is the more powerful, indeed legendary, character. Known as the Velvet Hammer, Mr Madigan is reckoned to be the state's most powerful politician, one who has seen off many governors of both parties. First elected in 1970, when Nixon was president, he has been speaker since 1983 (apart from a brief interlude in the 1990s). A relic of the era of Democratic machine politics, he has frequently been accused of wrongdoing- over a scandal at a commuter rail system in Chicago, and a sexual-harassment case that took down his chief of staff-yet he always slipped away unscathed.
This time could be different. As in Ohio, federal investigators appeared this summer. They pressed charges setting out how an energy company, Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), handed jobs, cash and contracts to pals of the politician. Their investigation spanned eight years to 2019. In a plea bargain ComEd has already admitted to paying $1.3m in return for two laws that weakened regulators' checks on how it set rates. That earned the company, at customers' expense, an estimated $150m. It has already agreed to pay a $200m fine and Fidel Marquez, who ran its government affairs office until last year, pleaded guilty to bribery in September.
That leaves Mr Madigan vulnerable. He has not been arrested or charged and he denies any wrongdoing. But a 38-page deferred prosecution agreement between prosecutors and ComEd sets out in detail how federal investigators see the dubious role of ""public official A"" who is bluntly identified as the speaker. Voters, especially beyond Chicago, sound fed up with the whiffs of scandal around him. After they delivered a relatively poor result for Democrats in elections this month the governor, J.B. Pritzker, and both senators for the state, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, all Democrats, rounded on the speaker. Mr Durbin called the Democratic party in Illinois a ""corrupt organisation"" and said the speaker and his allies must go. Forcing him out, however, depends on swaying Democratic state legislators, many of whom dread any idea of crossing Mr Madigan.
Rich Miller, a well-connected journalist in Springfield, is a veteran watcher of failed plots against Mr Madigan. This is ""by far the closest it's got for him, politically and legally"", he says, especially after investigators bugged phones of his close officials. As for politics, Anne Stava-Murray, a newish Democrat representative who led a lonely rebellion against Mr Madigan two years ago, says that she has rallied 13 colleagues, notably many women, to defy the speaker. If true, and they hold their nerve, that is enough to remove him.
One puzzle is why energy companies are mired in dirt in both states-after all, machine politicians used to work through unions and local government departments. Today energy firms have costly old assets to maintain, such as nuclear plants, while demand for electricity is flat at best. Their fortunes thus depend on regulatory change and getting subsidies or tax breaks, in the gift of politicians. In return, they can offer jobs and favours for friends in office. Power may corrupt, but in the Midwest it is power firms that corrupt absolutely."

WASHINGTON, DC
Should development be prevented to preserve African-American cemeteries?
When charlotte troup leighton first looked around her house, in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, dc, she was drawn to the small wooded meadow that lay behind it. Brambly and overgrown, it formed a picturesque buffer between the house and the thundering multi-lane Capital Beltway beyond. Looking closer, she saw it was dotted with small stones, some engraved by hand, and periwinkle, which is often planted as a ground cover in cemeteries. Though it was not listed, it was an African-American cemetery, established by former slaves in the 1890s.
America has innumerable old AfricanAmerican burial grounds that have been largely forgotten. The one at the back of Ms Troup Leighton's garden, which she is now trying to protect from a plan to widen the highway, was established by Morningstar Tabernacle No. 88, the local chapter of a benevolent society set up by former slaves after the civil war. During segregation, it used members' fees to provide services, from care of the ill and destitute to education and burial. Along with a meeting hall, the foundations of which are still visible, and a church, it formed the heart of a tightknit black neighbourhood known as Gibson Grove, named after Sarah Gibson, who was enslaved in Virginia before buying land that she donated to the community. She is one of at least 80 people thought to be buried in the cemetery.
By the middle of the 20th century, as the suburbanisation of a once-rural area pushed up property taxes, many had left; today the area is almost entirely white. The community was dealt a decisive blow in the early 1960s when the highway, built to link the capital's fast-growing suburbs, separated the cemetery and hall from the church. Alexandra Jones, an archeologist who has studied the remnants of the Gibson Grove community, says this pattern, in which highways were driven through the middle of black neighbourhoods, was repeated in many places during the building boom of the 1950s and 1960s.
Today, developers are required to assess whether they are building on graves or historic sites. Yet often they do not. In 2018 the Maryland State Highway Administration published a plan to widen the beltway, potentially disturbing a slice of cemetery land, including parts of the hall's foundations. Its map did not list the cemetery as a burial or historic site, prompting Ms Troup Leighton and Ms Jones to form a group to protect it. The state is now planning to undertake a survey to establish whether the expansion would destroy any graves.
Across America, the fate of AfricanAmerican burial sites depends upon the efforts of local campaigns such as this. That may change if Congress passes the AfricanAmerican Burial Grounds Network Act, which would create a database of historic black burial sites, managed by the National Park Service, and provide funding to research and protect them. It was introduced last year by A. Donald McEachin, a congressman from Virginia, who discovered that his great-grandfather was buried in an African-American graveyard in Richmond which, until a few years ago, was overgrown and strewn with rubbish. The act may become law in 2021.
For an unknown number of burial grounds, the law will have come too late. Earlier this year Richard Stuart, a state senator in Virginia, spotted a headstone in the river that runs alongside the farm he had just bought. He discovered that a two-mile stretch of a barrier, constructed in the 1960s by a previous owner, contained innumerable others. They came from Columbian Harmony, once one of the biggest African-American cemeteries in Washington, dc. It was dug up in the 1960s to make way for development. Many of the graves were moved to a new burial ground in Maryland. But the headstones were sold as scrap. *"

NEW YORK
Successful charters are outperforming traditional public schools in virtual learning, too
NEW YORK CITY'S schools may be closing, but the pupils at Success Academies, a network of charter schools which has placed all of its 20,000 pupils in remote learning, will still be wearing their uniform (vivid, pumpkin-orange shirts with navy trousers) every day of the week. Unlike traditional public schools in the city, which reopened eight weeks ago but are now closing as covid-19 cases spike, Success has remained all-virtual. Just as with their in-person offerings, high-performing charter networks have managed to create an exemplary virtual programme that other schools are starting to learn from.
Eva Moskowitz, the founder of Success, compares the logistics of arranging high-quality remote learning to the D-Day operation. Children needed laptops, science kits, and noise-cancelling headphones. The 7% of her pupils who live in homeless shelters needed internet hotspots. ""Remote 2.0's"" curriculum is continuously refined. Ms Moskowitz tweaked the school schedule, usually sacrosanct, to make more time for smallgroup learning. Unlike many schools, Success did not abandon learning standards or live teaching after closures started in the spring. It required pupils to snappily start school on time and in uniform. If a child is not at her screen by 9am, parents are called.
This approach has achieved ""striking success in the face of the viral challenge,"" notes a report from the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education think-tank. Like Success, Uncommon Schools, another high-performing network with 21,000 pupils, has now made much of its virtual curriculum available free online. At least 227,000 people from every state in America and 92 countries have used the materials. Anyone can log in to download lessons given by its best teachers. One family in Washington, dc, even sought to enroll their child virtually, despite being hundreds of miles from the nearest Uncommon school.
As much as Success, which also shares virtual lesson plans and webinars, and Uncommon are engineering a new model for remote learning, virtual learning is still a pale imitation of in-person instruction. ""I want to get back on campus so badly, says Ms Moskowitz. ""It's just not the same on Zoom."" With covid-19 infections accelerating, though, that might not happen for a while."

The only racist epithets Barack Obama recalls from his first presidential campaign, in his engrossing new memoir, ""A Promised Land"", were uttered by the rural white folk who declared they were ""thinking of voting for the nigger"". He would go on to win the biggest majority of any Democrat since 1964, including by unexpectedly bagging white, working-class states such as Iowa and Ohio. ""Race doesn't matter!"" chanted the crowds that celebrated his victories. Yet two years later Tea Party protesters were waving banners of Mr Obama with a bone through his nose. The proportion of Republicans who said he was Muslim soared-to around half by the end of his presidency. Whereupon millions of those same rural supporters elected the main spreader of racist lies about Mr Obama to be his successor.
As that chronology should suggest, the white backlash to Mr Obama, which Donald Trump rode to the White House, was not inevitable. It was engineered, a product of unprecedented obstruction from the Republican establishment in combination with relentless slander of the president and his adored, politics-loathing wife by the conservative media. ""It's a trip, isn't it?"" murmured Michelle Obama, after glimpsing a Tea Party rally on television. ""That they're scared of you. Scared of us.""
The hate-mongering on Fox News was the channel's stock-intrade. But what were Republican elites so afraid of? They said Mr Obama was dictatorial or radical. Yet the record he describes in his dispassionate yet fluid style suggests how untrue that was. Though he had shortcomings-a tendency to vacillate, a distaste for political cut-and-thrust that bordered on aloofness-Mr Obama was a relatively unassuming chief executive. He rehired his Republican predecessor's defence secretary, awarded a plum cabinet job to his resentful Democratic rival and considered his celebrity status absurd. (On learning he had been awarded the Nobel peace prize, less than a year into his term, he retorted: ""For what?"")
He was also intrinsically moderate. Indeed his presidency, to use a term it popularised, looks in retrospect like a stress-test of the system's ability to embrace that consensus-forging quality.
Consider that Mr Obama's signature health-care and climate policies were based on Republican initiatives. And he diluted the former in a failed bid to get a single Republican vote for it in the Senate, though his party had a supermajority there. A veneer of bipartisan support would make the law more resilient, he thought. And he had no time for those on the left who griped at such compromises. He and his advisers adopted the phrase ""public option"" (which these days counts as the most modest health-care reform Democrats will consider) to refer to any left-wing unicorn.
His moderation was part-learned: he notes that most of the big social reforms started incrementally. But mostly it reflected his background. Raised in Hawaii by his white, Kansan grandparents, he retained a strain of their cultural conservatism-cautious, with a reverence for tradition and community-even after he acquired a more unambiguously black self-awareness and hunger for social justice. Uniting those disparate parts, by acting ""as translator and bridge among family, friends, acquaintances and colleagues"", became at once an identity and a political mission. It also explains his characteristic political traits.
They were the idealism and fine sense of empathy he showed on the trail (though his novelty-""a blank canvas upon which supporters across the ideological spectrum could project their own vision of change""-also helped). His pragmatism and restraint were related qualities. Together they defined his vision of change.
Thus, for example, the constrained idealism of his foreign policy, which is considered less heretical in the dc think-tank realm these days. Thus, too, his nuanced pronouncements on race, including his greatest speech, in 2008, in which he claimed that his grandmother's petty chauvinism was as much a part of him as the overheated America-bashing of his black pastor. (""That was a very nice speech, Bar,"" she responded.) Restrained to a fault, Mr Obama is even unwilling to castigate his enemies. He confesses to a sneaking regard for the Tea Party's organisation. But he comes close to letting Chuck Grassley have it. He was the Republican senator who kept Mr Obama guessing on his health-care bill only to admit that, for all his prevarication, he was never going to back it.
It seems likely that Republican leaders and donors obstructed Mr Obama so feverishly not because they genuinely thought he was an extremist, but because they knew that he was not. It was precisely his attempted bridge-building that was so threatening to them. Because it was at odds with the story they had been telling their voters about the left for a decade. And because, had Mr Obama pulled it off, it would have made his already powerful government hugely popular. Paradoxically, it was by spurning his offer of bipartisanship that the Republicans made him seem, true to the rightwing caricature, overbearing and partisan. It also helped them stymie his plans and thereby dismantle the powerful Democratic trifecta he had assembled at the mid-terms in 2010.
The conventional wisdom, which usually exaggerates individual dramas and downplays structural flaws, still blames Mr Obama for much of that failure. But, notwithstanding his imperfections, it is hard to think what he could have done to avoid it. His presidency represented a genuine effort to break through partisan polarisation which mainly showed what an impossible ambition that was.
Barack to the barricades
This is not a great lookout for Mr Obama's former vice-president- about whom he is scrupulously complimentary and unrevealing. Joe Biden will soon return to the White House for his own stab at restoring bipartisan comity, but with a far weaker mandate than Mr Obama had, and at a more brutally divided time. He will make mistakes. He will be slammed for them. But if his government fails to ease the rancour, he may not be the reason why. *"

MEXICO CITY
Will Mexico become the third country to legalise cannabis for recreational use?
IN THE PUBLIC park outside Mexico's Senate is a small forest of cannabis. Volunteers are staging a plantón (a punning way to say ""sit-in"") to spur lawmakers to legalise weed. They tend to the 1,000 or so plants on Tuesdays and Thursdays, spraying organic insect repellent and picking up leaves. One volunteer, Leopoldo Rivera, calls it ""the first non-clandestine plantation"" of marijuana in Mexico since the government banned it a century ago. The police did not uproot the seedlings in February, when the plantón began. Some plants are now three metres (ten feet) tall.
As The Economist went to press the Senate was due to debate a bill that would make Mexico the third country in the world, after Uruguay and Canada, to legalise cannabis for recreational use nationwide. For Mexico, the change seems riskier. It was once the world's largest producer of cannabis. Campaigners for legalisation are watching how it will go in a country where organised crime is strong, the rule of law is weak and much of the economy is undocumented.
Mexico's route to legalisation has been unusual, and its arrival may yet be delayed. The president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has so far been a bystander. In contrast to the United States, where voters have endorsed reform in state referendums, legalisation has little popular support in Mexico. Surveys suggest that just over a third of voters favour it.
Campaigners have used the courts rather than popular pressure to advance their cause. Anti-discrimination advocates created an opening in 2001 by arguing successfully for adding to the constitution a right to ""human dignity"". The Supreme Court cited it in 2008 when it ruled that all Mexicans have a ""right to the free development of personality"". The principle has been used to protect unfaithful spouses and posh schoolboys who refuse to cut their hair. Now dope-smokers may benefit.
In Mexico it takes five separate rulings by the Supreme Court to establish a precedent that citizens can invoke to disregard unconstitutional laws. Since 2011 the court has been able to invoke its fifth ruling to instruct Congress to rewrite laws by a certain date. In 2019 it used that power for the second time, directing Congress to revoke laws banning cannabis. The deadline has been extended twice, first because lawmakers could not agree, then because of covid-19. The new one is December 15 th.
The jolt of legalisation could provoke gangs to behave even more violently than now. Mexico's murder rate, among the world's highest, reached a record last year. Gangs could diversify faster into such activities as kidnapping and cooking fentanyl. But the shock will be smaller than it would have been four decades ago, when cannabis exports were their core business. Americans in 11 states buy cannabis legally for recreational use and will soon be able to do so in four more. They have less need to import illegal Mexican weed. Mexico's domestic market is relatively small. In 2016 just 2% of Mexicans surveyed admitted to smoking marijuana in the previous year.
The United States' hard line on narcotics prevented previous attempts by Mexico to liberalise. When, in an early experiment with harm reduction, President Lázaro Cárdenas legalised heroin and opened injecting rooms in 1940, the United States cut off supplies of morphine, a heroin substitute. Cárdenas retreated. In the 1970s the United States began training Mexican pilots to drop Paraquat, a herbicide, on farms growing cannabis. Now, if Mexico legalises, the United States is likely to shrug. Presidentelect Joe Biden supports decriminalisation (though not legalisation).
The task of complying with the court's order is being led by Mr López Obrador's Morena party, an assortment of leftists, liberals and evangelicals that controls Congress. Rather than simply removing the cannabis ban, it has opted to establish a framework to regulate its cultivation and sale. Its details are almost as controversial as the principle of legalisation itself. The bill, which might still be amended, would liberalise cautiously. It would ban advertising and smoking in public. Tokers could possess no more than 28 grams (one ounce), as in California. They would be able to grow up to six plants at home with a permit from a new Cannabis Institute.
The draft law creates a framework for exporting the stuff: as a producer of cheap ganja, Mexico could eventually become a big legal supplier to the United States and Canada. Legal weed would provide the Mexican government with tax revenue. But tax and regulation cannot be too burdensome, lest they drive consumers back to the illegal market.
Regulations, such as requiring sellers to be able to trace the product's origin, will confine the market to enterprises with the money and expertise to obey them. That will give an edge to big Canadian firms, and keep out informal sellers, who make up the bulk of commerce in Mexico. The proposed reform is ""totally neoliberal"", says Tania Ramírez, who helped shape the lawsuits that paved the way for legalisation.
Proponents point to social-justice measures in the bill. For five years two-fifths of cultivation licences will be reserved for farmers in municipalities that were subject to weed-eradication schemes. But to get those licences growers may have to install security cameras, barbed wire and the like. That would keep out poor farmers, says Catalina Pérez Correa of cide, a think-tank.
Morena's leaders expect the bill to pass quickly through the Senate, and then the lower house. A possible obstacle is Mr López Obrador, who opposes legalisation for recreational use. Although he has said he will let the legislature decide, he could end Mexico's marijuana dream, for a while, with a disapproving glance. The obligation to legalise would remain, but the deadline might be pushed into next year. Until Congress acts, cannabis will sprout outside its upper chamber, and outside the law."

The country is often seen as a victim of predatory fishing. It is also a culprit
ON MAY 4TH customs officials in Hong Kong impounded the largest illegal haul of shark fins in the territory's history. The documents declared the cargo to be dried fish, but they were in Spanish, not English, which aroused suspicions. Officials found 24 tonnes of fins, most from endangered species such as thresher sharks, with a retail value of $i.im. They came from Ecuador.
Ecuador portrays itself as a victim of illegal, unregulated and unreported (iuu) fishing by Chinese trawlers near the Galapagos islands. In fact, its fishing industry is just as bad, says Max Bello of Mission Blue, an ngo based in California. Ecuadorean vessels fish illegally in protected areas such as Colombia's Malpelo sanctuary and Costa Rica's Cocos island. Since 2018 at least 136 large Ecuadorean fishing vessels have entered the Galapagos islands' reserve, which covers 133,000 square km (51,000 square miles), says the director of the archipelago's national park.
Consumers in Quito and other inland cities buy shark meat thinking it is sea bass. Many boats illegally transfer their catch on the high seas to larger vessels, which carry them to other markets. Under Ecuadorean law fishermen can sell endangered species like sharks or turtles if they catch them unintentionally. Some boats report half their catch as by-catch.
The world is taking notice. Last year the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an American government agency, accused Ecuadorean fishing companies of violating international conservation agreements. The European Union, the biggest buyer of Ecuadorean tuna, has told the country to step up action against iuu or risk losing access to its market. In 2018 a committee within cites, an international convention on trading in endangered species, recommended that its 183 members suspend trade in fish with Ecuador.
Its government is incapable of reining in a powerful industry. Fishing companies employ 100,000 people, and contribute $1.6bn a year, 1.5% of gdp, to the economy. Ecuador's tuna fleet, the largest in the eastern Pacific, has around 115 large mechanised ships. The rest of the fishing industry consists of more than 400 semi-industrial vessels and nodrizas, small boats with no machinery that catch a greater variety of fish. Fishing gets special treatment from the government. It often issues permits for export of shark fins to Peru that do not comply with cites standards, says Oceana Peru, an ngo. Allies of the industry hold important posts at the vice-ministry of aquaculture and fishing. Some have seats in the legislature.
Operators of Ecuadorean-flagged tuna boats say it is fleets from other countries that are responsible for iuu fishing in or near Ecuadorean waters. They say their bycatch is just 2%. Observers, on board under rules issued by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (iattc), a regional organisation, vouch for that claim. Conservationists do not believe them. Purse seining and longlining, the fleet's main ways of fishing, often result in high levels of bycatch. The iattc is a weak organisation, aligned with fishing companies, conservationists say. ""It's like trusting a wolf to be honest about how many sheep it ate,"" says an adviser to legislators who want to tighten regulation. Even if by-catch is as low as the industry claims, it is enough to massacre some species.
Still more controversial than purse seining and longlining is the use of fish aggregating devices (fads). Industrial ships release these into the current that passes through the Galapagos islands' protected area to attract prey, say green groups. Sometimes they fix goats' heads on the devices to lure sharks, say Galapagans. Crews track them with gps and surround them with nets when they leave the protected zones, entrapping turtles, sea lions, manta rays and sharks. Ecuadorean ships deploy more fads than those of any other country, according to a study in 2015 by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Nodriza boats are even harder to regulate. They are not required to sail with observers. They smuggle not only shark fins, but also cocaine. Last year Sea Shepherd, a vigilante conservation group, filmed fishermen aboard a nodriza beheading a shark, a practice that is illegal in Ecuador. The fishermen then played with the head for Sea Shepherd's cameras.
Ecuador's government tried to crack down, especially after the eu's ""yellowcard"" warning. In April the legislature passed a law that increases fines for illegal fishers. Vessels are now prohibited from selling three endangered species of shark, even if they are by-catch, says Jeff LeBlanc, a government adviser. The government has started an advertising campaign to discourage Ecuadoreans from eating shark.
Conservationists say these measures will not work. Ecuador's coast guard and navy do not have enough money to patrol its seas effectively. Ecuador must improve its rules and enforcement before the eu lifts its yellow card, says an eu official.
Conservationists are urging the government to double the size of the Galapagos reserve. That would cripple Ecuador's fishing industry, which competes with China's modern, government-subsidised fleet, says Bruno Leone, president of the National Chamber of Fisheries, a pressure group.
The pain would be temporary, respond advocates of the expansion. Eventually it would lead to an increase in fish stocks and thus to bigger catches. The Galapagos reserve, even though it is poorly policed, has rescued species threatened by overfishing. A bigger one would help the threatened yellowfin tuna population. The critically endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, which mates and lays eggs in the Galapagos reserve, might survive. If Ecuador wants to continue profiting from its marine riches, it will have to protect them."

Time was when investors believed that Peru's fast-growing economy was immune to its politics. That contention, always questionable, was tested almost to destruction this month. With the country suffering a power vacuum and on the brink of descending into violent chaos, on November 16th a shamefaced Congress chose Francisco Sagasti, a 76-year-old centrist academic, as the country's caretaker president. He is the fourth man to hold the top job since the last presidential election in 2016.
In Mr Sagasti Peru has come up with a winning ticket in its political lottery. His are the safest hands imaginable, but his task is not simple. It is to tackle the pandemic and the economic slump, both particularly severe in Peru, while steering the country through a general election due in April. His anointing followed the failure of a power grab by elements in Congress, who on November 9th voted by 105 to 19 to oust Martín Vizcarra, the president since 2018, on grounds of ""moral unfitness.
Power passed to Manuel Merino, the speaker of Congress. Rightly or wrongly, many Peruvians saw in this a plot to postpone the election and to advance murky private interests. Mr Merino named as prime minister Ántero FloresAráoz, a 78-year-old of the hard right who won just 0.4% of the vote in the 2016 presidential election. His law practice represents substandard private universities that are trying to overturn a university reform. His backers wanted to raid the treasury through populist giveaways.
This takeover prompted the biggest street protests in Peru for 20 years, mainly by young people and in defiance of a pandemic-related state of emergency. They met a brutal police response. Two protesters were killed and scores injured. With his gambit collapsing, Mr Merino resigned and promptly vanished. His putsch highlighted the way that political parties in Peru have become vehicles for private interests and for evading justice. Some legislators pay for places on party lists and expect a return. Although 68 of Congress's 130 members face criminal charges of various kinds, the legislature protects its own from prosecution.
This month's episode marked the climax of years of conflict that runs along several axes. One dates back to Alberto Fujimori, who ruled as an autocrat from 1990 to 2000. He defeated the Shining Path terrorist movement and reformed the economy, but his regime was corrupt. His daughter, Keiko, narrowly failed to win the election in 2016 because anti-fujimoristas of all stripes united against her. Her party used its majority in Congress to thwart the governing programme of the winner, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Another source of conflict involves corruption and its weaponisation. Mr Kuczynski resigned in 2018 to avoid impeachment over conflicts of interest. He remains under house arrest. His three predecessors are all accused: one is awaiting extradition from the United States, one killed himself and a third spent time in jail. Corruption is indeed systemic in Peru, and Peruvians know it. But the presumption of innocence and a sense of proportion have been lost. No leader has been tried. Ms Fujimori spent 16 months in jail for alleged campaignfinance violations. Prosecutors are seeking to drive her party out of existence. Mr Vizcarra was popular, despite a mediocre record and woeful management of the pandemic, because he championed the cause of anti-corruption. But the pretext for his summary ousting was evidence that he had been corrupt when he was a provincial governor (an allegation that he denies).
The third faultline is the battle between the executive and Congress, which Mr Vizcarra exacerbated. He tried to push through political reforms. One of the few that was approved unwisely barred legislators from consecutive terms. Last year he dissolved Congress in a battle over appointments to the Constitutional Tribunal. The new Congress, elected in January, is even less biddable. Since its members will serve for only 19 months and cannot stand next year, they have no incentive to behave decently.
More useful reforms are coming into effect for April's election, including a cull of minor parties and a bar on candidates charged with serious crimes. Several presidential hopefuls are populists, some of them dangerous ones. Those who are not will find it hard to assemble a reformist coalition in the next legislature. One thing is clear: the crowds of millennials out on the streets want a better democracy. Getting it will be a lot harder than chasing out Mr Merino."

ADDIS ABABA
Two weeks in, the conflict is spilling across borders as atrocities mount
""I SAW THE dust clouds covering the sky,"" Isays a young university lecturer, describing the bombing by a government warplane of a resort on the outskirts of Alamata, a small town in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray. In normal times Alamata is known for its beautiful green mountains. Now it is a battleground in Ethiopia's civil war, which broke out on November 4th between the federal government and Tigray's rulers, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (tplf).
As he fled towards Afar, a neighbouring state (see map on next page), the lecturer saw lorries carrying federal soldiers driving the other way. By the time the convoy reached Alamata, the town was almost deserted. Most Tigrayan civilians had already left and Tigrayan armed forces were retreating into the mountains.
On November 16th the federal government announced that its forces had captured Alamata, which is on Tigray's southeastern border, about 120km from the regional capital of Mekelle. It also appears to have captured a town farther north, as well as key territory in western Tigray. This suggests the Ethiopian army has made some important gains since it was ordered into action by Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to put down what he claimed was an armed revolt by the tplf. On November 17th Abiy said the battle was entering its ""final phase"" and that his troops were making brisk progress towards Mekelle.
But it is far too soon to suggest that these early victories herald a short or easily contained war. On the contrary, as the tplf has faced setbacks on its borders, it appears to have tried to widen the conflict, perhaps in a gamble that this will increase international pressure on the federal government to agree to peace talks, and that it will give the tplf cards to play once the negotiations start. On November 14th it fired rockets over the border at Asmara, the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.
The attack threatens to drag Eritrea into a conflict in Ethiopia barely two years after the two countries made peace. ""It was a legitimate target,"" says Debretsion Gebremichael, Tigray's president. He claims Ethiopian forces were using Asmara airport-which is probably true-and says Tigrayan forces are fending off 16 Eritrean divisions on several fronts.
The Eritrean government denies any involvement in Ethiopia's conflict. But few doubt that its president, Issaias Afwerki, would like to see the Tigrayans routed. Between 1998 and 2000 the newly independent Eritrea fought a bitter border war against Ethiopia, then dominated by the tplf, that cost perhaps 100,000 lives. Debretsion (as well as some eyewitnesses) claims that Eritrean soldiers in recent days have been involved in fighting near the border. At a minimum, retreating Ethiopian troops have been allowed to regroup on Eritrean soil before returning to battle.
The tplf has also struck inside Ethiopia, firing rockets at two airports in Amhara, the second-most-populous of Ethio- pia's ten ethnically based regional states. Thousands of Amhara militiamen, mostly farmers with rusty Kalashnikovs, have marched towards Tigray. They are fighting alongside the federal army to push Tigrayan forces out of disputed towns near the state border. The involvement of these regional militias in a country as divided as Ethiopia is a recipe for ethnic bloodletting.
Possibly hundreds of civilians, many of them Amharas, were hacked to death with machetes and knives in Mai Kadra, according to Amnesty International. Some witnesses said that forces loyal to the tplf were responsible for the killings, though Amnesty was unable to confirm this. Tigrayan refugees fleeing into Sudan told Reuters that they had been attacked by people from Amhara. As many as 36,000 people have sought refuge in Sudan.
Fears of an ethnic conflagration have been heightened by the harassment of Tigrayans in the national capital, Addis Ababa, and elsewhere. Many Tigrayans in the security services or civil service have been told not to come in to work. Possibly hundreds have been detained. Some 200-300 Tigrayan soldiers serving in Ethiopia's peacekeeping force in Somalia have been disarmed. People boarding international flights leaving Addis Ababa are being asked to show local ids, which typically reveal ethnicity. Tigrayans are turned back and told they may not leave.
Both sides to the conflict may have hoped it would be over quickly. After the tplf ordered its troops to fire the first shots, it described the war as an act of ""anticipatory self-defence"". Abiy's government insists it is involved in a policing operation aimed at ""enforcing the rule of law"". Although Ethiopian forces say they are marching on Mekelle, few think they will easily subdue Tigray, whose fighters may wage a guerrilla war from the hills.
Bad blood and a lack of trust between the two sides will hamper efforts to end the fighting through talks. The tplf, which called the shots in the federal government for almost 30 years, has yet to come to terms with its dethroning in 2018 after massive protests brought Abiy to power. After his appointment, Abiy sidelined the tplf and began removing Tigrayans from state institutions, in particular the army and intelligence agency.
Tensions worsened when the central government postponed elections earlier this year, citing covid-19. The tplf accused Abiy of flouting the constitution in order to stay in power and went ahead with its own regional election in September. The federal government deemed it illegal and slashed federal funding to the region. The tplf called this a ""declaration of war"".
Two weeks into the actual war, the tplf seems a little less keen on fighting it. Debretsion has called on the African Union and the un to condemn the Ethiopian offensive and says he wants talks. But he also insists on Abiy's head, saying: ""We will not negotiate with this criminal tyrant."" Abiy is no less intransigent and says he will not talk until the tplf has been defeated and disarmed. And so the fighting continues. *"

BETHLEHEM
Stealing animals is becoming more common-and more sophisticated
""Livestock theft has been around Lsince Biblical times, says Herkie Viljoen, a farmer on the outskirts of Bethlehem, a suitably named town in the Free State. But in recent years it has reached ungodly proportions. Standing next to a huge map of the province he points to small red circles with black dots that represent stolen animals. In some places it looks as if the farms are covered in poppy fields.
In South Africa 218,000 farm animals- cows, sheep or goats-were taken in the 12 months to March, up from 180,000 five years earlier. The total loss was worth about 900m rand ($60m) in each of the past two years, around twice as much as the annual black market value of poached rhino horn. Losses this year will probably be even higher, as the economic effects of the pandemic make it harder to earn a lawful living.
A few decades ago pilferage was ""for the pot. Today 87% of cases involve criminal syndicates, says Willie Clack of the University of South Africa. Gangs act differently in different places. In parts of the Free State and neighbouring KwaZulu Natal thieves often load cows onto lorries, then cross into Lesotho. Inside the mountain kingdom, which is encircled by South Africa, syndicates rebrand cattle before taking them back across the border, for sale at auction or to abattoirs. It is like laundering cars, but with cows instead of Porsches.
Livestock theft can be seen through a racial lens. The victims of the largest heists in the Free State are white Afrikaners who run big farms. Perhaps one-fifth of farm murders in the province-allegedly including the high-profile killing of Brendin Horner, a 21-year-old farm manager, on October 1st-are related to syndicates. Yet the victims in most cases of theft are black smallholders. As they own fewer animals, single incidents can ruin entire livelihoods.
Whites and blacks are both victims of a sclerotic criminal-justice system. There are dedicated Stock Theft Units within the police but they are siloed and poorly funded. A lack of arrests and prosecutions means there is ""no deterrence, argues Roy Jankielsohn, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance in the Free State. After the murder of Mr Horner, Bheki Cele, the national police minister, pledged that he would investigate livestock syndicates. ""I've seen the stock-theft figures-it's hell, he said, adding that if police were found taking bribes they would have to swap their blue uniforms for orange jumpsuits.
In the meantime farmers are protecting themselves. For as is often the case in South Africa, people who can afford to do so are finding private solutions to publicsector problems. Mr Viljoen's ""command centre, which is funded by 450 local farmers, uses 65,000 cctv cameras to look for rustlers. Farmers are also deploying drones and GPS-tagging to find purloined stock.
Yet such measures can only go so far. After visiting the command centre your correspondent heads to the Caledon river, which marks the border with Lesotho, passing two empty chairs where soldiers are meant to keep watch. Donkeys and cows quench their thirst while children joyfully splash back and forth from one country to another. ""You see! a young boy cries out. ""There's no border! *"

The latest chatter about Iranian plotting across the continent
""I'M NOT IN the business of making Ithreats,"" said Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, immediately before making one. When asked in September whether Iran was still considering retaliating for America's assassination in January of General Qassem Suleimani, Iran's most prominent military commander, Mr Zarif was clear: ""The books are not closed.""
Ever since President Donald Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Suleimani, Western spies have been alert to clues as to where and how Iran might retaliate. Some think the blow may fall in Africa, where Iran has spent years building up covert networks and where it faces little scrutiny from local governments.
Iran has a history of plotting on the continent-and failing. In 2013 police in Nigeria arrested three Lebanese men and uncovered an arms dump in Kano, the biggest city in the north. All three reportedly admitted to being members of Hizbullah, the Lebanese militia-cum-political-party that acts as an Iranian proxy. They said they were planning to attack the Israeli embassy and other Western targets.
A year earlier the police in Kenya arrested two Iranians who had hidden a stash of explosives at a golf course in Mombasa, accusing them of planning to attack Western targets. They were sentenced to 15 years in jail. More amateurish still were the attempts to free them. In 2016 two Iranians were sent to Nairobi to prepare a legal appeal. But they were caught planning an attack on Israel's embassy and expelled. Last year Kenyan police testified that Iran's ambassador had been swindled by two men who told him they could get the convicts released. The ambassador denies this.
The original bit of bungling in Kenya is thought to have been the work of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. But the Quds Force may be refining its playbook in Africa and turning to locals for help.
A report to the un Security Council from December accused Ismael Djidah, who was arrested in Chad in 2019, of having helped the Quds Force recruit and train terrorist cells in the Central African Republic (car), Chad and Sudan in order to attack Western, Saudi and Israeli targets. Among Mr Djidah's contacts, according to the report, was Michel Djotodia, a rebel leader who was briefly president of the car, from 2013 to 2014. The report accuses Mr Djotodia of meeting Quds Force officials in Iran in 2016 and agreeing to set up a terrorist network in exchange for Iran helping him reclaim power. Mr Djotodia's lawyer denies this.
A Western intelligence source says that police in Niger also recently arrested a man who admitted (under interrogation) to working for the Quds Force's Unit 400, which specialises in covert operations. The suspect said he was recruited while on a pilgrimage to Iran and that he had travelled to the country several times for weapons training. He said he helped build networks, gather intelligence or bribe politicians in the car, Chad, Eritrea, Gambia, Sudan and South Sudan. Iran also told him to seek mining licences in the car and Niger to help offset the impact of American sanctions on Iran and to fund covert operations.
Other current and former counter-terrorism officials from the West confirm this general pattern of activity. ""Iran is clearly trying to spread its wings as far as possible,"" says one. ""It makes sense for them to use locals who can work under the radar."" Are those locals working on a plot to retaliate for Suleimani? ""They are looking to generate headlines,"" says another intelligence source. ""They have chosen Africa because it's easy to operate there."""

Legions of people with mental-health problems are kept in chains
Sunday worshippers at the Holy Ghost Coptic Church of Africa, where services often last for hours, are used to the racket coming from the pews at the back. But it is not the sound of bells ringing or ecstatic chanting. Rather, the clanking comes from chains that shackle Father John Pesa's ""patients. In Kisumu, Kenya's third-biggest city, Father Pesa has built a reputation for ""spiritually healing the mentally ill.
Others have called it ""psychological torture. Rose Ojwang's husband sent her 17year-old son to Father Pesa after the boy began hallucinating and behaving strangely. Like other patients, he was shackled. He grew thin, says Rose, because the church does not feel obliged to feed its wards unless paid to do so. For two years the boy went without proper medical treatment.
Rose's grim story echoes the reporting of Human Rights Watch (hrw), an international watchdog, which found that the church had kept no fewer than 60 people in chains. Kenyan doctors say the practice is common. Their country is not alone. hrw's report, published in October, found evidence of shackling in 60 countries, from Brazil to Indonesia. It reckoned that hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from mental illness have at some point been chained or locked up. In countries where such illnesses are poorly understood, many sufferers never see doctors.
Kenya is anyway short of psychiatrists. In Africa, on average, there is less than one mental-health worker per 100,000 people, compared with 50 in Europe. Kenya has 0.19 psychiatrists per 100,000 people and one psychiatric hospital. At the local level, ""mental health is a mess and mostly forgotten, says Iregi Mwenja of the Psychiatric Disability Organisation, a Kenyan ngo.
""No family wants to shackle their child, says Kriti Sharma of hrw. But good care is expensive and patients are expected to recover in their community. Often people are ignorant of mental health issues, or fearful that the afflicted person may harm others.
But people seek out the services of Father Pesa for other reasons, too. Mental illness in Kenya, as in many parts of Africa, is often thought to be caused by evil spirits. Traditional healers are called in before health professionals. Father Pesa's church purports to flush out demons. It cites a miracle in the New Testament when Jesus drove demons out of a madman (who was shackled) and sent them into pigs. In Kenya's Somali region, which is mostly Muslim, many believe the mentally ill are possessed byjinns (supernatural creatures).
It is hard to shake off such deep-rooted beliefs. A health official who worked in Mathari Hospital, the country's sole psychiatric one, tells the story of her mentally ill brother. The last time he had a psychotic episode he chopped off three of his wife's fingers with a machete. Yet the doctor and her sister could not convince their mother that he needed medical care. ""Even as a mental-health specialist, I still don't have any influence, she laments.
There is some cause for hope. Kenya has signed up to a World Health Organisation initiative that promotes better care for the mentally ill. Politicians are striving to amend outdated laws, and the health ministry is wrangling for more power to monitor facilities where patients are shackled. A recent High Court ruling found that Rose's son had been tortured and ordered the church to pay him 500,000 Kenyan shillings ($4,590) in damages. But Father Pesa continues to host patients. *"

BEIRUT
The Arab world trains a lot of doctors, but not enough of them want to stay
For those with money, Lebanon's health-care system was once the envy of the Middle East. Private clinics and hospitals were staffed by doctors trained at top places in the West. Wealthy patients from across the Arab world jetted in for treatment. Today, though, it is the doctors getting on planes. One surgeon says his salary, paid in local currency, is worth about $200 a month-less than a dollar an hour. Another says his hospital was wrecked in the explosion on August 4th at Beirut's port. Both are applying for jobs abroad, joining a long exodus of Arab doctors.
The Middle East, like much of the northern hemisphere, is hunkering down as covid-19 cases climb. In Lebanon, where more than 80% of intensive-care beds are occupied, the government ordered most businesses to shut on November 14th. Tunisia has imposed a curfew and halted travel between regions. Other countries are considering similar measures. But the closures offer scant relief for doctors forced to fight the virus short-handed.
Though there is no universal standard for a well-staffed health-care system, the World Health Organisation suggests a minimum threshold of 45 skilled personnel-doctors, nurses and midwives-per 10,000 people. At least nine Arab states fall below that benchmark. In some the shortfall is particularly stark (see chart). Egypt had fewer than five doctors per 10,000 people in 2018, down from more than 11in 2014. The number of doctors in government hospitals, which serve the bulk of the population, fell by one-third during that period.
This is not for lack of talent. Arab universities produce plenty of doctors. In Egypt about 7,000 of them graduate each year-15% more than in America, adjusted for population. Careers in medicine offer prestige and stability. Competition for university places is fierce. (Nursing is a less desirable career, and many Arab states rely on nurses hired from abroad, a problem that is not unique to the Middle East.)
Once they graduate, though, many doctors are eager to leave. Money is the most obvious reason. A newly minted doctor in Egypt can expect to earn just 2,000-2,500 pounds ($128-160) a month. For a typical family, that is not even a subsistence wage: the average Egyptian household spends more than 4,000 pounds a month on living expenses, a figure that has soared since the pound was devalued in 2016. In Tunisia a specialist with decades of experience, working in a public hospital, may take home the equivalent of $15,000 a year. She could earn the same sum each month practising in a rich Gulf country.
Working conditions are better abroad, too. State hospitals in many Arab countries are notoriously crowded and short of equipment. Iraq has just 13 hospital beds per 10,000 people, compared with 22 in Saudi Arabia and 28 in Turkey, its neighbours to the south and north. The Iraqi health-care system was shattered by decades of war and sanctions, and successive governments have invested little in rebuilding it. In 2017 Iraq spent just $210 per person on health care, estimates the World Bank (the regional average was $459).
Egypt's constitution, approved in 2014 after a coup, committed the state to spending 3% of annual gdp on health care. That provision has gone ignored: spending in 2018 was just 1.4% of gdp. The constitution also promises free speech, which has not stopped police from arresting doctors who complain about the government's poor handling of covid-19; the disease has killed an estimated 200 medical staff. Underfunded hospitals cannot keep pace with a fast-growing population. In the three years after the constitution was approved, the number of hospital beds per 10,000 people fell by 8%, from 15.6 to 14.3.
In Lebanon an worsening economic crisis means even basic medical supplies are scarce. Chemists are running out of everything from blood-pressure pills to paracetamol. An estimated 400 Lebanese doctors, almost 3% of the total workforce, have left in the past year. The National Council of the Order of Physicians of Tunisia says 40% of its members practise outside their home country. In Egypt the figure is closer to 50%. The exodus has given rich countries a glut of doctors to hire. But it has left much of the Arab world short of them-just when they are needed most. *"

HERAT AND KABUL
As American forces leave, the Taliban seem keener on fighting than talking
To reach the front line in Afghanistan's civil war, you do not need to go far from the capital, Kabul. At a police outpost in Wardak province, about 20km outside the city on the main highway leading south, the Taliban's encroachment is evident. The outpost is little more than a ring of concrete blast walls perched on a hill overlooking the road. Around a dozen men, mostly dressed not in fatigues but in shalwar kameez and trainers, stand around. Some hold guns; most do not. A few look like teenagers. The 25-year-old in charge, Omedullah Khanjar, who commands six outposts along the highway, explains that, by day, things are mostly quiet. But at night, he says, the local Taliban shoot at the post from a nearby ridge. Unlike the cops, they have night-vision goggles and laser sights.
Not everything goes the insurgents' way, says Mr Khanjar. Recently they tried to blow up another outpost along the road, but the police got wind of the plan in advance. They retreated and then ambushed the fighters. On his phone, Mr Khanjar shows your correspondent a picture of the unexploded bomb and the phone the Taliban would have used to detonate it. But such victories are rare. The local Taliban live in the villages nearby, which they run as fiefs, unmolested by the troops. Mr Khanjar complains that the locals protect them, but he understands why. ""There is so much unemployment,"" he says. ""The government here provides no opportunities.""
In September negotiations started in Doha, the capital of Qatar, between the Taliban's political leadership, envoys from the Afghan government and leaders of civil society. The talks have been years in the making. They followed the conclusion in February of an agreement between the United States and the Taliban, under which America was to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan provided the Taliban cut all ties with international terrorists and started a sincere dialogue with the government on a ceasefire and a political settlement. The Afghan government did its part by releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners.
The sight of bearded, turbaned insurgents at a negotiating table sparked hope that 40 years of conflict might be coming to an end. But progress has been slow. The two sides are still arguing over the agenda and format of the talks. Big questions, such as what form of government Afghanistan should have, have not yet been broached.
Meanwhile, the number of American soldiers has fallen by more than half over the past year, from over 9,000 to around 4,500 now. Although the agreement foresaw a complete withdrawal only by June of next year, and only if the Taliban kept its side of the bargain, President Donald Trump is in a hurry. In October he said he wanted all American troops ""home by Christmas"". This week the Pentagon an- 1 ? nounced plans to cut the American force to 2,500 by the end of Mr Trump's term, in mid-January, over the objections of nato. Air strikes, which in 2019 reached the highest level in the two decades of the American intervention, have since been limited.
Yet instead of stepping back to foster dialogue, the Taliban have seized the opportunity to strengthen their position militarily. On October 27th the United Nations announced that civilian casualties have not fallen since the start of talks. In some parts of the country violence has escalated. In recent weeks the Taliban have launched attacks to try to take control of districts such as Panjwai, near the city of Kandahar (see map). On October 12th insurgents attacked Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, the first big assault on a city in over a year. The Afghan army retreated en masse, and the Taliban were eventually beaten back only by American air strikes- the first in months. Several hundred Afghan soldiers have died just in the past month (and probably a similar number of Taliban). The Taliban have also been assassinating more government officials.
Death and taxes
The sense of siege comes from more than the violence. The Taliban first took power in the 1990s, when Kandahari merchants paid them to provide security on the roads, for which they charged less than the warlords of the day. They seem to be applying that method again. At the edge of Kabul, the boss of a company that imports cooking gas says the security of his tankers has actually improved over the past year, because the Taliban control more roads. They charge 35,000 afghanis ($455) for every lorry travelling from Herat, on the Iranian border, to Kabul. ""In the past there were no Taliban taxes,"" he says. ""But they used to shoot us with rpgs [rocket-propelled grenades]. So we are happy with the taxes.""
In Taliban territory there is a shadow government. Per Muhammad, a 38-yearold farmer who lives in Zabul province, in the south-east, says that the 134 families in his village each pay a flat tax of 2,500 Pakistani rupees ($15) to the Taliban annually, as well as zakat, which is proportional to wealth. In exchange, they get access to the Taliban's brutal but efficient justice. Local Taliban leaders solve most disputes. Bigger ones-over land, say-go to the district chief. He does not have an office, says Mr Muhammad, but can be reached easily by phone. ""He is always with five mullahs and some armed Taliban."" They hear both sides' claims and make a decision immediately. ""Nobody can reject a ruling,"" he says, because it is enforced by armed men.
In Taliban-held territory, governmentfunded schools and clinics often continue to operate, says Ashley Jackson, a researcher at the Overseas Development Institute, a British think-tank, especially if local residents are keen on it. In some areas the Taliban insist that teachers, who are paid by the government, actually turn up to work. Some ngos operate in Taliban territory quite happily, working with ""ngo co-ordinators"" appointed by the local commander. ""It is the government we are afraid of,"" says one employee of an aid agency. ""With the Taliban, we can co-ordinate.""
This ambiguous arrangement means that boys, at least, can still get an education and the sick can receive health care in areas occupied by the Taliban. But it also helps to legitimise the insurgents, who take credit for providing services paid for by foreign donors. On October 14th Britain's Foreign Office had to remind ngos not to pay taxes to the Taliban.
What might happen next? Afghan government officials say that the Taliban think they have defeated America and see the talks in Doha as the negotiation of the government's surrender. Yet outright military victory is unlikely. The Afghan army is demoralised but not yet defeated. It has a new air force of its own. Trying to conquer big cities would be risky for the Taliban. Indeed, it could well bring America back into the war. The attack on Lashkar Gah, many in Kabul suspect, was not approved by the Taliban's political leadership in Doha.
The longer talks go on, however, the weaker the Afghan government gets. Attrition-from deaths, injuries and desertion-is sapping the army. In August Ashraf Ghani, the president, revealed that in the preceding six months over 12,000 soldiers, police and civilians had been killed by the Taliban. American estimates published last month showed that Afghan casualties increased by 5% in the third quarter of the year compared with a year earlier. The siege is accentuating political divisions within the Afghan state, says Timor Sharan, who served as a deputy minister until last year.
That heightens the likelihood that the talks in Doha will produce a deal that favours the Taliban, especially given Mr Trump's precipitous withdrawal. With their shadow government and growing assertiveness, the Taliban act as, and would like to be seen as, a government in waiting. In Doha they style themselves the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"", as they did when in power in the 1990s.
In urban Afghanistan, their return would be fiercely unpopular. Najia Sadat, a doctor who works at a government clinic in Herat, a thriving city near the Iranian border, says she is deeply concerned that the Taliban might return. She remembers their rule: ""We were not allowed to go out of the home."" Their fall made her training and career possible. The clinic where she works is supported by foreign donors, including usaid and International Rescue, a charity. If the Taliban came back, all that could disappear. It seems increasingly likely. *"

TOKYO
The pandemic is at last prompting doctors to go digital
AS COVID-19 SPREAD through Japan this spring, a doctor despaired. What appalled him was not the pace of infection, or a lack of protective equipment, but the archaic systems used to tabulate test results and so track the course of the epidemic. ""Even with corona, we're handwriting and faxing,"" he groaned on Twitter.
Japan has excellent health care. Life expectancy at birth is 85 years, the highest in the world. But doctors have been slow to embrace the efficiencies of information technology, despite Japan's reputation for technical wizardry. The oecd, a club mostly of rich countries, ranks it last among its members for its management and use of data in health care. A commission of experts convened by the Asia-Pacific Initiative, a think-tank in Tokyo, declared Japan's response to covid-19 a ""digital defeat"".
But the coronavirus is also providing a sharp spur for change. The new prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, has made digitising Japan the centrepiece of his economic agenda. The potential benefits are especially big in health care, because costs are rising as the population ages. Spending on health accounted for 11% gdp last year, up from 7% in 2000.
Telemedicine could help cut costs. But the Japan Medical Association (jma), a powerful lobby, has long opposed online consultations, citing concerns about safety and privacy. Resistance is in part generational. Japan's 327,000 doctors are ageing alongside their patients: nearly half are over 50. In small clinics, the average age is 60. Toyoda Goichiro of Medley, a telemedicine firm, says his colleagues often have to help new clients with digital basics, such as choosing computers and setting up Wi-Fi networks. But there is also an economic disincentive. As a government official puts it, ""There are people in the jma who are afraid of competition from telemedicine.""
In 2015 the government allowed telemedicine to treat a few conditions, albeit for less compensation and with more paperwork. Predictably, it did not take off: less than 1% of all medical institutions offered online consultations in 2018. But many restrictions on telemedicine were suspended in April because of the pandemic, sending patients and doctors flocking to their screens. The situation ""changed radically"", says Hara Seigo, the boss of micin, another telemedicine firm, which saw monthly registrations jump ten-fold. Government surveys show the share of institutions using telemedicine has risen to nearly 15% this year. Mr Suga hopes to make the changes permanent.
Mr Toyoda, who gave up a career in brain surgery to work in digital health care, hopes that wider adoption of telemedicine will also promote the use of electronic medical records. Japan's medical system is overwhelmingly paper-based, laments Tsuchiya Ryosuke, a former head of the National Cancer Centre Hospital. (Mr Tsuchiya uses a smartphone, but keeps ""a fax machine ready just in case"".) Only 42% of clinics have digitised their data on patients. Big hospitals do better: 85% keep at least some digital records. But information tends to sit on proprietary systems that are often incompatible with each other.
Linking and analysing those data could help to reduce costs. Duplicate procedures would be easier to avoid. The effectiveness of treatments could be measured. Having a clearer picture of patients' history is also essential if Japan is to shift from its fee-forservice system, whereby doctors get paid more for ordering more tests, to a system in which their pay is based on outcomes, as the health ministry wants. ""To fix problems, you need to have records,"" says Shibuya Kenji of King's College London. ""It's not about just abolishing stamps or faxes, it's about integrating data sources.""
For Koizumi Keigo, a doctor who serves two remote islands in Mie prefecture, the expansion of telemedicine has been a huge boon. Previously, when he was visiting one of the islands, patients on the other were left without a supervising physician. This year he began keeping tabs over video chat. Nurses hold up an iPad at patients' bedsides, while Bluetooth devices monitor blood pressure. That is enough to give him a sense of how his charges are doing. They are pleased with the extra attention, too. Now, he says, ""even the grandmas"" would like to see more doctors go online."

ISLAMABAD
The opposition takes on not just the government, but the army
ELECTIONS AMID the craggy splendour of Gilgit-Baltistan are usually of interest only to its residents-if them. The region at the northern tip of Pakistan is home to five of the 14 mountains in the world that exceed 8,000 metres, but contains only 1% of Pakistan's population. The pragmatic locals tend to vote for the party that runs the national government. Moreover, the local assembly has limited powers, since the region is not a province, but merely a territory, being part of Kashmir, which India and Pakistan both claim and which they divided by war in 1947.
It was odd, therefore, to see Pakistan's political elite campaigning furiously in Gilgit-Baltistan ahead of elections to the assembly on November 15 th. A new opposition alliance was hoping that the vote would prove its mettle. The prime minister, Imran Khan, was eager to show that his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (pti) retained public support.
To curry favour with the locals, Mr Khan announced at a campaign rally in the town of Gilgit on November 1st that his government would confer provincial status on the region. Maryam Nawaz, daughter of Mr Khan's predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, spent a week in the region trying to drum up support for his party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (pml-n). While there, she met her fellow dynast and leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (ppp), Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. So fierce was the scrum of national grandees, in fact, that a local court ordered many of them out of the region, saying they were breaking a rule against electioneering by senior officials.
The pml-n and the ppp are the mainstays of the new opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (pdm). Its goals include curbing the army's meddling in politics and sending Mr Khan packing. The two ambitions are related in the eyes of the pdm, since it accuses the army of helping to rig national elections in Mr Khan's favour in 2018.
Mr Sharif, who is in exile in London, has been giving incendiary speeches, accusing the army of operating as a ""state above the state"". Although this is true, Pakistani politicians tend not to say it, for fear that the army will arrange their downfall. Within Pakistan the pdm has held a series of rallies to demonstrate its support.
Widespread public anger at the rising cost of such staples as flour, sugar and tomatoes has given the pdm ammunition. At a rally in Gujranwala in the province of Punjab last month, it was this that seemed to exercise participants most, rather than the army's assertiveness. ""We are here to send Imran Khan home!"" shouted one of them, Muhammad Rafique, above the din of the protest. ""It's the price rises. Everyone is fed up.""
The vigour of these events appears to have rattled Mr Khan and the army. After a gathering in Karachi, Ms Nawaz's husband was arrested at the insistence of military officials. The local police chief was allegedly kidnapped by soldiers to force him to sign the warrant. The brazen nature of the army's intervention caused a public outcry. The army blamed ""overzealous"" officers.
But the pdm's leading lights make unlikely champions of democracy. Both the pml-n and the ppp have happily cosied up to the top brass to secure power in the past. Moreover, the army is unlikely to wilt in the face of a few rallies. ""Ultimately if there is a change, the momentum is not going to come so much from opposition pressure, as from a reassessment of the situation from within the military-security establishment,"" predicts Farzana Shaikh of Chatham House, a British think-tank.
As results rolled in from Gilgit-Baltistan's valleys, the pti appeared to have won the most seats. The other parties allege vote-rigging. The pdm has promised more rallies, culminating in a march across the country in January to call for the ousting of Mr Khan. It has yet to say whether there will be any stops in Gilgit-Baltistan."

DELHI
Hindu nationalists stir up groundless fears about Muslims
The organiser, an English-language weekly that is a mouthpiece for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the century-old flagship of India's swelling armada of Hindu nationalist groups, is in no doubt about the dangers of ""love jihad"". The luring of good Hindu girls into marriage and conversion is only the first phase of a broader Muslim plot, asserts a recent article. The second stage is rape jihad, ""a more unequivocal operation in which non-Muslim girls or women are raped and subsequently killed in many cases"". The third and final stage? Mass rape and`` ethnic cleansing.
Such ravings are not confined to the fringes of politics. Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu priest whose day job is running Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, proclaimed in October that those who practise ""love jihad"" should mend their ways or plan their funerals. So far five Indian states, all ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp), have enacted or are considering laws against love jihad. On November 17th, for instance, the government of Madhya Pradesh announced a ""Freedom of Religion"" bill. This would punish any form of matrimonial trickery for the purpose of conversion to Islam with five years in prison.
The spectre of ""our"" innocent womanhood being preyed upon by ""their"" boys is not new. Hindu nationalists depict the long period of Muslim rule as a prolonged violation of ""Mother India"". During national elections in 2014, the head of the bjp in Uttar Pradesh repeatedly asserted, entirely falsely, that Muslims, who make up 19% of the state's 225m people, were responsible for 99% of rapes. The Election Commission chastised another bjp leader, Amit Shah, for describing the vote as a chance for Hindus to avenge violations of their women. He is now India's home minister.
Replying to a parliamentary question in February, one of Mr Shah's deputies admitted that there were no known cases of ""love jihad"" in the state of Kerala, at least. Journalists with ndtv, a news channel, found that even in Uttar Pradesh, a police team created in August to crack down on ""love jihad"" had already dropped seven of the 14 cases it had opened, for lack of evidence. Yet Tanishq, a fancy jewellery brand owned by the Tata group, one of India's biggest firms, recently felt obliged to withdraw a television commercial portraying a happy interfaith marriage.
Indians rarely marry outside their caste, let alone their religion. The law that allows interfaith marriages is hedged with clauses that permit parents, bureaucrats and other outsiders to interfere. Courts have often seemed keener to uphold patriarchal ideas than to apply secular laws or give women freedom to choose. For India's 200m Muslims, it is another affront. As one lamented on Twitter: ""You can't criticise, you're antinational...You can't protest, you're terrorists. You can't fall in love, it's 'Jihad'."""

SEOUL
A proposed liberalisation riles both sides of the debate
The worst thing about it was the shame. ""I worried about how other people would judge me for doing something illegal, what my parents and my friends would say if they found out,"" says Kim Minkyoung, a 24-year-old student from Seoul who decided to terminate a pregnancy last year. The second-worst thing was paying: how to find $1,000 without prompting awkward questions.
Both these problems should soon be slightly less severe for women in South rea. If bill under consideration by the National Assembly becomes law, a woman will be able to obtain an abortion up to 14 weeks into a pregnancy with ease. From 15 to 24 weeks in, she will still be able to do so provided she attends a counselling session and waits 24 hours before making a final decision. Her reason for ending the pregnancy must also fall into one of a series of approved categories. This regime would greatly expand access to abortion and thus put an end to expensive illicit procedures. It has prompted an unsurprising backlash from anti-abortion activists, but feminists are not entirely happy either.
A new law became necessary last year after the constitutional court struck down the existing one, which allows abortion only in exceptional circumstances, such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Otherwise it stipulates prison terms or hefty fines for women seeking abortions and for doctors providing them. That is out of step with public opinion. Ten years ago more than half of South Koreans wanted to keep the old law. Nowadays nearly 60% of the population and more than three-quarters of women under the age of 45 want to scrap it. The authorities have hardly enforced it for years.
The court set a deadline of the end of this year for new legislation. But the bill is under attack from two sides. Feminists think it does not go far enough in its affirmation of women's rights. Opponents of abortion, meanwhile, claim it ""promotes"" the termination of pregnancies.
Kwon In-sook, a prominent feminist and lawmaker for the ruling Minjoo party, thinks the law falls short because it would continue to treat abortion as a criminal matter, retaining too much of the spirit of its predecessor. ""The old law was centred around the idea that abortion is a shameful, sinful thing,"" she says. ""The point of the new law is to put women's reproductive rights at the centre and treat abortion as the medical procedure that it is."" She worries that the ""socio-economic reasons"" for which abortions are permitted after 14 weeks are too vaguely defined, and that the counselling requirement, the 24 hours of ""thinking time"" and doctors' right to refuse to perform the procedure if they have personal qualms will provide scope for opponents of abortion to restrict access.
That is precisely what they are trying to do. ""The point is to balance the woman's right to choose with the fetus's right to live and to create an environment where women will feel safe in their choice to have the baby rather than an abortion,"" says Jeong Eun-yi, a 27-year-old activist who says she took up the cause after seeing a plastic model of a ten-week-old fetus. She would prefer to retain the old law, but says the bill has some potentially helpful features. ""The mandatory counselling session shouldn't be neutral, but push women to have the baby,"" she says, for instance by making women listen to the fetus's heartbeat or making them watch videos of abortions.
To feminists, the fact that such measures may be possible suggests that the government is pandering to conservatives. ""They have to focus more on the right to choose,"" says Kim Ye-eun, a 25-year-old student and activist. ""Keeping all these ancient provisions is a bad sign that they're not taking women's rights seriously.""
Ms Kwon, for her part, is concerned by the conservative backlash the bill has prompted. She worries that it may revive the authorities' appetite to enforce whatever restrictions remain in law. But she is glad that the debate has at least made women less ashamed to discuss their experience with abortion. *"

WHEN AMERICA, Australia, India and Japan met in 2007 for a ""quadrilateral dialogue"" on security matters, many bet the new grouping would fizzle, despite acquiring the much snappier title of ""the Quad"". Once non-aligned India, still suspicious of anything that smacked of an alliance, was non-committal, but in the end it was Australia, discomfited by China's prickly reaction, that was the first to break ranks. What has changed, says Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is that President Xi Jinping has since ""fundamentally altered the landscape"" by projecting Chinese power across Asia and the Pacific.
And so, since 2017, the Quad is back. All four members have seen their relationship with China deteriorate. Chinese incursions around islands that Japan controls but that China claims in the East China Sea have grown ever more frequent and forceful. Australia faces Chinese restrictions on all manner of exports, from punchy Barossa Shirazes to coking coal, following its call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a high-altitude border stand-off since the spring, resulting in the first fatal clashes in 45 years.
Last month, in Tokyo, foreign ministers from the Quad met for the second time. The public statements are anodyne. Who could object to a ""free, open, prosperous, rules-based and inclusive Indo-Pacific""? Behind the bromides, though, the spectre of China and its growing muscle is obvious.
Defence ties are strengthening fast among the four countries. This week their navies came together for the second phase of India's annual ""Malabar"" exercises-Australia's after a 13-year absence. In principle, the exercises have nothing to do with the Quad. In practice, they mark growing naval priorities among the four. Submarine-hunting drills were prominent. Chinese subs are extending their reach into the Indian Ocean.
Malabar is just the start. America and India have signed agreements on logistical support, encrypted communications and the exchange of geospatial intelligence, such as secret maps. America, Australia and Japan are all preparing to operate America's new F-35 fighter jet, allowing better integration among their forces. On November 17th Scott Morrison, Australia's prime minister, agreed to a defence pact with his Japanese counterpart, Suga Yoshihide, facilitating joint operations. Even India is ""veering towards some sort of an alliance relationship"" with the Quad countries, says Gurpreet Khurana, an Indian naval officer and think-tanker.
The Quad does not convince everyone. Nick Bisley of La Trobe University in Melbourne says the emphasis on a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" papers over big differences between the two halves of that vast region. In the western Pacific, China is challenging the longtime hegemon, the United States. In the Indian Ocean, the problem is not strong states but weak ones. Other critics say the Quad is too exclusive a club.
The Quad's defenders retort that it embodies the grammar of modern diplomacy. It is a compact bloc, rather than a sprawling multilateral organisation. Yet it is capable of broadening its agenda, from disaster relief to cyber-security to ensuring supply chains for critical minerals. And it is suitably elastic, for instance embracing New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam during the early weeks of the pandemic to discuss economic recovery. Advisers to Presidentelect Joe Biden have suggested that his administration will emphasise the formation of flexible coalitions of the willing on different issues, including pushing back against China. That fits with the Quad's catholic interests.
Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution in Washington predicts that, in security terms, the Quad countries will do ""a lot of the heavy lifting in Asia"". But even Mr Rudd, a supporter of the Quad, warns that anyone who thinks that these powers can ever be coequals to America ""has got rocks in their head"". This week America's navy secretary, Kenneth Braithwaite, called for a new American fleet based in the Indian Ocean, akin to the Seventh Fleet in Japan.
And China? At times, it claims that all the talk of a free and open Indo-Pacific is, as its foreign minister, Wang Yi, once put it, so much ocean spume. But if that is off the mark, so too is the claim of an Asian NATO-in-the-making. Instead, in the region's turbulent seas, the Quad, once adrift, is now shaping an increasingly confident course."

NEW YORK
For America's president-elect, handling China may be the biggest foreign-policy challenge. Two stories look at his likely response and those who will guide it
EARLY IN HIS campaign for the presidency, Joe Biden rejected the notion that China was much of a worry. He argued that no leader in the world would trade the challenges facing China for their own. ""China's going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,"" Mr Biden scoffed. ""I mean, you know, they're not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They're not competition for us."" He was speaking in May 2019. Tempered by his contest with Donald Trump, who tried to rally support by highlighting the threat posed by China, Mr Biden now avoids such words. But as president, will his policy towards China be very different from Mr Trump's? He has yet to spell out his plans, but he will throw fewer wild punches.
Mr Biden's political rivals attacked his remarks in Iowa City, accusing him of being naive about China. Even some of his own advisers were troubled. At the time, Mr Biden was still bragging about the many hours he had spent with Xi Jinping when he served as vice-president under Barack Obama (he is well remembered in Beijing for dropping in at a neighbourhood eatery in 2011-see picture, next page). He was also being less blunt about China's hard authoritarian turn under Mr Xi. Since Mr Trump became president in 2017, relations between China and America have become much more hostile. But Mr Biden seemed stuck in the mindset of the Obama administration, which described its co-operation with China as ""unprecedented"" in scope. During the campaign Mr Biden had to be ""reprogrammed"" on China, says an adviser.
It seems to have worked. Mr Biden has since called Mr Xi ""a thug"". He has criticised Mr Trump for praising Mr Xi (for example, during the early days of the covid-19 outbreak) and being indifferent towards, even tolerant of, China's human-rights abuses. In August his team accused China of ""genocide"" against ethnic Uyghurs in the far-western region of Xinjiang. Mr Biden finished his campaign sounding nothing like the candidate who started it or the administration he had once served. He was vowing to be ""tough on China"".
China may be wondering whether all this is bombast. Before Mr Trump's presidency, there had been a long tradition of candidates berating China on the campaign trail, only to tone down their rhetoric and try to keep relations on an even keel once in office. Mr Biden's remarks give him wriggle-room to do the same. Despite referring to China as America's ""biggest competitor"", he has not called it the biggest threat. That, he says, is Russia (although the Biden administration is expected to keep the label of ""strategic competitor"" used under Mr Trump to describe China). Advisers to Mr Biden's team say there will be ""no reset"" in the relationship. But the president-elect does talk about co-operation with China on issues such as climate change and global health, which Mr Trump eschewed.
What can be discerned of Mr Biden's China policy looks like an amalgam of Mr Trump's and Mr Obama's: a Trumpian wariness of China combined with a preference 1 for caution in handling strategic matters. He will be constrained by a Congress that has become far more hostile to China in recent years. A Senate that may remain in Republican control will restrict his freedom to appoint people whom hawks fear will favour more engagement with China (see next article). Public opinion may affect his policy, too-negative views of China have reached an historic high.
Of the many disputes between China and America that have grown more fraught under Mr Trump, trade is among the most bitterly contested. Mr Biden will inherit a smouldering trade war with China that was launched by Mr Trump in a vain attempt to reduce a soaring bilateral trade deficit. Unlike Mr Trump, America's leader-in-waiting is no fan of using tariffs to achieve such goals. But he is unlikely to move swiftly to dismantle Mr Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods-even though they are, in effect, a tax that is mostly paid by American consumers. Some of Mr Biden's advisers hope that retaining them, at least for now, will give America leverage in negotiations with China over trade and other matters.
In the Obama era, Mr Biden supported efforts to forge a trade deal among 12 countries, including America, around the Pacific-hoping it would eventually draw in China and bind it to Western trading norms. Mr Trump withdrew from that project. There is little chance that Mr Biden will resume interest in it. Winning approval from the Senate for multilateral trade pacts would be daunting, if not impossible.
Avoiding a hot war with China will also be a priority for Mr Biden. In recent months the China has stepped up exercises in the Taiwan Strait and sent fighter jets on numerous sorties into Taiwanese airspace. Mr Biden will continue arms sales to Taiwan, which have picked up pace under Mr Trump. But he may scale back symbolic shows of support, such as high-level trips to Taiwan by cabinet members (in August Alex Azar, the health secretary, became the highest-ranking American to visit the island since America severed official ties with it in 1979). Some of Mr Biden's advisers see these as needlessly provocative.
But Mr Biden is likely to retain some of Mr Trump's toughest measures against China related to national security. He will persist with efforts to strangle Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant that America regards as a security threat, by keeping Trump-era restrictions on doing business with the firm (see Briefing). Mr Biden will stress the need for America to keep ahead of China in technology. ""Decoupling"" in high-tech areas will remain the trend. This may involve government support for making semiconductors in America to avoid reliance on ones made in China.
Despite its disregard for multilateral forums, the Trump administration did try to build the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a group of four China-sceptic countries- America, Australia, India and Japan-into something sturdier. A military exercise involving all four members of the club took place this month in the Bay of Bengal. Mr Biden can be expected to continue efforts to beef up the Quad, as it is known (see Banyan). He will also maintain ""freedom of navigation"" patrols by the American armed forces in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Mr Obama was reticent about these, but they became routine under Mr Trump. Mr Biden will assure China's neighbours that America will be active in Asia; some allied diplomats in the region had grumbled that Mr Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia was too half-hearted.
Making values great again
Unlike Mr Trump, Mr Biden is expected to take a personal interest in the challenge posed by human-rights abuses in China, including repression in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. He may make more effort to contest China's influence in the un, where Mr Xi has sought to insulate himself from criticism of his human-rights record. Mr Biden is likely to maintain sanctions on China imposed by the Trump administration, including those on officials and companies deemed complicit in violating human rights. Soon after taking over he may stage an international ""Summit for Democracy"" to make his values clear.
But the next president will avoid giving the kind of fiery ideological speeches favoured by the likes of Mike Pompeo, Mr Trump's secretary of state, and William Barr, his attorney-general, who have described the Chinese Communist Party as an existential threat to the free world. Such rhetoric does not mesh well with his belief that America can still co-operate with China in some areas.
Mr Biden will abandon aspects of Mr Trump's China policy that he views as harmful to openness and tolerance. He may remove visa-related impediments, introduced by the Trump administration, to study in America by people from China. Mr Biden believes that more foreigners should be recruited to American campuses, and that America gains from their presence. Investigations will continue into suspected espionage involving Chinese researchers, but Mr Biden's administration may tone down Trumpian rhetoric that instilled fears among ethnic Chinese living in America of a ""red scare"" fuelled, in part, by racial hostility towards them.
Mr Biden will certainly avoid Mr Trump's use of racially charged language to describe covid-19's links with China. He can also be expected to rejoin the World Health Organisation and try to resume the stationing in China of specialists from America's Centres for Disease Control, who used to work with their Chinese counterparts on public health.
In the battle against climate change, Mr Biden may seek to persuade China to stop building carbon-belching projects such as coal-fired power plants in other countries. Such efforts will be made easier by America's rejoining, under Mr Biden, of the Paris agreement on climate change. In September Mr Xi announced a goal of reaching netzero carbon emissions by 2060. Some climate experts say Mr Biden should announce an even more ambitious climate target, and encourage a race with China to develop a green economy. That would mesh well with what Mr Biden's advisers believe should be a pillar of his China strategy-strengthening America itself, including by spending more government money on renewable energy. But the Senate, if it remains in Republican control, could frustrate such ambitions.
It is not only Republicans who will limit Mr Biden's room for manoeuvre on China. Much of the machinery of government- from the Commerce Department to intelligence agencies-has been recalibrated in response to China's growing challenge, with more staff and energy focused on the country and its transgressions than ever before. New laws, sanctions and other policies specifically targeting China are in place. This helps to keep China at the forefront of political debate and makes it more difficult for leaders to turn a blind eye to the Communist Party's bad behaviour. ""It's very different from the past when a new president came in and could very quickly if they wanted make significant changes,"" says Bonnie Glaser of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank.
In keeping with the new mood, Mr Biden is expected to send early signals that he 1 intends to stand firm against China. Advisers suggest that he wait longer than usual to take a congratulatory call from Mr Xi, and not fall for any language Mr Xi may use to suggest a new framework for the relationship. Initially, at least, Mr Biden will focus on domestic issues like covid-19 and the economy, as well as on strengthening ties with allies. He will want their support when he turns his attention China-wards.
Mr Xi will surely look for a chance to test Mr Biden's mettle. In the build-up to a crucial Communist Party gathering in 2022, he will not wish to appear weak. How Mr Biden responds to any provocation will depend, in part, on the advice he receives from his senior officials. Some of those whom he is expected to pick as his national-security advisers are veterans of the Obama administration who shied away from confrontation with China. Others believe in more muscular responses to its increasingly assertive behaviour, including a clearer commitment by America to defend Taiwan against any Chinese attack. As vicepresident Mr Biden displayed caution about the use of American force. In his dealings with China, the risk of a dysfunctional relationship turning into a violent one will loom large in his calculations."

NEW YORK
Veterans of the Obama administration will shape Joe Biden's China policy. They are far less sanguine about China's rise than they used to be
Seven years ago Susan Rice, then Barack Obama's national security adviser, said America wanted ""a new model of major power relations"" with China. Her words echoed a term used by China's president, Xi Jinping-""a new type of great-power relations""-to describe what he hoped would be a more accommodating American view of his country. Within a year Ms Rice (pictured, with Joe Biden) and her boss stopped using the phrase as it became ever more clear that Mr Xi had no plans to be accommodating himself. Now Ms Rice and her then deputy, Antony Blinken, are among leading contenders to become secretary of state under Joe Biden, America's next president. Some of Mr Obama's most trusted advisers on China are looking forward to a second chance. This time they have few, if any, illusions about China's strongman.
As the president-elect selects people for his national-security team and other key China-related jobs, he will draw heavily from Mr Obama's former staff. Most of those likely to be chosen come from a traditional school of foreign policy that places trust in alliances, treaties and multilateral institutions. Their breed is very different from that of Mr Trump's China team.
Fears that Republicans may retain control of the Senate (to be decided in January by two special elections in Georgia) could dim Ms Rice's prospects. She is widely disliked among Republicans. Some of them see her as partly to blame for what they view as the failings of Mr Obama's China policy. Republican China hawks would be happier to see the job go to Mr Blinken, a genial, well-liked longtime aide to Mr Biden. Another candidate less controversial than Ms Rice is Christopher Coons, a centrist Democratic senator from Mr Biden's home state of Delaware.
Advisers to Mr Biden say that the views on China of all three of these potential choices for secretary of state have hardened in the past two years, as have those of most other members of Washington's foreign-policy establishment. Last year Ms Rice spoke tough about Huawei, urging Canada to keep the telecoms giant out of its 5G networks. Mr Blinken has said that some assumptions about engagement with China have turned out to be wrong. But he has also said that, as a believer in international agreements like arms control and climate treaties, there is scope for co-operation.
If Mr Blinken does not get the job at the State Department, he would probably serve as national security adviser, a White House role that would suit him well given his close work with Mr Biden over the years. It is also possible that Ms Rice may be offered the national-security role as a consolation, because it does not require Senate approval. It is unclear whether she would be willing to take a post that she has already held.
Obama veterans are sure to get other senior jobs. Michele Flournoy, an undersecretary of defence under Mr Obama, is likely to lead the Pentagon. In an article in June in Foreign Affairs she said America needed to do more to deter China, such as by beefing up military capability and sending clear signals of American support for regional allies. Ely Ratner, one of the most respected China hawks in the Democratic ranks, may serve Ms Flournoy as an assistant secretary.
For the post of treasury secretary Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors and a former undersecretary at the Treasury Department, is a front-runner (see Free exchange). A former Obama official describes her as a ""silent hawk"" on China. (Her husband, Kurt Campbell, helped guide China policy as assistant secretary of state for East Asia during Mr Obama's first term.)
A department that has become increasingly influential on China is Commerce, which oversees export controls and an ""entity list"" of blacklisted companies-tools that the Trump administration has employed with gusto against Chinese tech firms. Some tech-industry leaders, eyeing the market in China, want someone to lead the department who will loosen the screws a bit. Meg Whitman, a former ceo of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a giant tech firm with dealings in China, is one of several rumoured candidates who would please Silicon Valley titans. Kevin Wolf, who worked on export controls under Mr Obama and is seen (by China hawks, at least) as friendly to the tech industry, has been mentioned as a contender for another powerful role at Commerce: head of the Bureau of Industry and Security. Those who fill these posts may have as much impact on China policy as other senior appointees.
It is far less certain who will fill lowerprofile positions. But these can also be crucial in shaping China policy. Matthew Pottinger, Mr Trump's deputy national security adviser, started in 2017 as senior director for Asia, a couple of rungs below Ms Rice's old job. Mr Pottinger played a big part in steering the administration's hard turn on the Communist Party. His successor in the Asia role could be someone like Mr Ratner (if he does not serve at the Pentagon). The choice will necessarily come later than the selection of principals in the national-security team. But it could matter a lot. *"

OPTIMISTS ABOUT American relations with China should consider the following scenario. At some point in early 2021, perhaps as President Joe Biden is sworn into office, hand on Bible, North Korea sees an incentive in testing a potent new weapon. In a worst case, that may mean launching one of the monstrous intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) that it unveiled at a parade in Pyongyang in October. Each may be able to carry enough nuclear warheads to overwhelm anti-missile defence systems.
The military implications of an icbm test would be bad. The political fallout would be worse. With its first breath China, North Korea's indispensable patron and protector, may condemn the regime in Pyongyang for a reckless act, carried out in defiance of resolutions by the un Security Council. China may note that it is obliged to enforce un sanctions, hinting at a clampdown on (currently rampant) Chinese smuggling of oil into North Korea, and sanctions-busting by North Korea with its exports of coal and the sale of fishing rights. Alas, in its next breath China would probably opine that-if North Korea feels a need to test advanced weapons, or simply to attract the world's attention-America has itself to blame. For it was America, China would insist, that churlishly rejected peace offers made by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, during his meetings with Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019. Worse, should Mr Biden urge China's president, Xi Jinping, to join America in imposing crippling new sanctions on North Korea unless it abandons nuclear weapons, the near-consensus among Chinese scholars and foreign diplomats in Beijing is that Mr Xi will refuse.
China and America disagree about so much, nowadays, that divergent views of North Korea may seem an afterthought. But seen from Beijing, this gulf in understanding over Korea is unusually revealing, and troubling. In essence, Mr Kim's nuclear ambitions are a nuisance for China. But in the risk-calculations of Chinese leaders, the collapse of the grim, impoverished North Korean regime is a far more alarming prospect. It could lead to a rapid, chaotic reunification with South Korea, an advanced democracy and treaty ally of America which keeps more than 20,000 troops there. Still more cynically, as an Asian diplomat puts it, China does not think that it is the target of North Korea's nukes.
Chinese officials stress the generosity of North Korea's moves to reduce tensions since the crisis of late 2017 and early 2018. That flare-up involved repeated missile tests and nuclear blasts by the Kim regime, prompting Mr Trump first to threaten to rain ""fire and fury"" on North Korea, and then to pivot abruptly to an approach based on personal diplomacy with Mr Kim. China notes that North Korea returned the remains of long-lost American servicemen, destroyed some nuclear test facilities and that it has refrained from testing long-range missiles and nuclear devices since 2018.
No matter that American officials call North Korea's offers inadequate. China blames America for a diplomatic stalemate since the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi ended without a deal in February 2019. This is more than a talking point, insists Li Nan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research institute. Chinese leaders ""really believe that because of cold-war thinking, the us never trusted North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons,"" so never dropped any sanctions in response to North Korean concessions, he says. Before fears of covid-19 prompted North Korea to seal its borders, Mr Li was a frequent, well-connected visitor to Pyongyang. He is pessimistic about substantive SinoAmerican co-operation during any fresh Korean crisis. ""America can't make concessions to North Korea, and China can't put more pressure on North Korea,"" is his blunt assessment.
Hardline Chinese nationalists see a conspiracy in America's rejection of North Korean demands. These include dropping sanctions and ending American military exercises with South Korea that Mr Trump calls expensive and provocative, and has suspended. Some Chinese scholars write that their country must face the reality of a nuclear-armed North Korea and balance its geopolitical interests accordingly, says Zhao Tong, a disarmament expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing. To such scholars, progress towards peace is blocked by America's refusal to offer North Korea economic and security incentives. Their explanation is that America does not want to leave the peninsula ""because the long-term us goal is to contain China,"" reports Mr Zhao.
American experts on Korea are just as sceptical about China's motives. Jung Pak is a former cia analyst in Mr Biden's transition team. Expressing her own views rather than the next administration's, she writes in a forthcoming paper for the East Asia Institute, a Seoul-based think-tank, that China sees chances to advance its goal of regional dominance in deadlocked American talks with North Korea. It sees similar potential gains from America's disputes with the South (Mr Trump told it to pay five times more towards the cost of American garrisons). China's assertiveness may ""embolden, not rein in, Kim Jong Un"", worries Ms Pak.
Pausing tests: useful but not the same as denuclearisation
Until June this year, Markus Garlauskas was America's national intelligence officer for North Korea. ""We have reached a natural limit in terms of what we can get out of China on North Korea,"" says Mr Garlauskas, now with the Atlantic Council, a think-tank. Pressing North Korea to stop testing its most dangerous weapons is probably the most that China will do, he suggests by telephone from Washington. A moratorium on tests is not nothing: a new model of icbm is not credible until it has flown. But pausing tests alone is a thin basis for co-operation with China.
North Korea will provoke America's next president, triggering domestic headaches for Mr Biden as Republicans call him weak on China and North Korea, which they surely will (forgetting Mr Trump's talk of love letters from Mr Kim). That crisis will in turn test America's ties with China. The results will not be cheering."

CHICAGO AND SAO PAULO
Covid-19 has shone a light on profound racial disparities in health and the complexity of their causes
""I stopped counting how many people 11 knew from my community,"" says Marina Del Rios, a doctor in an emergency ward in Chicago, of the flood of desperately ill covid-19 patients. Infection rates among Latinos in Chicago are double those of the city's African-Americans and triple those of whites. Of the city's 15 worst-affected zip codes, 11 are predominantly Latino.
In the few countries that collect and publish such data, it is clear that covid-19 has hit ethnic minorities harder than whites. That is in part because the disease disproportionately affects those in jobs, such as security guards and supermarket staff, where ethnic minorities are over-represented. But it is also because of racial disparities in health. Doctors have long argued about the extent to which those disparities are the result of broader inequalities compared with other factors, such as racism or biology. Covid-19 has thrown those questions into stark relief.
Health outcomes differ for racial and ethnic groups. 1n Brazil people of colour can expect to live three years fewer than white people. 1n America, where the blackwhite health gap is at its narrowest ever, black men still live for four-and-a-half fewer years than their white counterparts. Covid-19 has magnified such differences.
It has hit ethnic minorities particularly hard. 1n Britain all non-white groups (except Chinese women) have been more likely to contract and to die from covid-19 than whites. Trends are similar in America. Disparities are worst among the working-age population. In America a 40-year-old Hispanic person is 12 times as likely to die as a 40-year-old white person, according to the 1nstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Black Americans are nine times as likely to do so.
America and Britain are unusual in collecting and publishing detailed data about health and race or ethnicity. Some countries, such as France, outlaw it. Nonetheless a similar picture is emerging elsewhere. In Sāo Paulo, Brazil's richest state, black people under the age of 20 are twice as likely to die from covid-19 than their white counterparts. Sweden tallied deaths early in its epidemic and found that those born abroad were several times more likely to die than those born in Sweden.
Professor Sir Michael Marmot, an epidemiologist, writes about how people's health is determined by social factors. The debate about covid-19 reminds him of 19thcentury America, when northern doctors attributed higher rates of tuberculosis among black patients to poverty; southern doctors thought it was genes. ""When social conditions improved, tb plummeted in both groups,"" he says, ""and we learnt that it was overwhelmingly social.""
How rich or well educated people are or what jobs they do is a strong predictor of health. 1t is the primary driver of racial health inequities. People who suffer more deprivation, which minorities often do, have poorer health and shorter lives. ""There's long been an excessive focus in America on health care as the determinant of health,"" says Lisa Angeline Cooper, who researches racial health disparities at Johns Hopkins University.
West Garfield Park is one of the poorest, fastest-depopulating neighbourhoods of Chicago. Many houses, shops and factories are boarded up or abandoned. Fear of gun violence keeps children indoors. Africa Food and Liquor and Quick Food Mart offer few fresh vegetables-mostly cabbage- but shelves stacked with sweets, fizzy drinks and booze. People assume most black deaths in Chicago are the result of gun violence, but the primary cause of early death in neighbourhoods like these is heart disease, says David Ansell, a doctor at Rush University Medical Centre. Across America black men under 50 are twice as likely as white men to die of heart disease.
In Brazil skin colour is a good proxy for social factors too, says Fatima Marinho, an epidemiologist in Sāo Paulo. Sandra Maria da Silva Costa lives in a favela in Rio. She is 46 ""but I look 56."" Even before catching covid-19 in April, she suffered from a litany of health problems, including in her lungs. Her lungs worsened in September when, after stealing some meat and milk, she spent a month in prison, where she received no health care. Both her parents died last year. They never spoke about racism or exclusion, says Ms da Silva Costa; they simply accepted that they would not get proper health care. ""We're black, poor and jobless,"" she says. ""We're invisible.""
Wealth and education matter even in countries where people are treated more fairly. People who live in the areas of England and Wales that count among the mostdeprived 10% are twice as likely to die of covid-19 as those in the least-deprived areas. All ethnic minorities except Indians and Chinese are more likely to live in such places than whites. Pakistanis are more than three times as likely as white Britons to do so and Bangladeshis twice as likely.
Two things help explain the disproportionate impact of covid-19 on ethnic minorities. First, and most important, they are more likely to be exposed to the virus. In many Western countries minorities are more likely to work in jobs that put them into regular and close contact with the public, increasing their risk of infection. They are also more likely to live in cities, in deprived areas and in crowded, multigenerational homes, all of which increase their exposure. Second, when they catch the virus they are more likely to die of it than white people. That is probably because pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, which increase the risk of dying of covid-19, are more common among ethnic minorities.
A virus that discriminates
Such factors go a long way to explaining the disproportionate impact of covid-19 on non-white people in Britain, according to the country's Office for National Statistics. But not entirely. Bangladeshi men are three-and-a-half times more at risk of dying of covid-19 than white men of the same age. After controlling for geography (this group is twice as likely to live in densely populated areas), this ratio fell to 2.3. After controlling for factors such as poverty and exposure at work, it fell to 1.9. But even after including self-reported health concerns and pre-existing conditions, their risk was still almost one-and-a-half times that of white men of the same age (see chart).
Even Sir Michael concedes that it is increasingly clear that socioeconomic conditions do not fully explain racial disparities in health. In a recent report he and colleagues found that in several countries in the Americas, such as Colombia and Brazil, the worse health of black people cannot fully be explained by conventional socioeconomic measures. The differences are greater for men than women in America. For black American women the life expectancy gap narrows significantly when controlling for education and income. ""But for men a sizeable unexplained gap remains,"" says Sir Michael. Some of that disparity can be explained by high homicide rates among black American men. They are also more likely to die of aids (though this affects relatively few men, it kills them when they are young and so has a significant impact on average life expectancy). But that does not fully explain the gap.
Puzzling patterns
Cancer is a good example of a disease the prevalence of which cannot be explained by socioeconomic factors alone. In Britain black people have much higher rates of stomach and prostate cancer than other groups. Asian women are more likely than any group to contract mouth cancer. South Asian women are the least likely to get cervical cancer. White Britons have the highest rates of cancer overall. Understanding why certain groups are more likely to get different cancers hints at the complex interaction of social factors and biology that may be at work.
People's risk of dying of particular diseases tends to reflect underlying conditions that make them more vulnerable, their access to a doctor or the treatment they will receive. Black women in America are no more likely than white women to get breast cancer but much more likely to die from it. Ethnic minorities made up 11% of covid-19 hospital admissions in Britain in May but 36% of those receiving intensive care. Hospitalised South Asians were the group least likely to survive, whereas there was no difference between black and white people, according to one study.
Disparities exist in other areas, too. Few things predict more accurately whether a woman will survive childbirth than the colour of her skin. In America black women are three times, and native Americans two-and-a-half times, as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as white women. Even after controlling for education, differences persist. Covid-19 could compound this. In Britain's first wave 55% of pregnant women hospitalised with the virus were from black and other ethnic-minority groups (they represent 14% of the population). In Brazil black pregnant women hospitalised with covid-19 have been around twice as likely to die as white ones.
What might explain such gaps? First, pre-existing conditions. In the rich world the leading cause of death related to childbirth is heart disease, responsible for over a third of deaths. Prevalence is higher among black women. Second, access. In America 89% of white women receive prenatal care in their first trimester, compared with 75% of black women. This means missed opportunities for early diagnosis of problems in pregnancy. Third, unequal treatment. In some Brazilian hospitals black and brown women are treated as though they are of lesser value, says Dr Marinho.
Many indigenous people in Brazil are reluctant to go to hospital at all. Previous interactions and ""years of delays [in getting hospital appointments] generated a lack of trust, a lack of hope,"" explains Elivar Karitiana, of the Karitiana tribe, who works for the indigenous health-care system in the Amazonian state of Rondônia. When his uncle, a healthy 56-year-old, became very ill with covid-19, he ended up in hospital in Porto Velho, the state capital and died. Villagers insisted ""the doctors killed him"" by putting in a breathing tube, says Mr Karitiana. He now worries about a second wave in the village. Since his uncle's ordeal the tribe has become even more sceptical.
A problem everywhere
Even Britain, where health care is free, has disparities. Some groups make less use of programmes meant to catch health problems before they become more serious. Several studies have shown that women from ethnic minorities in Britain make less use of cervical screening than white women. They were more likely than white women to say (wrongly) that they were not at risk or to say they were scared of what might be found, or embarrassed or fearful of being seen by a male doctor.
Governments are belatedly working to ensure that efforts to stop covid-19 reach all people: putting testing centres in places particular groups will visit, for example, such as churches. At the start of the pandemic Latinos in Chicago, many undocumented migrants, made less use of testing centres than others because they were afraid of the authorities who ran them.
Awareness of cultural barriers will be crucial when rolling out covid-19 vaccines. Culture Care, in California, matches black patients with black medics. An nber study in 2018 found that black men seen by black doctors consented to more invasive preventive screening procedures (blood tests, for example, and injections), and more of them, than those seen by non-black ones.
But there is also evidence, mostly from America (which has good data), that people of colour simply receive worse medical care. When a black man enters a hospital with a heart attack he is about a third less likely than a white man entering a similar hospital with similar symptoms to receive a treatment called balloon angioplasty within 90 minutes (this timing is a key quality indicator). Studies show that black patients get less pain medication too (so much so that it is thought to have helped keep opioid addiction rates among black Americans well below those of whites).
Pain in black people is underestimated compared with pain in white people. An experiment by the University of Virginia found that around half of a sample of white medical students held some false beliefs about biological differences (that black people have thicker skin, for example). Such views were associated with underestimating and undertreating black pain.
New research looks at the health effects of chronic exposure to discrimination. The idea is that living in a racist society increases stress hormones for minorities and damages their health. Living in a racist environment can harm the health of all black people, even those who do not directly experience racism, says Delan Devakumar, at the Institute of Global Health at University College London. ""This is akin to other environmental risk factors for health, such as high levels of air pollution,"" he adds.
And yet all this does not fully explain the racial disparities seen with covid-19. This is apparent from work done using the Biobank data set, an exceptionally detailed medical database of the lives and health of hundreds of thousands of British people. When using these data to account for socioeconomic status, lifestyle, vitamin D levels and pre-existing health disparities, they still do not explain all the differences.
Known unknowns
Some are now calling for a deeper look into the possible genetic contributions to covid-19-related health disparities. Naomi Allen, Biobank's chief scientist, says population-level differences in the genetics of the immune response to sars-cov-2 might increase the risk of hospitalisation and death. Asking questions about genetic factors, though, is tricky. Some fear they will distract from the big and important socioeconomic factors. Others think they are a red herring because the races that humans recognise are socially determined, rather than having real genetic underpinnings.
And yet it is true that different populations from different environments and places can have different variants of the same genes. In malaria-ridden parts of the world, natural selection has led to an increased prevalence of a gene that causes blood cells to form an odd sickle shape (which helps explain why over 90% of sufferers of sickle-cell disease in America are black). This protects against malaria.
Evolution has also tinkered with immunity. In some areas, presumably where ancestral levels of pathogens were higher, the immune system is more reactive. That is useful when fighting off illness, but having an overactive inflammatory system can also trigger chronic troubles such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These then put people at greater risk for other health conditions. There is evidence that those of African ancestry have a stronger inflammatory response than Europeans.
A set of genes inherited from Neanderthals influences which patients get severe covid-19. They are found throughout European populations at a low frequency. They are, though, particularly prevalent in South Asia. Bangladeshis carry the highest frequencies of these genes, a factor worth exploring when considering why Britons of Bangladeshi origin have had such high death rates of covid-19. These genes are absent in black people-who have a high infection risk, too. This demonstrates just how multifactorial disease can be.
According to research conducted by Raj Chetty, an economist, and others, the lifeexpectancy gap between rich and poor Americans has been rising even as the racial one has been declining. This suggests that in America race is becoming a poorer predictor of health outcomes than income or deprivation. The disparities change. But the world cannot stop counting. *"

KUNSHAN
Cross-strait commercial ties helped build China's economy. They are beginning to fray
Hundreds of jobseekers lined up outside a factory gate on a recent autumn morning. Uni-Royal, a Taiwanese maker of electronic components for such brands as Samsung and Toshiba, was looking for extra help at its plant in Kunshan, an hour's drive west of Shanghai. New factory hands could earn 4,000 yuan ($610) a month, double the local minimum wage. Kunshan is dotted with hundreds of Taiwanese manufacturers like Uni-Royal. More than 100,000 Taiwanese call Kunshan home.
""Little Taipei"", as Kunshan is known, illustrates a broader phenomenon. Exact estimates vary, but as many as 1.2m Taiwanese, or 5% of Taiwan's population, are reckoned to live in China-many of them business folk. Taiwan Inc has not let fraught political relations with China, which views the island as part of its territory, get in the way of business. Taiwanese companies have invested $i90bn in Chinese operations over the past three decades. Foxconn, a giant Taiwanese contract manufacturer of electronics for Apple and other gadget-makers, employs 1m workers in China, more than any other private enterprise in the country.
As the West grows increasingly suspicious of communist China's rise-a trend that America's next president, Joe Biden, may slow but not reverse-Beijing seems keener than ever to bolster cross-strait commercial bonds. It sees Taiwanese firms as a source of investment and critical technologies such as computer chips, the export of which to China Washington has tried to curtail. At the same time, corporate Taiwan is cooling on its giant neighbour. Geopolitics is not the only reason.
When China opened up to foreign investment in the 1980s, entrepreneurs from Taiwan were the first foreigners to open their wallets. Enticed by cheap labour and land across the strait, they quickly set up shop in the coastal provinces closest to Taiwan. To this day Jiangsu (which includes Kunshan), Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong attract most Taiwanese money (see map on next page). A common language and shared culture helped reduce transaction costs. Foxconn built its first Chinese factory in Shenzhen in 1988. By 2008 around a sixth of China's stock of inward investment came from Taiwan, making it the biggest foreign investor in China.
Today three of China's 12 most popular consumer-goods brands by revenue are Taiwanese. Chinese gobble up Master Kong instant noodles, Want Want rice crackers and Uni-President juices. Apple's three biggest China-based suppliers-Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron-are all Taiwanese.
Now China is going out of its way to recruit more businesses from Taiwan. Between 2018 and 2019 the government unveiled no fewer than 25 policies aimed at luring them. Measures include tax credits and, more striking, a special right to bid on lucrative government contracts, from railway construction to ""Made in China 2025"", an innovation scheme centred on advanced manufacturing. In May the Chinese authorities released an official directive, signed by five ministries, permitting Taiwanese-owned firms in China to ""receive the same treatment as mainland enterprises"". It applies even to sensitive areas like 5G mobile networks, artificial intelligence and the hyperconnected ""Internet of Things"". No other foreign firms enjoy similar treatment.
These efforts by Beijing have so far had limited success. Annual investment flows from Taiwan have fallen by more than half since 2015 (see chart). This growing reticence on the part of corporate Taiwan can be explained by three considerations. The first is geopolitical.
China's goal of discouraging formal independence by strengthening business ties is increasingly transparent to many Taiwanese. Beijing's special treatment of Taiwanese firms, which are designated as domestic ones in its drive for ""indigenous innovation"", only stokes more suspicions. It may have helped Taiwan's independence-leaning president win re-election in January. Chinese firms, which have been able to invest in Taiwan since 2009, are coming under fire from the island's regulators, which suspect them of being a fifth column for the Chinese Communist Party. Last month Taobao Taiwan, the local version of Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce platform, said that it would cease operations.
Trading partners
Geopolitical tussles beyond the Taiwan strait also play a role. Tariffs imposed by America on a long list of Chinese exports have prompted many Taiwanese producers to shift operations out of China. A recent survey by the National Federation of Industries, a trade body in Taiwan, found that four in ten Taiwanese bosses with factories in China said they already have or will ""transfer capacity"" elsewhere, mainly to South-East Asia. Taiwan's Giant, the world's biggest producer of bicycles, has identified Hungary as an alternative production base.
Making life even more difficult for some Taiwanese firms is America's blacklisting of certain Chinese tech titans. Huawei, a Chinese telecoms champion that is a particular target of American ire, last year accounted for 15% of the revenues of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (tsmc), a huge chipmaker. This month tsmc confirmed it has set aside $3.5bn for a new plant in Arizona.
A second challenge for Taiwanese firms concerns competition. Zhang Yingde, a Taiwanese small-business owner in Shanghai, talks of a ""red supply chain"" which, Beijing's directives notwithstanding, continues to favour Chinese bidders. Mr Zhang says he can only hope to get in on the action as a subcontractor. Jerry Huang, the head of Ningbo's Taiwan Business Association, which represents some 300 Taiwanese manufacturers in the eastern Chinese city, says that none has won a big government contract to date.
Mr Huang does not blame discrimination against Taiwanese firms. He points instead to the capabilities of homegrown Chinese rivals, which are becoming more competitive and innovative. This month Wistron, a Taiwanese assembler for Apple, agreed to sell its factory in Kunshan to Luxshare, a low-cost Chinese competitor. The fact that Wistron was prepared to cede operations to a Chinese rival suggests that technical know-how in electronics assembly is no longer a barrier to entry that Taiwanese outfits feel compelled to guard.
Now that their dominance in manufacturing is fading, Taiwanese firms which want to succeed in China may need to ride on ""Taiwan's soft power"", says Keng Shu of Zhejiang University. This will be easier in services, he reckons, given Taiwan's global reputation for warm customer service. But unlike manufacturing, where Taiwan enjoyed a first-mover advantage, China's services industry has no shortage of established players, foreign and domestic.
The third reason for Taiwan Inc's diminished zeal for China has to do with generational change. Uni-Royal in Kunshan is a case in point. Taiwanese expatriates who dominate its management are nearing retirement. Young Taiwanese are reluctant to take on the often thankless task of running Chinese factories. A common refrain heard from Taiwanese owners across China is that the impending ""leadership vacuum"" has made them cautious about big outlays.
To attract stripling Taiwanese entrepreneurs, China's central government has in the past year opened dozens of ""cross-strait entrepreneurship incubators"" in big cities. These offer perks like free office space, introductions to potential Chinese clients, posh flats at discount rents and a chance to apply for up to 500,000 yuan in seed capital from the government. Weak pitches such as insufficiently differentiated mobile apps need not apply, says Zhu Yan, who operates an incubator in Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province. Still, the bar is lower than Chinese venture-capital firms typically set.
Mr Zhu's incubator has lured ten Taiwanese startups. But schemes like it will not be enough to allay Taiwanese bosses' concerns about pricier labour and stiffer competition-let alone about the new great-power rivalry. More likely than not, the golden era of Taiwanese business in China is over. *"

BERLIN
Many guest workers become guest entrepreneurs
TO THE CONSTERNATION of Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, much of the couple's coverage in the German press focused on their Turkish roots. ""Our world can be saved. From Mainz. By children of migrants,"" was a headline in Bild, Germany's best-selling tabloid. Their story certainly defies the cliché of owners of doner-kebab stands and fruit-and-vegetable shops- even if Mr Sahin and Ms Türeci, chief executive and chief medical officer, respectively, of BioNTech, would have preferred to read about the details of their firm's discovery, in partnership with Pfizer, an American drugmaker, of a highly effective vaccine against covid-19.
""There are other BioNTechs,"" says Rosemarie Kay of the ifM, a think-tank in Bonn. Migrants are much likelier than the average German to start a business (see chart on next page). According to a recent survey by Kfw, a state-owned development bank, one in four of the 605,000 founders of firms last year had foreign origins. They are not limited to groceries and gastronomy. Spot ted, established by Nik Myftari, a refugee from Kosovo, is a dating website. Novum, created in 1988 by Nader Etmenan, who fled Iran, has become one of Germany's biggest chains of hotels.
Immigrants to Germany (like Mr Sahin) or those with at least one parent who was born abroad (like Ms Türeci) number 19.6m, representing 24% of the population. A study from the Bertelsmann Foundation, another think-tank, found that members of this group own 773,000 businesses. Of these, 469,000 are sole traders. The rest are employers, mostly in construction, retail and services. Their numbers are growing. By comparison, the number of other Germans who own businesses declined by 275,000 in the period, to 3.2m.
""Germans are averse to self-employment,"" says Armando Garcia-Schmidt of the Bertelsmann Foundation. Many graduates prefer a safe civil-service career to the vicissitudes of starting a business. The booming labour market of the past decade helped skilled and unskilled youngsters land a decent job without trying.
Options for migrants tend to be more limited. Some come from countries with strong entrepreneurial traditions and tend to pick successful entrepreneurs as role models. Various studies show that explicit or implicit discrimination makes the labour market, even in good times, much tougher for migrants. And many have qualifications from their country of origin that are not recognised in Germany, so creating a business is their only chance to earn more than the wage from a menial job.
Mr Garcia-Schmidt expects the labour market to become more difficult for everyone once the pandemic has abated and Germany's generous furlough schemes expire. Covid-19 has made 2020 a terrible year for founders of all stripes. As the country emerges from the coronavirus recession, more native Germans may opt for self-employment as an alternative to joblessness. They can learn a thing or two from their migrant neighbours. *"

NEW YORK
The pandemic is producing clear winners and losers among America's retailers
How have America's retailers coped with covid-19? ""We're still learning,"" declared John Furner, who runs Walmart's vast American operations, on November 17th, as the supermarket giant reported third-quarter results. He is being too modest. Walmart, as well as a handful of other big firms such as Target, its smaller rival, and Home Depot, a diy Goliath benefiting from housebound home-improvers staring at dingy walls and outdated kitchens, are thriving.
Paul Lejuez of Citigroup, a bank, described the three months to October as ""another stellar quarter"" for Walmart. Total global revenues increased by 5.2%, year on year, to $i35bn. If anything, international sales, which grew by just 1.3%, dragged down strong performance in America, which accounts for the bulk of revenues; Walmart has said it will sell most of its flagging Japanese supermarkets. By contrast, domestic comparable-store sales, a standard industry metric, rose by 6.4%. Home Depot's quarterly revenues shot up by 23% compared with a year ago, to $33.5bn, keeping up the previous quarter's pace. Target's operating profit nearly doubled to $i.9bn.
Shining retail stars mask darkness elsewhere in the industry. American shoppers rebounded faster than elsewhere in the rich world (see chart). But retail sales grew by just 0.3% last month, compared with the one before, the slowest in half a year. They softened in most of the 13 categories tracked. As investors swooned over Walmart and Home Depot, Kohl's, a middling retail chain, reported falling revenues. ""The distinction between the haves and the have-nots has gotten even sharper,"" says Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.
Mr Gutman points to the successful firms' superior management of diverse, global supply chains. This allows shoppers to satisfy most of their retail needs in one store-particularly important in a pandemic, when people are keen to limit their outings. Walmart's customers make fewer trips to the store but spend more whenever they do, he notes.
The star retailers' biggest edge, though, comes from e-commerce. Walmart in particular upped its e-game just in time to benefit from a pandemic surge in online shopping. A survey of American shoppers by McKinsey, a consultancy, found that kerbside pick-up has nearly doubled from pre-covid levels, and in-store ""click and collect"" sales have shot up by nearly 50% from last year. Walmart's digital sales leapt by nearly 80% in the latest quarter, year on year, to $10bn. That is still less than 8% of revenues-but more than in the whole of 2016, according to Morgan Stanley. The fast-approaching holiday shopping season is likely to bring even more online sales than usual, says Mr Gutman.
By doubling down on digital, Walmart is taking on Amazon's e-emporium. The tech giant is not taking this lying down. On November 17th it launched its long-awaited digital pharmacy. This threatens not just chemists such as Walgreens and cvs but also Walmart, which sells prescription drugs in over 4,000 of its big-box stores. When it comes to e-commerce, Mr Furner's humility is fully justified. *"

DoorDash is a dish served piping hot. Will it cool?
The new ""TikTok Treats"" menu on Postmates in Los Angeles wins no plaudits for gastronomy. It appeals to carb-loving teens: cloud bread and pancake cereal. But the tie-up with the popular short-video app is another sign that food-delivery firms are coming of age. Among teens and millennials, ordering food online is as ingrained a habit as booking an Airbnb, bingeing on Netflix or hailing an Uber.
Just how hooked consumers are thanks to the pandemic is clear from financial documents filed on November 13th by DoorDash, America's biggest food-delivery company, ahead of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange next month. From January to September it booked orders worth $16bn, up by 198% year on year, earning revenues of $1.9bn. It ferries grub from 390,000 American restaurants.
The majority of America's 700,000 or so eateries now distribute via a delivery app, notes Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse, a bank. The pandemic turbocharged a preexisting trend for convenience food, as more women work and everybody is short of time. In doing so, it has also rehabilitated one of Silicon Valley's most derided business models.
Restaurants entered the digital realm two decades ago when Takeaway.com in Europe and Grubhub in America put menus online. Restaurants delivered the food themselves and the middlemen were reliably profitable. By contrast, the new ""third-party logistics"" firms like DoorDash and Uber Eats (whose ride-hailing parent has also bought Postmates) have to divvy up the bills, which average around $30, three ways. Once drivers and restaurants take their cut not much is left.
Until recently none of these newfangled firms made money, even in emerging markets where labour costs are far lower. Lack of obvious economies of scale or barriers to entry meant several rivals were fighting over market share by offering diners generous discounts-and bleeding red ink in the process. They also faced the prospect of a sharp rise in labour costs. Last year California passed a law that required DoorDash, Uber and other ""gig-economy"" companies to treat app-based workers as full employees.
On November 3rd Californians voted in favour of a ballot initiative which in effect overturns the law-and may discourage other state legislatures from passing simi lar ones. The law's defeat on the tails of the pandemic bonanza has once again whetted investors' appetite for food delivery. DoorDash is hoping for a valuation of $25bn, up from $16bn in its most recent private-market funding round in June. The offering is already oversubscribed. It is hard to argue with growth rates of 100-200% a year, notes Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a research firm. DoorDash bulls point to MeituanDianping, the biggest such app in China, which turned profitable last year and is now worth a cool $230bn.
The American firm's numbers contained plenty to chew on. DoorDash is generating cash and is profitable on an adjusted basis. Its in-app ads business offers juicy margins. The company sees itself as the digital hub for the convenience economy, connecting merchants, customers and riders; the word ""platform"" cropped up 646 times in the filing. It has started delivering groceries and convenience-store items. Its logistics arm sells last-mile delivery to other companies, notably Walmart. Looking ahead, high unemployment amid a continuing pandemic downturn should mean lots of cheap labour.
Other facts are harder to swallow-not least that it has taken covid-19 to make food delivery profitable, and then only marginally so. DoorDash warns that growth will slow as the virus ebbs. The share prices of many listed digital firms that benefited from lockdowns and self-isolating consumers, from Amazon to Zoom, dipped on the news of an effective vaccine. And despite their critics' defeat in California, gig firms will continue to face accusations of thriving on the back of exploited workers. In this respect, DoorDash has already joined the club of listed tech platforms. *"

SAN FRANCISCO
Airbnb's stockmarket debut will be a hit. Never mind its murky prospects
Talk about terrible timing. When the pandemic hit in March, Brian Chesky had just put the finishing touches on the paperwork for Airbnb's much-awaited public listing. Instead of travelling to New York to ring the opening bell at the Nasdaq stock exchange, he found himself spending days (and nights) on Zoom in his home office in San Francisco, fighting to keep his online holiday-rental marketplace alive. ""It was like you are going 100 miles an hour and suddenly have to hit the brakes, Airbnb's boss recalls.
This time around Mr Chesky might be luckier. On November 16th Airbnb unveiled its prospectus, putting it on track for an initial public offering (ipo) next month, just as the first doses of the covid-19 vaccine may become available. The ipo could value Airbnb at more than $3obn. The firm's longer-term prospects are harder to devine.
The vaccine is not the only thing that makes this an opportune time for Airbnb to go public. The window for tech ipos has not been open this wide since the dotcom bubble 20 years ago. More than 50 tech startups have floated this year, raising a total of $26bn, according to Dealogic, a data provider. Many of Airbnb's employees want to cash in on the shares they have been awarded before their right to do so expires. And the firm needs money, on top of the $2bn it raised earlier this year to tide it over-hence its decision to scrap earlier plans to list shares directly without drumming up fresh capital.
Mr Chesky has a good recovery story to tell, too. In the painful second quarter the number of nights booked on Airbnb fell to 28m, from 84m a year before. Gross bookings collapsed by two-thirds, to $3.2bn. In the next three months, though, the numbers rebounded, to 62m and $8bn, mainly thanks to what Mr Chesky calls ""travel redistribution. Guests eschewed virus-hit foreign cities, formerly Airbnb's stronghold, for domestic and rural destinations. Stays less than 500 miles (800km) from home rose by more than 50% this summer.
Mr Chesky has also made Airbnb leaner. Before the pandemic the firm had sunk money into new businesses, including flights and a television studio, to pad revenues ahead of the listing. Since then his motto has been ""back to the roots. He has fired around 1,800 employees, a quarter of the workforce, shut down most of the new activities and radically cut online advertising (more than 90% of guests now book directly on Airbnb's site). As a result, though the firm lost $9i6m in the first six months of the year, it turned a net profit of $2i9m in the third quarter.
Can Airbnb keep this up? Even before the pandemic growth had begun to slow. Once things are back to normal, room for further expansion may be limited, at least in the company's core market. Bernstein, a research firm, expects annual growth in private rentals to slow to 7-8%, from around 20% in the past few years. And Airbnb's operating margins lag behind those of its closest rivals, Booking.com and Expedia (which operates vrbo, a site that lists mostly holiday homes).
Airbnb's future also depends on its ability to police its service and meet a growing list of legal requirements across many jurisdictions where it operates. As with other big online firms, renters have found ways to abuse the platform, for instance by using rental properties for parties; in July police in New Jersey broke up a rowdy event with 700 people. As for regulations, the firm says in its prospectus that by October 2019, 70% of its top 200 cities by revenue had imposed restrictions, such as limits on how many days a year residential properties can be rented out.
Mr Chesky's biggest task, however, will be to work out what Airbnb, now entering its teens, should be when it grows up. He has said he would like to see it evolve like Apple or Disney-firms that have adapted over time and outlived their founders. The pandemic has been a setback for its new lines of business. ""Either we keep doing new things as the world changes, he says, ""or we stop doing new things-and we won't exist in the future. Even if, occasionally, doing new things means sticking to the old ones. *"

Reach a certain prominence in public life and you may be invited to become a non-executive director. The most lucrative option is to join the board of a large company. But for social prestige, there is nothing quite like joining the board of a cultural organisation. In Britain, these boards are dominated by ""the great and the good""-aristocrats and wealthy businesspeople.
Sir John Tusa, a former bbc executive, has written a guide based on his extensive experience among Britain's literati and glitterati. ""On Board: The Insider's Guide to Surviving Life in the Boardroom"" is a useful primer for any board member. The job, Sir John argues, is not all about free tickets and lavish dinners. ""There is no difference between governance on a corporate board and an arts board,"" he says. ""Sitting on a board, let alone chairing one, is one of the most demanding, complex and taxing activities in the world of public life.""
The book also gives an inside glimpse of the political battles that were fought over the future of venerable institutions such as the British Museum, English National Opera and the National Portrait Gallery. Cultural boards face a constant tension between the need to get funding from the government and the artistic ambitions of their executives, a dilemma made even thornier by the need to repair crumbling or outdated buildings.
Such was the traditional nature of these institutions in the years when Sir John operated that the book is sometimes redolent of the interwar era. He was invited to join the board of the British Museum over lunch at the Garrick, a gentleman's club founded in 1831. He then discovered that board meetings were held on Saturday mornings because a former Archbishop of Canterbury, when a trustee, had requested the time slot as it allowed him time to write his Sunday sermon in the afternoon.
Perhaps this old-fashioned atmosphere (which has now been changed by bringing in a wider range of trustees) led to some of the difficulties that Sir John describes. Too many appointments were rushed, he says, forgetting the first rule: ""If you can't see the right candidate in front of you, don't appoint."" One frequent problem he faced was tension between the chairman and chief executive, so he suggested that oneto-one discussions between the two should be part of the appointment process to ensure compatibility. When in their posts, the duo should aim to talk every day.
Even then, the chairman (or woman) must retain a certain air of detachment. The boss's approach, says the author, can be summed up by the quote: ""We are totally on the same side until the day that I have to sack him."" Bad chairmen tend to impose their views, fail to respond to ideas and refuse to alter their approach. Often they place their favourites on the board, creating factions and causing destruction.
Sir John's advice to chief executives is to tell the board what they are doing, when, how and why-all in order to persuade board members that the boss deserves support. But ceos should not deluge trustees or directors with paperwork: ""If information is power, it must be remembered that too much information is a smokescreen.""
As for board members, Sir John says they should ask questions of the executive, and be careful about accepting the answers too easily. They should also remember that there is no such thing as a stupid question. And it is not their job to develop strategy: ""The executive proposes, but the board disposes,"" he says.
Trustees should be chosen with a view that one of them is capable of chairing the board in due course. Furthermore, trustees should know why they have been invited to join the board and how they might best contribute to the organisation's success.
All Sir John's suggestions seem sensible and most would apply to public companies as well as to arts institutions. The role of non-executive directors has never been well defined. Tiny Rowland, a swashbuckling tycoon, dismissed them as ""Christmas tree decorations""-just for show, in other words. Think of the great names that studded the board of Theranos, a blood-test startup, and how they failed to stop its collapse.
Most non-executives do their best but are caught between two stools. They do not know enough to challenge the executives properly. But if they push their questions too far, they will not be reappointed. Above all, trustees and nonexecutive directors cannot do their job unless the management wants their input. Wise bosses should know their limitations and rely on boards for advice."

John stankey is an American chief executive from central casting. The 58-year-old has a square jaw, a lanky frame and, as one friend put it, ""the world's deepest voice. During his 35 years as a telecoms executive, he has been a voracious dealmaker. He helped set Southwestern Bell Corp, one of the Baby Bells spawned by the break-up in 1984 of American Telephone & Telegraph (at&t), on an m&a blitzkrieg that eventually consumed the original Ma Bell herself. He then helped orchestrate its $i76bn push into entertainment, buying DirecTV, America's largest cable provider, in 2015, and Time Warner, a media colossus, three years later. In July he took over as AT&T's boss. A self-confessed ""Bell-head, he doesn't flinch when confronting media moguls. Yet before one constituency he practically cowers: widows, orphans and other investors that depend on at&t as the world's second-biggest dividend-payer after Microsoft.
That is a problem not because at&t cannot afford this year's anticipated $i5bn payout. Despite the travails of covid-19, it easily can. The rub is that it has become a treadmill. This year is the 36th since at&t was broken up in which it has increased the dividend. Such a legacy may not be strange for a stolid telecoms firm. But with a flighty media business on the side, it is a foolish promise. Moreover, AT&T's acquisition spree has saddled it with almost $i5obn of net debt, even as its two core businesses, mobile telecoms and entertainment, are in the throes of upheaval that requires immense financial flexibility. Instead of revitalising each of them, at&t has so far done what many ""dividend aristocrats do- try to sell the family silver to make ends meet.
Yet there are indications that Mr Stankey may be prepared to challenge the old ways of thinking. He ought to-even for the sake of those widows and orphans.
He started the job with the odds stacked against him. Not only has the covid-19 pandemic clobbered WarnerMedia, the renamed Time Warner, by disrupting film releases, accelerating the decline of cable tv and reducing advertising spending. He also had to overcome doubts about his leadership abilities first aired last year by Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, when it took a stake in at&t. When his former boss, Randall Stephenson, announced his retirement in the midst of the pandemic, it was hard to imagine that an outsider could run a company with a market value of $20obn and a phone book's worth of problems by Zoom. So Mr Stankey won the contest, despite his role as Mr Stephenson's lieutenant during years of value destruction. Since then, he has soothed some nerves, taking further acquisitions off the table, promising to repair the balance-sheet and lengthening debt maturities. Yet the share price languishes, as investors wonder if he can sustain the dividend while competing against two fierce rivals, Т-Mobile in telecoms and Disney in entertainment.
One big test of his mettle will be an auction next month of wireless spectrum. Mobile, after all, is AT&T's mainstay, generating as much core earnings, or ebitda, in a week in the third quarter as WarnerMedia did in a month. Yet Т-Mobile, once a distant third in wireless subscriptions, is now running neck-and-neck with at&t and has its sights on Verizon, the leader. After its merger with Sprint, Т-Mobile has also surged ahead of both rivals in the coverage and speed of its fifth-generation (5G) network, adding to its appeal. In order to catch up, at&t and Verizon will take part in an auction of mid-band 5G spectrum starting on December 8th. Verizon's balance-sheet is robust enough to bid what some expect to be at least $15bn. at&t may feel more constrained. Yet those who keep a careful eye on its credit rating think it should splurge, both on spectrum and the fibre networks it lays across America. Davis Hebert of CreditSights, a research firm, calls them the ""core tenets of its business. (How quickly it can sell long-in-the-tooth assets like DirecTV to ease the financial strain is another matter.)
On November 18th Mr Stankey may have shown promising signs of audacity, though, when WarnerMedia announced an unexpected move in support of hbo Max, AT&T's streaming platform that competes with Disney+, not to mention Netflix. It said it would release ""Wonder Woman 1984, a potential Christmas blockbuster, simultaneously on hbo Max and in American cinemas on December 25th (it will hit cinemas in other countries earlier). That will break a long tradition of releasing films in theatres first to recoup production costs at the box-office, and to support the cinema business. It shows the company may be prepared to cannibalise revenues in one part of the firm-Warner Bros, the film studio-for the greater goal of driving subscribers to its streaming service, which is potentially a bigger long-term source of value. If going all-in on streaming attracts hordes of subscribers, it could reward Mr Stankey's dogged faith in the marriage of phone and film.
From Wonder Woman to Superman
It is time for more of such hard choices. Yet the risk is that Mr Stankey feels he has time on his side. He now appears to enjoy Elliott's support (reports that the asset manager had sold its equity stake do not mean it has thrown in the towel; it may still have a large derivatives position). The rating agencies are patient. Neil Begley of Moody's says that because of coronavirus and other reasons, it has put big investment-grade firms like at&t on a ""longer leash. Many remain convinced the dividend is a sacred cow.
That breeds complacency, however. The payout saps AT&T's financial flexibility just when it needs all the leeway it can find. It encourages defensiveness, when Т-Mobile and Disney are, as Roger Entner, a telecoms analyst, puts it, ""surrounding it like wolves. Come what may, one day it will have to cut the dividend-preferably to be complemented with more flexible share buy-backs. If Mr Stankey does that to make the company more nimble, he might emerge a corporate superhero. If it is forced upon him by weak earnings, it will be kryptonite that could cost him his job. *"

HONG KONG
How can governments recover faster from insolvency?
The procedures for resolving an international debt crisis, wrote Alexis Rieffel, a former American Treasury official, in 1985, ""resemble a three-ring circus . In the first ring, the bankrupt country negotiates with the imf, which must decide how much the country can repay and what belt-tightening it must endure. In the second ring, the country asks for leniency from other governments to whom it owes money. And in the third, it seeks a ""comparable deal from private lenders.
The circus sometimes, however, struggles to hold it all together. After Argentina defaulted in May, for example, the imf failed to play its customary role in the first ring. It could not provide new supervision and finance, because the country was still reeling from the failure of its previous imf bail-out. The second ring has also suffered from some absent performers. In the past decade China has become a far bigger lender to poor countries than other governments combined (see chart 1). But it is not a member of the Paris Club, which has tended to oversee debt renegotiations between countries and their official creditors. As for the third ring, when the Latin American debt crisis struck in the early 1980s, it took commercial lenders (and their governments) almost seven years to find a lasting solution. The juggling went on and on.
Many fear another series of defaults is looming. Government revenues and export receipts have plunged in many poor countries (though efforts by America's Federal Reserve to calm financial panic have lowered their cost of borrowing). On November 13th Zambia became the sixth country this year to default on its bonds. Eight spend over 30% of their fiscal revenues on interest payments, reckons Fitch, a rating agency, more than in the early 2000s when Bono and other debt-relief campaigners were at their clamorous best. Fitch gives 38 sovereigns a rating of b+ or worse, where в denotes a ""material risk of default (see chart 2 on next page). According to its projections, governments with a junk rating-BB+ or worse-may soon outnumber those classed as investment-grade.
Will the circus handle any new crisis better than it did in the 1980s? In some ways its task is even harder now. Poor countries owe a wider variety of liabilities to a broader range of creditors. For many emerging economies, bonds have eclipsed bank loans. And loans themselves are far from uniform. Some are secured against state assets, such as a stake in a public enterprise, or oil revenues; the creditor might prefer to seize the collateral rather than write off the debt. Others are syndicated, or parcelled out among many banks, which means that no single creditor can forgive the loan at its own discretion.
This gnarly mix of instruments is matched by an equally tangled bunch of creditors: public, private and everything in between. In April, for example, the G20 ? group of big economies called on member governments to provide a repayment holiday on loans to the world's poorest countries. China was unhappy that private creditors did not share in the effort. Others complained that China Development Bank, which is owned and directed by the state but not synonymous with China's government, did not take part.
There has, however, also been progress. On November 21st-22nd, do leaders will sign off on a ""common framework"" for renegotiating debts with the world's poorest countries. The framework, in effect, extends the principles of the Paris Club to those G20 members who are not already in it, widening the second ring of the circus. It applies only to countries with unsustainable debts, and any borrower that receives relief from the G20 must seek a similar deal from other creditors. Because all lenders must do their bit, little hangs on whether they are classified as official or private. That is perhaps why the framework has met little opposition from China.
There has been progress in contracts as well as clubs. After Argentina defaulted in 2001, it offered to exchange its unpayable bonds for new securities with easier terms. Some bondholders rejected the deal, seeking full payment in New York's courts instead. That made life harder for both Argentina and its other creditors. Since 2003, most bonds issued under New York law have contained ""collective-action clauses"", which compel all bondholders to go along with any deal accepted by the majority. Such clauses helped Ecuador resolve its default this year with ""hardly any real grumbling"", notes Clay Lowery of the Institute of International Finance, a bankers' association. They also helped Argentina reach a deal with its main bondholders in August (albeit with ""a fair amount of grumbling"").
A review of the ""architecture"" for resolving sovereign debt, published by the imf in September, pondered other contractual innovations that might ease future restructurings. Lenders might insist on wider use of ""negative-pledge clauses"" that prevent a borrower pawning vital assets as collateral to other creditors. Syndicated loans might add ""yank the bank"" provisions that allow a lender to be kicked out of the syndicate if it blocks a deal. The fund is also paying renewed attention to ""contingent"" debt instruments that are more sensitive to the ups and downs that befall poor countries. Barbados, for example, has issued bonds that repay less in the event of an earthquake or tropical cyclone.
One idea, proposed by Ben Heller and Pijus Virketis of нвк Capital Management, an investment fund, is ""bendy bonds"". In most cases, these would behave like ordinary bonds. But in a crisis the issuer could extend the maturity and defer interest for a couple of years in return for paying additional interest at the end of the bond's life. The issuer could benefit from the kind of payment holiday envisaged in the G2o's April initiative without any help from the great powers. As the long history of debt restructurings attests, ""fixed"" income liabilities are often anything but. Solemn commitments to pay in full and on time cannot always be kept. Lenders and borrowers alike might therefore welcome instruments that specify up front when and how fixed income will become more flexible."

The winners from Asia's new trade pact
It took eight years of gruelling negotiations to agree on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (rcep), which was signed by 15 countries in Asia and the Pacific on November 15th. The world's newest and biggest regional trade deal is not the deepest. It eliminates fewer tariffs than normal, and some only after two decades. Its coverage of services is patchy, as is that of agricultural goods. India is not a member. Still, when leaders met virtually to sign on the dotted line, they hailed the pact as a triumph.
rcep began as a tidying-up exercise, joining together in one overarching compact the various trade agreements in place between the Association of South-East Asian Nations (asean) and Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. That limits how much trade will be newly affected. Of the $2.3trn in goods flowing between signatories in 2019, 83% passed between those that already had a trade deal.
Some trade will be newly affected, though. China had no existing deal with Japan, for instance; nor did South Korea. So RCEP's economic impact will be more than a rounding error. Peter Petri of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank in Washington, and Michael Plummer of Johns Hopkins University estimate that Japan and South Korea will gain the most. By 2030 their real incomes are expected to be 1% higher than they would have otherwise been.
Perhaps the biggest benefits will come from RCEP's rules of origin, which set out how much regional content a product must have for it to enjoy lower tariffs. asean has trade deals in place with China, South Korea and Japan, but a coffee cup exported by a member may face three different sets of rules depending on the destination. rcep helps by offering companies one set of rules (and paperwork). Rules on content are relatively liberal: many products will need just 40% of their value to be added within the region in order to take advantage of lower tariffs.
The fastest way to annoy Asian diplomats would be to claim that the pact is ""China-led-in fact, asean started the talks. Still, the deal serves China's interests. It had once warily watched its neighbours sign up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which reined in state-owned firms and included rules on labour and environmental standards. Now rcep could strengthen China-centric supply chains- with none of those constraints.
Members may hope that rcep ensures the resilience of supply chains by supporting new, competitive production bases that can withstand the sudden imposition of trade restrictions. The region's vulnerability to such actions became clear this year, when many in the G2o group of countries applied restrictions during the pandemic. These tended to hurt asean members most often, according to analysis by Global Trade Alert, a monitoring group.
Curmudgeons complain that rcep will promote regional trade and supply chains at the expense of those that involve nonmembers, however. Stronger rules covering competition, state-owned firms or product standards might have allayed those fears. But it seems that agreeing on those was too difficult, partly because rcep's members are at vastly different levels of economic development.
For any of these predictions to come true, signatories must first ratify the agreement. Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre, an advisory firm, reckons that could happen by January 2022. Some hope India will join after that, but the chances seem slim. (It withdrew from negotiations because of worries its industry would be swamped by imports from China.) Others hope rcep will revive American interest in the region. Domestic politics will make bold trade initiatives hard for a Biden administration. But it will be watching."

The sale of bbva's American unit to pnc may set off a wave of mergers
In may pnc, America's seventh-largest retail bank by assets, sold a stake in BlackRock, an asset manager, for $17bn. Bill Demchak, pnc's boss, said at the time that worries about the economy had prompted it to divest, in order to ""bullet-proof its balance-sheet. On November 16th he broke cover. pnc said it would buy the American arm of bbva, Spain's second-largest bank, for $11.6bn. The deal could set off a scramble for scale on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, bbva in turn said on the same day that it was in merger talks with Sabadell, another Spanish lender.
Scale has become increasingly important for retail banking in America. It is dominated by four giants-JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup-that have amassed branches while lavishing spending on marketing and technology. The investment in digital banking has paid off during the pandemic, as flashy apps have attracted a growing share of deposits. At the same time, the Federal Reserve's low interest rates are squeezing lending margins. That hurts regional banks most: they rely more on interest income from loans than their Wall Street rivals, which also earn fees on trading and investment-banking activities.
pnc's acquisition of bbva usa Bancshares is the largest banking deal in America since bb&t bought SunTrust for $28bn last year. It will create the country's fifthlargest retail bank (see chart). The combined entity will be a coast-to-coast franchise operating in 29 of the country's 30 largest markets: half of bbva's branches are in Texas, and the rest span southern states, where pnc's presence is limited. Still, pnc may seek to expand further. It has excess capital to deploy, in part because regulators have capped dividends and banned share buybacks. And America's field of mid-size banks remains crowded. At least 30 lenders have assets of around $50bn-250bn.
The price tag on bbva's American franchise amounts to about 30 times its projected earnings in 2021, according to analysts at ubs, a bank. That is a lot for a unit that has long underperformed, posting returns on equity of around 6-7% (bbva's Mexican arm, which is comparable in terms of risk-weighted assets, routinely produces returns of 20% or more). But pnc has demonstrated a knack for turning round ailing ventures, notably the American arm of rbc, a Canadian bank, which it snapped up in 2012. Investors seem confident pnc can repeat the trick: the bank's 1 ? share price rose by 3% on the day the deal was announced.
bbva's investors were even more enthusiastic. Its share price jumped by 20% on the day. Britta Schmidt of Autonomous, a research firm, estimates the net value gained at about €8bn ($9.5bn), or 40% of the bank's market capitalisation. The sale will shore up its core-capital ratio by nearly three percentage points, to 14.5%, well above the level demanded by regulators.
A chunk of the bounty may go towards acquisitions closer to home, fuelling a long-awaited wave of consolidation in Europe's overbanked markets. bbva's American exit makes its portfolio disproportionately exposed to emerging markets, giving it a reason to invest at home. It may also help that, since July, the European Central Bank has encouraged banks to recognise an accounting gain, known as negative goodwill, which they generate when they buy a rival at a lower price than the book value of its assets. Such ""badwill"", in turn, can be used to offset restructuring charges. Investors seem to believe that bbva's talks with Sabadell will succeed: Sabadell's share price jumped by 16% on the pnc news, and a further 9% after pnc and bbva said that due diligence had begun.
Transatlantic divestitures, meanwhile, will probably continue. European banks operating in America should either go big or give up, says Adrian Cighi of Credit Suisse, a bank. Analysts expect hsbc, Europe's largest bank by assets, to signal a partial exit when it releases its results in February. Santander and bnp Paribas, the other European banks with a big American presence, say they do not want to sell. The pnc deal, however, may make shareholders think focus is not such a bad idea."

BONN
A tax-fraud scandal draws in Hamburg's financial and political elite
AT THE VERY last minute, the lawyers of Christian S tried to stop his trial, arguing that the 77-year-old former bigwig with M.M. Warburg, one of Germany's oldest private banks, was too frail to attend court in a pandemic. But on the evening of November 16th Germany's constitutional court ruled that the trial could go ahead the next day. With judges, lawyers and the accused wearing contraptions that looked like oversized diving masks, each shielded by a perspex partition, a prosecutor read out the charge sheet. It took so long that the judge ordered a break halfway through.
Mr S, who cannot be fully named due to reporting restrictions in Germany, is one of four Warburg bankers accused of grave tax evasion through so-called ""cum-ex"" transactions in 13 cases between 2006 and 2013 that cost the German taxman more than €325m ($386m). (The other three will be tried separately.) Cum-ex trades are share transactions done at high speed on or just before the day dividend payments are recorded. Before payment, shares come with (cum) dividends, which are reflected in their prices; after, they come without (ex). A flurry of deals may allow two or more investors to reclaim tax on a given dividend, even though it has been paid just once.
The defendant said very little. He was a confidant of Christian Olearius, the patrician co-owner of the Hamburg-based bank who was head of its supervisory board until he resigned last year, because of his alleged involvement. (Mr Olearius denies any wrongdoing.) Last month the effects of the scandal rippled out to the political sphere, seeming to draw in Olaf Scholz, Germany's finance minister and a former mayor of Hamburg. The city's parliament launched an investigation into why Hamburg under Mr Scholz let €4jm of tax payments owed by the bank lapse under a statute of limitations. As mayor in 2016, Mr Scholz twice met Mr Olearius, a donor to, and fund-raiser for, the city's cultural venues; he says such meetings with bankers and businessmen were customary, and that he cannot remember what was discussed. Warburg says the investigation is purely political, as Mr Scholz is the Social Democratic Party's candidate for the chancellorship.
This is the second cum-ex trial. In March the same court found two former British bankers guilty of tax evasion. They received a suspended sentence as they had co-operated with prosecutors. Warburg came up frequently during the trial because of its role in the trades made by the British duo. It was ordered to pay around €176m as part of the March ruling. It says it has not breached any laws and is appealing.
The lawyers for Mr S maintained a similar line. The trial, which is due to conclude in January, seems likely to be more confrontational than the first-and perhaps more embarrassing for Germany's political and financial classes. Many expect Mr Olearius to be indicted soon.
Whatever happens, Warburg's standing may have already suffered. ""It might have gambled away the trust of clients,"" says Christopher Kopper of Bielefeld University. Its future depends on how much it will have to pay out when all the fines are totted up-and whether customers abandon the grand old bank."

WHAT IS IT like to lose to a machine? In 1997 the world's best chess player, Garry Kasparov, was beaten by Deep Blue, a $10m super-computer made by ibm. Twenty years later he wrote ""Deep Thinking"", a book about the experience. What comes across vividly is how exhausting each game was. Chess players, even great ones like Mr Kasparov, get tired and frustrated. Doubts begin to creep in. By contrast, Deep Blue just needed the occasional reboot.
Now turn the tables. What is it like to win against the machines? By New Year's Eve the least smart buy-and-hold investor in an index fund might be able to boast of such a victory. For 2020 has been rotten for ""quant"" funds, which use powerful computers to sift market data for patterns that might predict future prices. ""Long-short"" momentum-buying recent winners and selling recent losers-had been one of quant's better strategies this year. Yet on November 9 th, when news broke of an effective vaccine for covid-19, it had its worst ever day.
Quants rely on history. If something happens that is without precedent, such as a vaccine in a pandemic, they have a problem. No doubt a few quant hedge funds are nursing heavy losses. And perhaps a few discretionary funds have made a killing. The terrain on which human traders can beat the machines is much diminished. But November 9th shows it is still possible. Chalk it up as a small victory for the species.
It is no small irony that momentum trading takes advantage of human weaknesses. One of these is ""conservatism bias"". Investors tend to stick to prior views too rigidly and change them only slowly in response to new information. They may give undue emphasis to the price paid for a stock as a marker of its true value and, as a consequence, sell winning stocks too soon and hang on to dud stocks for too long. There is also a contrasting tendency to extrapolate past success. So as well as under-reacting to news, people also over-react to it. Momentum trading seeks to exploit this.
A lot of long-short strategies, including momentum, rank stocks by a particular attribute and then buy the top decile (or quintile) of the group and sell the bottom one. This requires machines. Sorting through thousands of securities quickly is beyond the meagre talents of a living, breathing portfolio manager. It requires algorithms that first establish and then fine-tune the optimal period over which to do the sorting. And it needs speedy and seamless access to automatic trading platforms and market data. You would not want to do all this by hand and brain.
In chess, the brute force of computing power eventually wins out. In investing, the strength of synthetic traders is in dealing with reams of information that is machine-readable, such as tick-by-tick stock prices. The most powerful machines can make sense even of unstructured (""big"") data. But an event like the discovery of a vaccine can flummox even the smartest of them. Humans retain an edge. They are able to winnow down endless possibilities using mental shortcuts. They can imagine scenarios that the past has not thrown up-scenarios such as ""a vaccine may become available soon, given the amount of money and effort being thrown at it""; and ""news of such a vaccine might spark a sell-off in 'stay-athome' shares and a rally in 'get-out-ofthe-house' shares"".
But why were the moves in prices so dramatic? A good rule of thumb, says one quant guru, is that the faster you trade, the less capacity there is for your strategy. A speedy trading strategy, such as momentum, relies on liquid markets to keep turnover costs in check. The strategy can become crowded. And when the quants suffer losses, they may be forced by risk-management rules to close their positions. As everyone rushes to get out at the same time, it makes for extreme price movements. This is in part why sophisticated quant funds are constantly evolving. They look for unique datasets on which to train their machines. Or they try to come up with new ways to parse weaker signals that others cannot detect in the market noise.
The quants have had a rough time, but they are hardly in retreat. Their domain will only expand. The margin of advantage for discretionary trading-for human ingenuity, in other words-will shrink. It is worth remembering that the first time Mr Kasparov played against Deep Blue, in 1996, he won. Now, as he has pointed out, you can download free chess engines that are far more powerful. We should savour victories over the machines while we can."

WASHINGTON, DC
Why money is changing hands much less frequently
INFORMING A CUSTOMER ""I'm sorry, I can't give you your money is the stuff of bankers' nightmares. But in June the Federal Reserve had to tell commercial banks just that: it was running out of spare change. As parts of the economy shut down, the flow of coins from wallets to deposits gummed up, leading retailers and banks to demand more. The Fed was forced to ration the supplies of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters based on banks' previous orders.
The speed with which money, both physical and digital, moves is an important indicator of economic activity. Money's ""velocity is calculated by dividing a country's quarterly gdp by its money stock that quarter. The Fed tracks velocity for several definitions of money. The measure that is most popular with economists is ""money of zero maturity (mzm), which includes assets redeemable on demand at face value-such as bank deposits and moneymarket funds. The bigger gdp is relative to the money supply, the higher the velocity.
Velocity has plummeted this year (see chart). In the second quarter, the velocity of mzm dipped below one for the first time on record, meaning that the average dollar was exchanged less than once between April and June. The decline stemmed from both economic shutdowns and heightened uncertainty early on in the pandemic, as well as a money supply dramatically increased by stimulus efforts.
Recessions tend to dampen the velocity of money by increasing its attractiveness as a store of value relative to alternatives. Uncertainty pushes up demand for money, explains David Andolfatto of the St Louis Fed. In a weakening economy, consumers prefer to save rather than shop; investors cling to the safe assets that make up mzm.
Both the Depression and the Great Recession began with sharp declines in velocity. Where it recovered its pre-Depression levels by the mid-i930s, though, velocity continued to fall after the 2007-09 crisis. Some economists attribute that to the Dodd-Frank act, which took effect in 2010 and put regulatory pressure on shadowbanking activities, increasing demand to hold money in the formal banking system.
As covid-19 spread earlier in the year, anxiety about the economy sent velocity tumbling further. In April personal savings shot up to a record 33.6% of disposable income, not only because of worries about the future but also because shutdowns limited the ability to spend. October's rate of 14.3% was still higher than in all pre-pandemic months since 1975.
Meanwhile, stimulus measures have pushed up the money supply, in order to prevent the economy, and inflation, falling off a cliff. Households were sent cheques for $1,200, unemployment benefits were made more generous and the Fed bought government debt with new money. The stock of mzm shot up by more than 20% between March and June.
The glut of dollars could create a new set of difficulties once the pandemic ends. Households, flush with cash, could go on a spending spree. As consumer demand recovers, more money will start to change hands and inflation will start to rise. Though shoring up prices is partly why the Fed is buying assets in the first place, some economists worry that the situation could quickly spiral out of its control, if households all try to spend their money at once. Michael Bordo of Rutgers University predicts ""a greater risk of inflation getting out of control than the Fed is willing even to contemplate"". If the velocity of money rebounds post-pandemic, placing a speed limit on it may prove to be as troublesome as jump-starting it."

HONG KONG
Investors are jolted by the default of a highly rated state-owned firm
China's credit-rating agencies do not disguise their love for the state. Yongcheng Coal and Electricity's state pedigree was at the top of a list of merits in a recent credit appraisal by ccxi, one such agency, which expressed its confidence in the group on October 10th with a top-notch aaa rating on a 1bn-yuan ($152m) bond.
Yongcheng's default a month later on a different 1bn-yuan bond has sent a shockwave through China's $14trn bond market. The company paid overdue interest three days later, but not before investors dumped state-backed debt with links to Henan province, the region in central China where it is based. The jarring news that a state group with a recent AAA-rating had defaulted halted at least 20bn-yuan-worth of planned debt issuance over the following week, as yields on state debt surged.
The concern was so great that a large state-owned company in neighbouring Shanxi province was forced to issue a rare statement to investors on November 14th pledging that the companies it controls would not default. ""The particular thing about this case was that it was completely unexpected, said Charles Chang of s&p, another rating agency.
Investor panic has focused on Yongcheng, but there are signs of wider tumult. Huachen Automotive, a carmaker owned by a provincial northern government, said on November 16th that it had sought restructuring after defaulting on a bond in October. Tsinghua Unigroup, a technology firm controlled by Tsinghua University, failed to repay a i.3bn-yuan bond on the same day. The companies had enjoyed aaa and aa ratings, respectively.
That state firms can default is no surprise. Yongcheng is one of ten to have done so this year. Regulators have realised they can no longer afford to bail out inefficient, loss-making companies. A small but steady stream of weak state firms have been allowed to default since 2015, part of a government plan to impose discipline on the market. Defaults also make it possible to price in risk better, something foreign investors have struggled to do. As defaults have risen over the past three years, foreign investors have ploughed record sums into China's bond market.
But Yongcheng's default has alarmed investors because it throws out the old rule-book that helped determine which groups would receive state support and which would be allowed to go bust. Parent companies have been the strongest guiding light to date. Yongcheng's parent, for example, is one of Henan's largest stateowned groups and is wholly owned by the province's asset administrator, making Yongcheng state royalty in the region. Huachen Automotive is owned by a similar entity. Such proximity to powerful asset administrators used to give investors confidence that the state would swoop to the rescue at the first sign of distress. Not any more.
Scale also used to be important. Large state groups have been valuable to cities and provinces because they give secure employment to tens of thousands of people. Huachen Automotive alone has more than 40,000 employees. Restructuring them would threaten jobs and social stability, but these are risks the government appears increasingly willing to take. ""Parent company, size-these are the reasons people argue you should buy, says Edmund Goh of Aberdeen Standard Investments, an asset manager. ""This is starting to change, and people are going to be reading more of the details.
Investors and rating agencies will have to study state firms' fundamentals, instead of relying on perceived government backing. s&p expects more defaults among large state groups that were once considered untouchable. Zhu Ning, a professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, said that regulators may even launch ""a crackdown on the rating agencies for better-informed ratings. The shift will prove awkward for local agencies, such as ccxi, which are under pressure from state groups to hand out as many sparkling aaa ratings as possible."

Investors seeking action on climate change turn to the courts
Kathleen o'donnell is a 23-year-old Australian law student whose holdings of her government's bonds mature in 2050, by which date carbon emissions may well have pushed global warming past the 1.5°C goal enshrined in the un Paris agreement. In July Ms O'Donnell filed a court case against the Australian government for failing to disclose climate-change risks to investors. In 2018 Mark McVeigh, another young Australian, sued his pension fund, the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust (Rest), for allegedly failing to adequately manage the risks that climate change poses to its investments.
The fact that Mr McVeigh and Ms O'Donnell are both Australian may reflect their government's laggardly approach to climate change. But their court cases are also part of a growing willingness among green investors to see legal action as an alternative to divestment. ""Unless the corporate sector switches quickly to meet investor expectations, I think we are inevitably going to see increasing shareholder litigation,"" says Peter Barnett, a lawyer with ClientEarth, an ngo.
The approach can yield results. On November 2nd, with Mr McVeigh's case due back in court that day, Rest, which manages assets worth A$57bn ($42bn), agreed to settle, stating that ""climate change is a material, direct and current financial risk"" to the pension fund and committing itself to identifying and managing the risks. It now aims to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050. (Ms O'Donnell's case is still being heard.)
In some ways, litigation is the logical next step as investors become more engaged. The number of shareholder resolutions seeking to shift companies' policies on climate change is rising, including through initiatives like Climate Action 100+, a group of 518 investors with more than $47trn in assets. ShareAction, a charity, counts 11 shareholder resolutions citing climate change filed in Europe in 2020, up from five in 2015.
If resolutions fail, shareholders can divest, or they can choose to sue. In 2018 a group of 95 asset managers overseeing $11.5trn called on rich-world utilities to draw up decarbonisation plans that are consistent with the Paris goals and eliminate coal power by 2030. ""If necessary, we will deploy all the tools available to us as shareholders to require laggards to do so,"" they wrote in the Financial Times. To Mr Barnett, that implies a willingness to litigate. ap7, a Swedish pension fund, lists initiating ""legal processes"" against companies as one of its tools to promote sustainable asset management.
So far, most lawsuits have centred on fiduciary duty to disclose climate risk. Shareholders have sued the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for failing to disclose them, including risks related to possible investment in a coal mine (the lawsuit was dropped when the bank published an annual report acknowledging the risk). In America ExxonMobil, an oil major, has been beset by class-action and shareholder lawsuits alleging that the company has misled investors on climate risks. So far, none has been successful.
In some more recent cases, the focus has shifted from disclosure to demanding strategies to reduce risk. Mr McVeigh's case alleged that Rest was failing to address the risks posed by climate change. Ms O'Donnell's case is being watched for a different kind of outcome. If she wins, the Australian government, which has done much to support the coal industry and little to limit national emissions, may have to issue a public statement about the financial risks posed by climate change. A backlash against dirty bonds is already hurting some of Australia's regional governments. Last year Sweden's central bank said that it would not invest in the assets of dirty issuers, and promptly sold bonds issued by Queensland and Western Australia.
Occasionally shareholder litigation can lower emissions directly. In 2018 ClientEarth bought €30-worth ($36) of shares in Enea, a Polish power company, and later sued over the firm's plan to build Ostroleka C, dubbed ""the last coal unit ever to be built in Poland"". The ngo argued that the decarbonisation of the energy sector would make Ostroleka C an unprofitable stranded asset, creating an ""indefensible"" financial risk. The Polish courts ruled in ClientEarth's favour last year, and the project has been abandoned-a powerful precedent."

Barack obama's economic record is overshadowed by a torturously slow recovery from the global financial crisis. A premature turn to deficit reduction left America's recovery in the hands of a Federal Reserve that was doctrinally unprepared to engineer a rapid rebound in employment. Mr Obama's vice-president, and now the president-elect, Joe Biden, no doubt took the lessons of that experience to heart. Ahead of America's presidential election on November 3rd, he seemed poised to meet the pandemic-induced downturn with fiscal force. If the Democratic Party does not win a Senate majority, however, an all-too-familiar mess might ensue. With generous fiscal support seemingly off the cards, the central bank may again prove ill-equipped to rise to the challenge of providing needed stimulus. And Mr Biden may struggle to place his stamp on the Fed's board of governors. The drama surrounding the nomination of Judy Shelton, a Republican pick with outlandish economic views, which on November 17th stumbled after it appeared she had insufficient support in the Senate, could become the first of many.
Central banks once required little in the way of fiscal assistance. But they have struggled to cope since a drop in short-term interest rates towards zero sapped their preferred policy tool of its potency. None has dared to cut rates deep into negative territory, fearing the potential risks to banking systems. Massive asset-purchase programmes have provided a modest fillip to demand, and central bankers in Asia and Europe continue to experiment with new tools, by expanding their purchases beyond government bonds and setting caps on long-term interest rates, for instance. Nonetheless, diminished monetary ammunition has led economists to advocate that fiscal policy play a much larger role in stabilising the economy.
The Fed has tried to adjust to this new world. In the wake of the financial crisis it promised to keep interest rates ""at exceptionally low levels...for an extended period. But that failed to spark a rapid recovery. Perhaps the public doubted that the Fed would actually keep rates low, and tolerate the resulting faster price growth, when the time came. The Fed's promise may well have been undermined by its framework, which stipulated an inflation target of 2%. The need for a new approach-one that would explicitly enable the Fed to accept higher inflation, and so keep interest rates low for longer-led Jerome Powell, its chairman, to launch a strategy review in 2019. In August this year he unveiled a revised framework, one of ""average-inflation targeting. Its premise is simple. If the Fed wants to hit its 2% target on average, then periods of below-target inflation, which are expected to be numerous in coming years, must be offset by corresponding periods of above-target inflation. The Fed was giving itself permission not to slam the economic brakes (by raising interest rates) should inflation threaten to rise above 2%.
A promise not to brake, though, cannot get a stalled car moving. The Fed did not pair its new strategy with other demand-boosting measures. It bought roughly $3trn in assets between February and June, as covid-19 sent the economy into a tailspin, but has since kept its balance-sheet roughly flat. The Fed's new doveishness looks to be opportunistic rather than active: it will accept higher inflation should someone else kick the economy in that direction, but is reluctant to try new monetary measures to deliver a kick of its own. That might explain why market expectations of inflation in ten years' time remain well below pre-pandemic levels and have changed little since the summer.
It seems that, like Mr Biden, Mr Powell placed his hopes in fiscal stimulus. The chairman has repeatedly urged Congress to provide more support to America's pandemic-stricken economy. Now, though, Democrats must win two difficult run-off races in January to keep the Senate out of the hands of Republicans, who are unlikely to facilitate Mr Biden's policies. (A Republican Senate would continue to be led by Mitch McConnell, who said in 2010 that limiting Mr Obama to one presidential term was his party's priority.) Mr Biden's grand economic plans thus look doomed, shifting chief responsibility for America's economic fortunes back to the central bank. Passive doveishness alone may not suffice.
Joeknows
The Fed will do its best to respond. It may soon approve more monetary stimulus in response to a new covid-induced economic chill; in a speech on November 16th Richard Clarida, the Fed's vicechairman, hinted that an expanded asset-purchase programme could be in the offing. But the opportunity to pair new measures with an attention-grabbing policy overhaul has passed. A revision to its strategy just months after the last one would undermine the central bank's credibility.
A change in its leadership could give the Fed an opportunity to adjust its message and tactics. But Mr Biden will not find it easy to remould the central bank. Mr Powell's term as chairman does not expire until 2022. His decent record means that Mr Biden is unlikely to depart from the custom of renewing a sitting chairman's term (it is one that President Donald Trump departed from when he did not reappoint Janet Yellen, Mr Powell's predecessor). Nor is it clear that a Republican Senate would approve Mr Biden's nominees, which could soon become a problem if Lael Brainard, a doveish Fed governor who is considered to be one of the front-runners to be Mr Biden's treasury secretary, vacates her seat. In 2011the Republicans blocked Mr Obama's choice of Peter Diamond, a Nobel-prizewinning economist, and politicians' interest in monetary policy has only increased since. As The Economist went to press, Mr McConnell continued to hunt for votes among a quarantine-depleted Republican caucus to approve Ms Shelton's nomination. Mr Biden may find that economic ideas have changed since he last walked the corridors of power. Politics has not."

Fighter aircraft will soon get ai pilots. But they will be wingmen, not squadron leaders
Classic dogfights, in which two pilots match wits and machines to shoot down their opponent with well-aimed gunfire, are a thing of the past. Guided missiles have seen to that, and the last recorded instance of such duelling was 32 years ago, near the end of the Iran-Iraq war, when an Iranian F-4 Phantom took out an Iraqi Su-22 with its 20mm cannon.
But memory lingers, and dogfighting, even of the simulated sort in which the laws of physics are substituted by equations running inside a computer, is reckoned a good test of the aptitude of a pilot in training. And that is also true when the pilot in question is, itself, a computer program. So, when America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (darpa), an adventurous arm of the Pentagon, considered the future of air-to-air combat and the role of artificial intelligence (ai) within that future, it began with basics that Manfred von Richthofen himself might have approved of.
In August eight teams, representing firms ranging from large defence contractors to tiny startups, gathered virtually under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (apl) in Laurel, Maryland, for the three-day final of DARPA's AlphaDogfight trials. Each had developed algorithms to control a virtual F-16 in simulated dogfights. First, these were to be pitted against each other. Then the winner took on a human being.
Dropping the pilot?
""When I got started, says Colonel Dan Javorsek, who leads darpa's work in this area, ""there was quite a bit of scepticism of whether the ai algorithms would be up to the task. In fact, they were. The winner, created by Heron Systems, a small firm in the confusingly named town of California, Maryland, first swept aside its seven digital rivals and then scored a thumping victory against the human, a pilot from America's air force, in five games out of five.
Though dogfighting practice, like parade-ground drill and military bands, is a leftover from an earlier form of warfare that still serves a residual purpose, the next phase of darpa's ace (air combat evolution) project belongs firmly in the future, for it will require the piloting programs to control two planes simultaneously. Also, these virtual aircraft will be armed with short-range missiles rather than guns. That increases the risk of accidental fratricide, for a missile dispatched towards the wrong target will pursue it relentlessly. Tests after that will get more realistic still, with longer-range missiles, the use of chaff and flares, and a requirement to deal with corrupt data and time lags of a sort typical of real radar information.
The point of all this, putative Top Guns should be reassured, is not so much to dispense with pilots as to help them by ""a redistribution of cognitive workload within the cockpit, as Colonel Javorsek puts it. In theory, taking the pilot out of the plane lets it manoeuvre without regard for the impact of high g-forces on squishy humans. An uncrewed plane is also easier to treat as cannon-fodder. Still, most designs for new fighter jets have not done away with cockpits. For example, both of the rival European programmes-the British-led Tem- pest and the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System (FCAS)-are currently ""optionally manned"". There are several reasons for this, explains Nick Colosimo, a lead engineer at bae Systems, Tempest's chief contractor.
One is that eliminating the pilot does not provide much of a saving. The cockpit plus the assorted systems needed to keep a human being alive and happy at high altitude-cabin pressure, for example-contribute only 1-2% of a plane's weight. A second is that even ai systems of great virtuosity have shortcomings. They tend not to be able to convey how they came to a decision, which makes it harder to understand why they made a mistake. They are also narrowly trained for specific applications and thus fail badly when outside the limits of that training or in response to ""spoofing"" by adversaries.
An example of this inflexibility is that, at one point in the AlphaDogfight trials, the organisers threw in a cruise missile to see what would happen. Cruise missiles follow preordained flight paths, so behave more simply than piloted jets. The ai pilots struggled with this because, paradoxically, they had beaten the missile in an earlier round and were now trained for more demanding threats. ""A human pilot would have had no problem,"" observes Chris DeMay, who runs the apl's part of ace. ""ai is only as smart as the training you give it.""
This matters not only in the context of immediate military success. Many people worry about handing too much autonomy to weapons of war-particularly when civilian casualties are possible. International humanitarian law requires that any civilian harm caused by an attack be no more than proportionate to the military advantage hoped for. An ai, which would be hard to imbue with relevant strategic and political knowledge, might not be able to judge for itself whether an attack was permitted.
Of course, a human being could pilot an uncrewed plane remotely, says Mr Colosimo. But he doubts that communications links will ever be sufficiently dependable, given the ""contested and congested electromagnetic environment"". In some cases, losing communications is no big deal; a plane can fly home. In others, it is an unacceptable risk. For instance, fcas aircraft intended for France's air force will carry that country's air-to-surface nuclear missiles.
The priority for now, therefore, is what armed forces call ""manned-unmanned teaming"". In this, a pilot hands off some tasks to a computer while managing others. Today's pilots no longer need to point their radars in the right direction manually, for instance. But they are still forced to accelerate or turn to alter the chances of the success of a shot, says Colonel Javorsek. Those, he says, ""are tasks that are very well suited to hand over"".
One example of such a handover comes from Lockheed Martin, an American aerospace giant. It is developing a missileavoidance system that can tell which aircraft in a formation of several planes is the target of a particular missile attack, and what evasive actions are needed. This is something that currently requires the interpretation by a human being of several different displays of data.
Another example is ground-collision avoidance. In 2018 a team led by the American air force, and including Lockheed Martin, won the Collier Trophy, an award for the greatest achievement in aeronautics in America, for its Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, which takes control of a plane if it is about to plough into the terrain. Such accidents, which can happen if a pilot experiencing severe g-forces passes out, account for three-quarters of the deaths of F-16 pilots. So far, the system has saved the lives of ten such pilots.
A dog in the fight?
Eventually, darpa plans to pit teams of two planes against each other, each team being controlled jointly by a human and an ai. Many air forces hope that, one day, a single human pilot might even orchestrate, though not micromanage, a whole fleet of accompanying unmanned planes.
For this to work, the interaction between human and machine will need to be seamless. Here, as Suzy Broadbent, a human-factors psychologist at bae, observes, the video-game and digital-health industries both have contributions to make. Under her direction, Tempest's engineers are working on ""adaptive autonomy"", in which sensors measure a pilot's sweat, heart-rate, brain activity and eye movement in order to judge whether he or she is getting overwhelmed and needs help. This approach has been tested in light aircraft, and further tests will be conducted next year in Typhoons, fighter jets made by a European consortium that includes bae.
Ms Broadbent's team is also experimenting with novel ways to deliver information to a pilot, from a Twitter-like feed to an anthropomorphic avatar. ""People think the avatar option might be a bit ridiculous,"" says Ms Broadbent, who raises the spectre of Clippy, a famously irritating talking paper clip that harangued users of Microsoft Office in the 1990s and 2000s. ""Actually, think about the information we get from each other's faces. Could a calming voice or smiling face help?""
Getting humans to trust machines is not a formality. Mr Colosimo points to the example of an automated weather-information service introduced on aircraft 25 years ago. ""There was some resistance from the test pilots in terms of whether they could actually trust that information, as opposed to radioing through to air traffic control and speaking to a human."" Surrendering greater control requires breaking down such psychological barriers.
One of the aims of AlphaDogfight, says Mr DeMay, was to do just that by bringing pilots together with ai researchers, and letting them interact. Unsurprisingly, more grizzled stick-jockeys tend to be set in their ways. ""The older pilots who grew up controlling the radar angle...see this sort of technology as a threat,"" says Colonel Javorsek. ""The younger generation, the digital natives that are coming up through the pipeline. trust these autonomous systems."" That is good news for darpa; perhaps less so for Colonel Javorsek. ""These things that I'm doing can be rather hazardous to one's personal career"", the 43-yearold officer observes, ""given that the people who make decisions on what happens to me are not the 25-year-old ones. They tend to be the 50-year-old ones."""

Another new vaccine arrives, and a new class of drugs is born
WAITING FOR a breakthrough in the fight against covid-19 has been a bit like waiting for a bus to arrive. After almost a year of watch-checking and neck-craning, two come along at once. First, on November 9th, Pfizer, an American pharma giant and BioNTech, a German minnow, announced that they had jointly developed an effective vaccine for the illness. They were followed, on November 16th, by Moderna, an American biotech firm.
Moderna says its offering is 94.5% effective. Pfizer says the efficacy of its is 95%. Moderna's figure is an estimate based on a peek at data being gathered in a continuing trial involving 30,000 volunteers. Pfizer's comes from the final analysis of a trial involving 43,000 people, in which 170 cases of covid-19 were seen. Of these, 162 were in the placebo arm (ie, those involved had received dummy injections).
The news bodes well for a third candidate, from AstraZeneca and Oxford University. This pair have, rather notably, not released any interim data from their trials so far. They have also been vaguer about when their vaccine might be available, saying only, ""the end of the year"". But it is thought their trials are only weeks away from having a full set of data. Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's head of r&d, told the Greenwich Economic Forum, a conference held last week, that the firm might apply for full approval-rather than the emergency authorisation sought by the other two projects-in America, and perhaps in Britain and other parts of Europe as well.
More good news was to be found among the details of how, and for whom, these vaccines work. All the severe cases of covid were seen in unvaccinated volunteers. It is also now clear that the vaccines worked in participants of a range of ages, including those over 65, and from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. This means both vaccines will save lives in groups of people who have been hit disproportionately hard by covid-19. Data published this week in the Lancet suggest that the elderly respond well to the AstraZeneca vaccine, too. Continuing reviews of the safety of these vaccines suggest they are well tolerated, although a minority do get a day of flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle and joint pain.
The first two vaccines both look like worthy weapons in the fight against covid-19. There is, though, one thing about the Moderna vaccine that sets it apart. It can be kept in a regular fridge at between 2°C and 8°C for 30 days. The Pfizer vaccine, by contrast, needs to be kept ultracold, at -70°C or below, most of the time. That will make the Moderna vaccine far easier and cheaper to distribute (although the cost of the Moderna vaccine itself is higher). If the AstraZeneca vaccine proves successful, it, too, is thought likely to need only a standard refrigerator to preserve it. And because this vaccine is also a fraction of the price of the others, it might still end up being the most popular choice.
All three vaccines use the same strategy: to introduce into the human body rna (a molecule similar to dna) that carries the recipe for ""spike"", a protein abundant on the outsides of particles of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. The body then uses this recipe to manufacture spike, and the immune system, recognising the protein as alien, mounts a response to it. Thus stimulated, the immune system can react rapidly if it subsequently encounters the spike proteins of actual viruses.
The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna introduce the rna directly, as molecules known as messenger rna (mRNA) held inside small, fatty particles called liposomes. AstraZeneca's offering instead incorporates the rna into the genetic material of a harmless cold virus. The mRNA approach is regarded as particularly interesting, because this is the first successful example of what researchers hope will be a new class of drugs that work by feeding cells instructions to make therapeutic proteins in situ.
Message received
Learning how to introduce mRNA into the body without it either being destroyed or stimulating an unhelpful immune response has been challenging. These two new vaccines are the first evidence of the technology's potential. Moderna is pursuing mRNA as the basis for other vaccines, against such pathogens as cytomegalovirus, influenza, paediatric-respiratorysyncytial virus and Zika. BioNTech, meanwhile, is exploring the use of mRNA to stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. Its pipeline includes treatments for malignant melanoma and for prostate, head-and-neck and breast cancers.
As for covid-19, the success of these rapidly created mRNA vaccines bodes well for dealing with any future mutations of sarscov-2. As the pandemic continues to spread, and such mutations accrue, it is possible that the excellent responses these vaccines now provoke could wane. That, though, should not be a problem. Just as natural selection can tinker with the virus's genetic code, so too can scientists tinker with the code in the vaccines. And, once they have proved themselves, those vaccines could be adjusted every year, as happens already with influenza vaccines. The tools the world needs to emerge from the covid-19 pandemic are starting to arrive. That they are all arriving at the same time is an unlooked-for blessing."

BEIJING
China plans to bring back the first Moon rocks for 40 years
IN JANUARY 2019, when a Chinese spacecraft called Chang'e 4 visited the Moon, the mission broke new ground, figuratively speaking, by landing on the far side of that orb, which is perpetually invisible from Earth and thus also out of direct radio contact. This meant communications had to be relayed by a satellite which had been cunningly located for the purpose at a place where the interaction of the gravitational fields of Earth and Moon meant it could orbit a point in empty space.
China's next lunar mission, by contrast, will break ground literally. Chang'e 5, scheduled for launch around November 24th, is intended to drill two metres down into the Moon's surface, retrieve about 2kg of rock, and then return this to Earth. If successful, it will be the first lunar samplereturn mission since 1976, when a Soviet probe called Luna 24 sent back a mere 170g of the stuff. And it will be another step forward in China's space programme.
The Chang'e missions, named after a Chinese Moon goddess, have had their ups and downs. Chang'e 5 was originally scheduled for blast off in 2017, but the failure in July of that year of an otherwise-unrelated project that was, like Chang'e 5, using a Long March 5 as its launch vehicle, caused a delay. (Chang'e 4 used a different sort of launcher, a Long March 3B.) The ""go"" does, however, now seem to have been given. State media reported on November 17th that the rocket with Chang'e 5 on board has been moved to its launch pad at Wenchang space centre, on Hainan island.
Assuming the launch goes to plan, success will then depend on a complex ballet involving the craft's four components. These are a service module, a return-toEarth module, a lunar lander and an ascender-a configuration originally used by America's Apollo project. Once the mission is in lunar orbit, the lander and the ascender will separate from the orbiting mother ship of service and return modules as a single unit and go down to the surface. The landing site is in the northern part of a vast expanse of basalt called Oceanus Procellarum, a previously unvisited area. Researchers hope rocks collected here will confirm that volcanic activity on the Moon continued until far more recently than the 3.5bn years ago that is the estimate derived from studies of currently available samples.
Once the new material has been gathered, which will take several days, the ascender will lift off, dock with the mother ship and transfer its haul to the return module. The service module will then carry the return module back to Earth, releasing it just before arrival to make a landing at a recovery site in Inner Mongolia, also used for China's crewed missions, in December.
Digging into the lunar surface may, however, pose problems. InSight, an American rover now on the surface of Mars, has struggled to operate a drill nicknamed ""the mole"" that is designed to reach three metres below ground level. According to nasa, America's space agency, this is because the mole has encountered clumpier regolith than its designers were expecting, causing it to bounce rather than burrow.
If Chang'e 5 does manage to overcome such hazards and return samples to Earth, China has said little so far about which foreign countries, if any, will be granted access to them. But America is likely to be last in the queue. For the past couple of decades American governments of all stripes have been reluctant to co-operate with China in space-related matters, largely because of fears about giving away secrets useful for designing ballistic missiles. In space, as in so much else, the two powers are not-sofriendly rivals. China's stated goal is to establish a crewed base near the Moon's south pole, where water is available in the form of ice perpetually shielded from sunlight by crater walls. America has similar plans. Watch, as it were, this space. *"

Sieve-toothed seals may be whales in the making
LAKE BAIKAL, near Russia's border with Mongolia, is, by volume, the biggest body of fresh water on Earth. At 1.6km, it is also the deepest. Several unusual animals call it home, including the world's only species of freshwater seal.
Baikal's seals are abundant. There are about 100,000 of them. But the lake is nutrient-poor, so how they do so well has been a mystery. A study just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, by Watanabe Yuuki of the National Institute of Polar Research, in Tokyo, suggests the answer is by filtering tiny organisms from the water.
Most seals eat fish. And Baikal seals do, indeed, have needle-pointed canines of the sort expected of piscivores. But in 1982 researchers noted that they sport a second sort of specialised tooth behind those canines. These have frilled cusps which resemble combs. At the time, nobody knew what to make of them. But Dr Watanabe speculated that they might be an adaptation for feeding on other strange creatures dwelling in the lake.
Seals arrived in Baikal 2m years ago, from the Arctic Ocean. So too did some much smaller marine creatures, known as amphipods. These have diversified into more than 340 indigenous species. One of them, Macrohectopus branickii, spends its days hiding in the depths of the lake and then forages in the shallows at night in great numbers.
Marine mammals the size of seals would normally see amphipods as too small to hunt. But Dr Watanabe wondered if the Baikal seals' comblike teeth might have evolved to enable them to rake these tiny crustaceans from the water in sufficient quantities to make them useful prey-much as some whales collect krill using comblike structures called baleen plates. He and his colleagues therefore attached waterproof video cameras and accelerometers to a few seals, to monitor what they were getting up to. This equipment remained attached to the animals for between two and four days, before coming loose and floating to the lake's surface, whence the researchers were able to recover it.
Footage from the cameras and data from the accelerometers showed that the seals were indeed pursuing the dense amphipod aggregations that form at night. They would dive in with their mouths open and collect prey before making another pass. Dr Watanabe estimates that each seal captures an average of 57 amphipods per dive-and thus thousands of them a day. The needlelike canines are not redundant, for the seals do hunt fish as well. But they also compete with those fish for the amphipods, thus partially bypassing a link in the food chain and perhaps thereby maintaining themselves in larger numbers than would otherwise be possible.
Whether, were some of these filterfeeding seals to make it back to the ocean, they would follow the baleenwhale path and evolve into giants, is an interesting speculation. But even confined to their lake, Baikal seals provide an intriguing example of parallel evolution."

Like the pandemic-hit celebrations of his jubilee, Beethoven's career was a struggle against adversity
In december i8o8 Ludwig van Beethoven amazed Vienna with a four-hour, selfpromoted concert. It included premieres of his Fifth and Sixth symphonies, and of his Fourth Piano Concerto. Shortly afterwards the gruff maestro seemed to have crowned his long search for a stable income with an annuity worth 4,000 florins from Archduke Rudolph of Austria and two other aristocrats. He contemplated marriage and set to work on his next concerto.
Then Napoleon Bonaparte's forces attacked and occupied the city for the second time in four years. Beethoven, who lived in the line of fire, cowered in his brother's basement as he tried to protect his already damaged hearing from the din. Worse, his patrons failed to pay up. Distraught and anxious, he wrote of the ""destructive, disorderly life"" around him, ""nothing but drums, cannons and human misery"".
Beethoven was born 250 years ago (his exact birthday is uncertain). Almost from the time he left his native Bonn for Vienna in 1792, setbacks disrupted the keyboard virtuoso's promising career. Hearing loss struck in 1798, not a quiet slide into silence but an incessant ""squealing, buzzing and humming"" in the ears. In 1802 he considered suicide, writing that ""it was only my art that held me back"".
Yet that art quickly mastered the formal beauty and decorum of Haydn and Mozart before moving into an entirely new realm of innovation and unshackled self-expression. Completed in 1804, his Third Symphony, the ""Eroica"", broadcast this leap to a thunderstruck public, alarming some listeners (""strident and bizarre""), transfixing others (""true genius""). By 1810 the Fifth Symphony was being hailed as a landmark in world culture-a gospel of Romantic feeling that ""opens up to us the kingdom of the gigantic and the immeasurable"".
Knock him down, and Beethoven would bounce back with another stupendous coup. By 1824 the critic Adolph Marx could write that the composer's style bore witness to ""the struggle of a strong being against an almost overwhelming fate"". It is fitting, then, that the global celebrations of his jubilee have been marked by dismay, resilience and resurrection.
The festivities began before the pandemic struck. Based in Bonn, the bthvn25o programme scheduled hundreds of events in Germany. Vienna, where Beethoven lived without much affection for 35 years-""From the emperor to the bootblack, all the Viennese are worthless""-forgave the slights to offer exhibitions and concerts galore. In Brazil Marin Alsop, an American conductor, launched her ""Global Ode to Joy"" project, planned performances of the heaven-storming Ninth Symphony on six continents. Opera houses prepared to raise the curtain on ""Fidelio"", Beethoven's only opera and an evergreen hymn to freedom. ""Oh what bliss, to breathe freely in the open air,"" sing a chorus of prisoners, in a scene to melt the iciest heart. Then they return to their cells.
This spring, the whole world followed them. Lockdowns forced the anniversary ringmasters to tear up their plans. ""Beethoven had to reinvent himself again and again,"" notes Malte Boecker, director of bthvn25o. His acolytes followed suit. Events were postponed; performances 1 ? moved online. Yet ""audience numbers grew and grew. It became like a snowball,"" says Mr Boecker. The ""Beethoven Pastoral Project"", inspired by his bucolic Sixth Symphony, became a virtual network of artists, already reaching a global audience of 30m.
The composer would have winced in recognition. The chronic insecurity faced by musicians today is ""very close to the situation in Beethoven's time"", Mr Boecker notes. War with France raged with little respite from 1792 to 1815; inflation shrank earnings; publishers, promoters and patrons went bust. Laura Tunbridge, professor of music at Oxford and author of a new biography, ""Beethoven: A Life in Nine Pieces"", underlines her subject's role as ""one of the early freelancers"", a hard-nosed jobbing professional.
Lurching between court and market, prosperity and penury, he worked on the cusp between the old musical regime of noble and royal patronage, and the new order of commercial publishing and concert promotion. Between 1809 and 1812 he earned 6,000 florins a year, six times an average civil-service salary. But he ran through it fast and complained that ""I have not a farthing left."" His grandest pieces, such as the Ninth Symphony and ""Missa Solemnis"", are timeless monuments to genius. They were also properties that Beethoven pitched aggressively (and often simultaneously) to rival publishers. Those two went to Schott and Sons of Mainz for 1,600 florins.
The one and only
He let the snobby Viennese presume the ""van"" in his Flemish surname denoted noble descent. (It didn't.) But he despised most aristocrats and, embracing his celebrity status, was not shy about telling them. ""Of princes there have been and will be thousands,"" he wrote to Prince Lichnowsky, one of his patrons, after a quarrel. ""Of Beethovens there is only one."" When he and Goethe encountered Austrian royalty at a Bohemian spa, Goethe doffed his hat and bowed; Beethoven strode on, telling the superstar author, ""You did those yonder too much honour."" Like many other children of the Enlightenment, he was filled with hope, then rage, by Napoleon's ascent from the chaos of post-revolutionary France. Famously and furiously, he scratched out the dedication of the ""Eroica"" to Napoleon when the Corsican declared himself emperor.
Like America's Founding Fathers, Beethoven was a republican idealist, not a modern democrat. He once said that he ""never believed"" in the dictum ""Vox populi, vox Dei"" (""The people's voice is the voice of God""). To the ears of posterity, though, Beethoven's music means heroic liberation and human solidarity. The ominous blows that launch the Fifth Symphony became the Morse-code ""V"" for victory during the second world war. Leonard Bernstein conducted the Ninth in Berlin as the Wall came down in 1989.
Now, with massed choirs banned on health grounds, such barnstorming showpieces remain unstageable in Europe. In place of the towering icon, an intimate, informal Beethoven has flourished during his plague-hit jubilee year. Ms Tunbridge notes the vogue for small-scale arrangements of his music. Igor Levit, a pianist, has gathered a worldwide audience for concerts streamed from his flat in Berlin.
On December 17th-the date of Beethoven's baptism in 1770-Daniel Barenboim is due to conduct the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Bonn; bthvn250 hopes that this flagship concert can go ahead, now as a prelude to delayed commemorations rather than a climax. Suntory Hall in Tokyo still promises several performances of the ""Daiku"" (Number Nine), which German pows introduced to Japan in 1918. But as an anniversary anthem in these queasy, isolated times, Mr Boecker recommends not the ecstatic joy of the Ninth but the humbler ""Heiliger Dankgesang""-the heartfelt ""song of thanksgiving"" from a late string quartet, composed during convalescence. Fate has amplified Beethoven's voice not as a struggler, but as a healer. *"

Perestroika in Paris. By Jane Smiley. Knopf; 288 pages; $26.95
This eccentric novel could not be more different from Jane Smiley's best known book and her most recent ones. ""A Thousand Acres (1991), which won a Pulitzer, was an audacious retelling of ""King Lear featuring an Iowan farmer and his three daughters. ""Some Luck (2014), ""Early Warning (2015) and ""Golden Age (2015), known collectively as the ""Last Hundred Years trilogy, tracked the fortunes of another Iowan farming family across several generations. In ""Perestroika in Paris Ms Smiley swaps the Midwest for France and, for the most part, people for animals.
This Perestroika is not a Soviet policy but a racehorse-Paras for short. After finishing first at Auteuil racecourse, the ""curious filly trots out of her open stall and gambols off into the City of Light.
She encounters Frida, a streetwise German short-haired pointer, lonely since the death of the busker who owned her. They bond with a polyglot raven called Raoul, who takes them under his wing and off to the green expanse of the Champ de Mars where they pool resources and live in peace.
Gradually, humans intrude. Pierre is head gardener of their urban idyll, Anais a baker who keeps Paras in oats. Étienne, an eight-year-old orphan, gives the animals refuge at his great-grandmother's house as snow falls and Christmas approaches. But when Étienne's aged relative dies and Paras is reunited with her groom and trainer, the future looks uncertain for the ragtag group of friends.
Ms Smiley has employed anthropomorphism before. ""Moo (1995) lampooned academia; ""Horse Heaven (2000) sent up horse-racing. But ""Perestroika in Paris is no satire, nor a foray into surrealism or magical realism. Rather it is an immersive fable. Through the unlikely alliance and beguiling adventures of her runaway horse, stray dog and know-it-all raven (plus two rats and a pair of mallards) Ms Smiley explores themes of diversity, loyalty, fellowship and freedom. Along the way her animals wryly comment on the oddities of human behaviour: ""Quite often they flock together in large, bright rooms, Raoul explains, ""and then they plume themselves and establish rankings.
Deeper undercurrents of menace or moments of panic would have given the yarn more edge. But in general Ms Smiley avoids excessive whimsy and sentimentality to deliver a comforting read at the end of a difficult year-a winter's tale full of wit, warmth and charm."

In may 193з Maurice Wilson, a first-worldwar veteran, took off from Stag Lane aerodrome in north London. He had resolved to fly his Gipsy Moth, a single-engine biplane, 6,000 miles to Mount Everest, crash-land on its lower slopes and ascend the thenunconquered mountain-alone. He had only 19 hours of flight-training under his belt, and ""had hardly climbed anything more challenging than a flight of stairs"".
Ed Caesar tells this irresistibly quixotic tale in ""The Moth and the Mountain""-a rollicking biography of an eccentric adventurer, and a sensitive study of the pressures that drove him. War was the defining fact of Wilson's life. As Wade Davis argued in ""Into the Silence"", his account of the early Everest expeditions, for the men involved the perils of high-altitude climbing paled beside the carnage of the Western Front. They were a generation inoculated by trauma. On average, a second lieutenant (Wilson's rank) survived for about six weeks; his battalion lost over 400 men in a single night. At 20 he won the Military Cross for bravery, but was shot in 1918 and repatriated.
In the ""topsy turvy"" world of peace he was shell-shocked and rootless. He ""lost the thread of his own story"", writes Mr Caesar. Everest promised to give Wilson's life a new plot. He was enthralled by previous British attempts on the mountain, the best known of which, in 1924, led to the death of George Mallory, the era's finest alpinist, high on its slopes. Those early climbers saw in the ""third pole"" of Everest a kind of vindication for the empire; to Wilson it suggested a more personal deliverance.
Unlike the airy and ill-prepared Wilson, Mr Caesar, a journalist at the New Yorker, grounds his story in patient archival sleuthing. Marrying extracts from Wilson's letters and diaries with lively prose, he winningly conveys the glamour and contradictions of this outlandish figure, bringing cinematic vividness to his escapades. The maximum range of Wilson's aeroplane was 750 miles, so he was forced to hopscotch between scrubby imperial outposts as Whitehall pen-pushers-fearing the ""loud-mouthed aviator"" would cause a diplomatic incident-tried to stop him. But his cunning and ironclad jauntiness delivered him to the foot of the mountain, and his inevitable fate.
Despite these enticing details, Wilson's motivations remain obscure. As Mr Caesar admits, the ""slippery rock face"" of his life shrugs off the most agile biographer. Apart from a few telling cracks of introspection and self-doubt, his writings are a smooth wall of what-ho bravado. Evidently he was damaged by his military service, but the deeper principles which guided him are a blur. Mr Caesar tentatively points to the influence of esoteric religious beliefs that flourished in the turbulence of the postwar era. An unusual relationship with a married woman, Enid Evans, was clearly important, too. He even touches on the somewhat shaky rumours that Wilson was a secret transvestite.
Yet these speculations bring readers no closer to the man himself. ""You imagine"", ""you can almost see"": Mr Caesar increasingly resorts to these hopeful conjectures. ""Sometimes, Wilson seems distant and ancient,"" he writes towards the end. ""At others, he is so close that you can hear him."" Hypothermic and huddling in a tent blasted by icy winds, Wilson signed off his final letter with a characteristic ""Cheerio"". *"

In Liverpool, a French observer marvelled in 1907, ""one feels one is in contact with America, Australia, west Africa, the Far East, at the same time as with Germany and France. There one is at the commercial centre of the world.""
This remark neatly captures the subject of John Darwin's new book. He tracks a century of what he calls ""steam globalisation"", when steamships and railways drove a dramatic acceleration in the exchange of goods, people, ideas and money across the world. Faster and cheaper transport seemed to shrink the globe; the volume of world trade and foreign investment soared. Mr Darwin shows how major port cities were both products of these transformations and agents of change. In the great opening up of the world that is his subject, the port cities were the hinges.
The current era of globalisation, the author notes, is not unique but the latest in a series that have built on each other in a cumulative, though not neatly linear, fashion. In the mercantile system that sprang up in the wake of the voyages of Ibn Battuta, Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama, Asia was the world's workshop and Europe relatively peripheral.
Then coal, readily available in Europe, fuelled what historians have called the ""Great Divergence"" of the 18th century, whereby Europe (and later North America) came to dominate. By describing the evolution and sometimes decline of a number of major port cities, most compellingly London, Bombay, Singapore and New York, Mr Darwin shows how this process worked.
Singapore, for instance, grew exponentially, and played a central role in the industrialisation of tin and rubber production in its maritime hinterland of Malaysia. New Orleans rose in importance with the Mississippi riverboat steamer, only to decline as railway connections to Baltimore and New York changed the dynamics of American trade once more. Trieste enjoyed a brief heyday as the Austro-Hungarian Empire's main seaport, before collapsing abruptly into romantic obscurity after 1918.
Mr Darwin takes globalisation to mean primarily ""economic connectedness between different parts of the world"". That is a reasonable but limited definition, missing the ascent in the 19th century of ideologies such as nationalism and socialism that purported to explain social relations around the world. Rising sciences such as geology and palaeontology had a similarly broad scope. ""Unlocking"" the world, meanwhile, is a vivid metaphor, but it implies a smooth, even inevitable process. In reality the world's doors were not just unlocked, but often kicked down. Mr Darwin knows this, and stresses the influence of geopolitics and imperialism, not just free trade as an abstract concept. But he might have depicted the bootprints more graphically.
Still, his book is an enjoyable synthesis of a large body of scholarship. He closes by remarking that today's globalisation is not simply a bigger, faster version of what happened in the steam age. As in the earlymodern period, Asia is once again the workshop of the world. He wonders if there is another parallel, however. In 1914 the European-dominated global economic system seemed irresistible. Then war intervened. Will a systemic crisis break the current cycle of globalisation, too? *"

It is a fair bet that most readers of The Economist will not have thought of the Antichrist for a while. That does not mean, however, that this figure has gone away. Ever since early Christian thinkers decided that the evil in the world needed a focus, a project and a name, in order to be decisively defeated at the Second Coming, this shape-shifting form has hovered around.
He was Rosemary's baby in the film of that name, engendered on Rosemary by Satan and with ""his father's eyes"". He was Damien in the ""Omen"" movies, born of a female jackal and eventually American ambassador to the Court of St James's. In the ""Left Behind"" books he is Nicolae Carpathia, secretary-general of the UN-turned commander of the One World Unity Army. Depending on your politics, the ultimate foe of QAnon may be the Antichrist, or Xi Jinping may be, or the New York Times; for institutions are fingered as the Antichrist as often as men are. And since its appearance signifies the end-times, when apocalyptic events will be unloosed upon the world and Christ will return to sort it all out, it is all too plausibly the Antichrist's moment now, with wildfires, plague and climate change all converging. It might be good to know, one way or the other.
But as Philip Almond explains in this entertaining romp through the subject, that is just the problem. It is very difficult to spot him, or it. Christians who felt dutybound to keep permanent watch-and they included Isaac Newton and the young John Henry Newman, as well as John Knox and other usual suspects-squabbled among themselves over whether the Antichrist was an individual, in which case Nero, Simon Magus and Napoleon were popular, or a crowd, in which case the Turks were longtime favourites, or simply the evil that battles good in the breast of every human being. The book of Revelation, which does not mention the Antichrist by name, provided a whole menagerie of aliases and clues, from the Whore of Babylon to the seventh head of the dragon rising from the sea. The number of the Beast, 666, could be precisely found in the names of Popes Innocent IV and Benedict XI-and in the timing of Queen Victoria's accession.
Amid all this, Martin Luther's cleareyed certainty that the papacy was the Antichrist comes as a gale of fresh air. It was a surprisingly old claim, first made in 1190 by Joachim of Fiore, and taken up with increasing enthusiasm as the Catholic church embroiled itself in simony, sexual deviance and the sale of indulgences. The theory behind it was that the Antichrist was not a tyrant skulking outside Christendom, picking believers off, but a malign influence working within it, even right at the heart and at the top. This was not a problem for some future apocalyptic time (though that time was exhaustively worried over, to the very week and day), but an abomination that was here, and pressing.
The essence of this lurking Antichrist was deception, especially of the faithful. This explains why medieval paintings often show the Son of Perdition as a benevolent prince, crowned and robed, or even as a double for Jesus, bearded, thoughtful and working miracles. Evil was ever-beguiling, and drew plenty of willing followers. The alternative-to make the Antichrist utterly monstrous and vile, as on this book's cover, where William Blake makes a horned cadaver of him-puts the enemy in plain sight, and lets Christians off too easily from vetting their own behaviour.
The search for the Antichrist leads Mr Almond down many obscure paths, peopled by cobwebbed theologians such as Irenaeus and Hippolytus, and deep into the weirdest thickets of medieval fantasyweaving. He has fun-""Sexy Beast"" is his heading on a section about the Antichrist visions, peculiarly like ink blots, of Hildegard of Bingen-but does not forget that a modern reader also needs to know why the Antichrist was important. The problem he, or it, was invented to solve was that Christ had promised to return to the world and establish his kingdom, but had not done so yet. Christians needed to believe that a great showdown between good and evil was, however, coming. Satan himself had already been sent to hell, but his thoroughly demonised spawn was working in the world. The faithful had to be kept alert to the dark deviousness around them.
Does the idea have any relevance now, when the word seems merely quaint to anyone outside the tradition of prophetic Christianity? Mr Almond likes to think it does. If the great eschatological conflict and the triumph of good are dispensed with, history and human existence may seem to have no purpose. ""Cosmic nihilism"" is all that is left. By contrast, the story of the Antichrist encourages men and women to give their own lives meaning, at least: to be aware of the evil in themselves and to cultivate the good.
To this reviewer, the whole strange story cuts the other way. The usefulness of the Antichrist today is surely as a swift and comprehensive way to displace evil onto others-when in reality, in the words of the 17th-century radical Ranter, Joseph Salmon, ""this great whore is in thee."" *"

Golf has a length problem. The farther players drive the ball, the longer holes need to be, so that skills like iron play and putting remain important. But the longer courses are, the more they cost to maintain and the worse their environmental impact. They also become more daunting for recreational golfers, who keep them in business.
In 2004 golf's regulators introduced limits on the size of clubs, hoping to slow the trend of ever-longer drives. Nonetheless, the pin-flation has continued apace. On November 15th a famous record tumbled: someone completed the Masters Tournament in fewer than 270 strokes, the mark Tiger Woods set when he won his first major title in 1997. The new low of 268 belongs to Dustin Johnson, a burly driver who has averaged more than 300 yards (274 metres) a pop throughout his career. He achieved the feat even though the Augusta National course is 8% longer than in 1997.
How have golfers continued to blast the ball farther than ever? The pga Tour, the top men's circuit, publishes ball-tracking statistics based on the flight of most drives in tournaments since 2007. These suggest that, although better equipment may have helped, players' recent gains stem largely from their technique-and even bigger improvements now appear inevitable.
The data come from ShotLink, a system that tracks how fast a golfer swings (""clubhead speed), his ball's trajectory (""launch angle) and its rotation speed (""spin rate). After taking each player's average value for these metrics in each year, we built a statistical model using them to predict driving distances. Together, the three factors explained 70% of the differences between players' distances, and almost all of the increase in length over time.
The model's lessons are intuitive. To thump the ball as far as possible, maximise clubhead speed and launch angle while minimising spin (which causes the ball to soar higher, rather than racing forward). However, most players face a trade-off between these goals, explains Paul Wood of Ping, a club manufacturer. Harder impacts usually mean flatter trajectories. Although the average male player swings faster and produces less spin than in 2007, launch angles have declined since then.
One golfer, however, has escaped this constraint. Bryson DeChambeau, a physics graduate with oddly designed clubs and a voracious appetite for data, is nicknamed the ""Mad Scientist. While the pga Tour was suspended because of covid-19, he added 18kg (40lbs) of bulk. This has allowed him to swing faster than anyone else. But he has also managed to smash the ball with a high launch angle, rather than a low one-an unprecedented combination that might owe something to his unusually stiff wrists and robotic technique. Using both his brains and his brawn, Mr DeChambeau is now hitting 15 yards farther than his closest competitors do. He won his first major title at the us Open in September.
Mark Broadie, a professor at Columbia University and golf statistician, reckons that other professionals will try to beef up. But golf history is littered with players who lost their edge after tinkering with their swings. And time may yet show that the risks of Mr DeChambeau's bombs-away approach offset some of the rewards. He strayed into the rough often at the Masters.
Nonetheless, the Mad Scientist's breakthrough is bad news for course designers. They will probably have to keep fiddling with their fairways for years to come. *"

Every morning he could, Jonathan Sacks pulled on his tracksuit and went out jogging. He was not called the ""rapid rabbi for nothing. Jogging, as his desk-sign reminded him, led to positive thinking. And, thanks to his noise-cancelling earphones, it brought him peace. He heard nothing as he ran but Schubert, Beethoven, or whoever it might be. Those same earphones-one of the best purchases he had ever made-also enabled him when he meditated to hear the music of creation, the quiet voice of wisdom within it, and his response, from his spontaneous waking ""Modeh Ani, ""I give thanks, onwards.
Otherwise, the noise was hard to lose. Every year the voices became more strident and extreme. Consumerism cried ""I want! I want! Individualism cried ""Me! Me! My choices, my feelings! until even the iPhone and iPad he used all the time vexed him with their ""I, I, I. Society had become a cacophony of competing claims. The world gave every sign of falling apart. Even religion, his business, could be a megaphone of hate. He never felt that more strongly than when he stood in January 2002 at Ground Zero in Manhattan, with the ground still smoking round him.
His answer, as the leader of the Orthodox Jews of Britain and also as a moral philosopher, was to raise his own voice. Over his term of office, from i99ito 2013, he became famous both outside Judaism and outside Britain for his speeches, his lectures (including stints at New York University and Yeshiva University), his three dozen books and his three-minute sermons on bbc Radio 4's earlymorning ""Thought for the Day. A rabbi was, after all, a teacher. He was a clear, kind one, still with a touch of East End about him-his father had sold shmatters, clothes, in Petticoat Lane, and when he was made a peer in 2009 he took the title ""Baron Aldgate. But he was also firm, even stern. He wanted to leave his mostly secular listeners in no doubt that things were good or evil, true or false, absolutely, and that moral relativism was the scourge of the age.
Judaism, as he pointed out, often provided antidotes to the chaos. The Torah, God's will revealed in words, was an algorithm that gave discipline to life. Keeping Shabbat was an ideal way to achieve work-life balance. The festivals and High Holy Days reminded Jews of their shared traditions and history: the ""we, not the ""I. Above all, out of the suffering endured by Jews for centuries, Judaism had distilled hope. Every crisis gave birth to opportunity. The world could be changed not by force, but by ideas.
Unhappily, though, much of the raucousness that dogged him came from Jews themselves. Though non-Jews saw him as the spokesman for all the Jews of Britain, officially he was the leader of only an Orthodox minority, the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. A much larger number, Reform and Liberal and ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, were outside his purview, but still looked to him. Pleasing everyone was impossible. His intellectual instincts, honed at Church of England schools and Cambridge rather than religious shuls, were on the liberal side, and in that spirit he made services more lively and revised the daily prayer book, translating the Hebrew from scratch. But in practice it was the Haredi he found himself placating most: avoiding gay groups, doing little to advance the role of women, and-his most regrettable mistake-refusing to attend the funeral of a much-loved Reform rabbi, Hugo Gryn, and calling him a destroyer of the faith. ""A great chief rabbi-to the Gentiles, a fair number said, noting his easier mixing with prime ministers and royals. The Haredi, not won over, called him ""Boychik, wet behind the ears.
Perhaps he was. He never set out to be a rabbi; the impulse had grown very slowly, from that first sense of the mystery of God, when he was two or three, in the sadness of the music at his grandfather's tiny synagogue in Finchley. He did not even feel especially Jewish until, at Cambridge, the Six-Day War of 1967 suddenly fuelled a lifelong attachment to Israel. He spent the next summer criss-crossing America on a Greyhound bus to look for rabbis, and Menachem Mendel Schneerson in Brooklyn, then the Lubavitcher rebbe, was the first to suggest he might be one himself and train others. Still he wavered, wondering about accountancy. In the end, in the mid-1970s, it was a voice in his head that made him say-as Abraham, ordered to sacrifice his son Isaac, had said three times to God-""Hineni, ""Here I am.
The task of uniting his co-religionists paled, of course, beside the collapse of society, but this too he had to address. Every man and woman had a duty to care for others, and thus to recreate the bonds that held society together. ""I had to give way to ""we. Out of great crises-climate change, coronavirus-that chance might come. Ideally religion could drive this change, with the world's faiths uniting, as they had done, imams and gurus, priests and rabbis, at Ground Zero that day. But his argument in ""The Dignity of Difference that all the major religions were equally valid ways to truth had caused even more trouble with the Haredi. Instead, in his last book, he called for a shared morality: agreed norms of behaviour, mutual trust, altruism, and a sense of ""all-of-us-together. The liberty craved by ""me could be sustained only by ""us.
It was a very long shot, but he was not a pessimist. Part of his job was to cheer people up, and he liked to wear a yellow tie, like sunshine, for his public lectures. If he felt depressed, music soon lifted him out of it. So, too, did his studies. If he was stranded on a desert island, he told a bbc interviewer, he hoped it could be with all 20 volumes of the Talmud and plenty of pencils, in order to write commentaries in the margins. Meanwhile, thinking and writing in his garden study in Golders Green, with or without his invaluable earphones, he could escape the shouting world a little.
On a visit he made once to Auschwitz, as he wept and asked, like so many others, where God had been in the Holocaust, he seemed to hear an answer: ""I was in the words. The words were ""You shall not murder. If human beings refused to listen to God, even He was helpless. But if much of the noise that humans made could be cancelled out, they might more often hear what He was saying. *"

This week's spending review shows how a combination of covid-19 and Boris Johnson's promises are straining public finances
Richard holden is proving expensive. In the election last December, he became the first Conservative to represent the seat of North West Durham, a sprawling constituency of farms and former mining towns, since it was created in 1950. Since then he has been promised a new hospital, and in March won a tax-cut for motorhomes which will benefit the local campervan factory and cost the exchequer £25m a year over five years. In the spending review on November 25th, the government said it would conduct a study into replacing a railway which was shut in 1963. Mr Holden is also eyeing government funds for a new bus network, some new footpaths and cycle ways, better broadband and a new leisure centre.
Boris Johnson is keen to please Mr Holden, for his seat is one of the so-called ""red wall"" formerly Labour constituencies in northern England, the Midlands and Wales that flipped blue in the general election. If people there are to stick with the Tories they will need to see their area changing, says Mr Holden. ""I want to be able to go to the next election and say we've delivered this, we've had progress on this, and this is in the pipeline. It's the fling versus the marriage question-we have to show real commitment to our towns and villages.""
The manifesto on which Mr Johnson won was written in sunnier times. It bound together a wide Conservative coalition with the glue of low borrowing costs and benign economic conditions. It promised to ""level up"" the gap between southern England and seats such as Mr Holden's with a flood of spending on roads and railways, hospitals and green energy. Yet this would be done without hiking payroll taxes and VAT-a red line for Mr Johnson's existing stock of southern Tories-and while cutting the national debt. Britain's commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on foreign aid would stay, despite its unpopularity with Tory activists, to keep the party's dwindling liberal wing happy.
Covid-19 will force Mr Johnson to break some of those promises, and strain his coalition. That became clear in the spending review Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, announced on November 25th. The economy, he said, would shrink by 11.3%-the biggest contraction in 300 years. The spending plans reflect both the demands that the emergency has placed on the public sector (see chart 1 on next page) and the government's political priorities.
A lot of money is being spent on keeping mps such as Mr Holden happy. The government knows that the Labour Party cannot return to power without winning back their seats. Those mps are relentless lobbyists, organised around a caucus known as the Northern Research Group. Partly in order to pay for their shopping lists, public sector net investment will hover just below 3% of GDP in the years after the crisis, higher than in all but two years since the 1970s.
The bit of the coalition that was thrown overboard this week was the shrinking band of liberals. They were outraged when Mr Sunak said he would, after all, abandon Britain's foreign-aid commitment. David Cameron, the former prime minister who enshrined that commitment in law, had embraced development as part of a ""compassionate conservatism"" agenda. Liz Sugg, a development minister and former aide to Mr Cameron, quit.
How much further the coalition is strained depends largely on the prospects for recovery. They are highly uncertain. In its forecasts accompanying the review the 1 ? Office for Budget Responsibility, a fiscal watchdog, set out three scenarios in which the economy regains its pre-pandemic size at the end of 2021, 2022 and 2024 respectively, depending on the path of the virus and the success of the vaccine. So severe and strange has the shock to the economy been that ""there is no reasonable basis for forming a view on the likelihood of any particular outcome,"" it warned.
The public finances are equally hard to predict, with projected budget deficits in 2025-26 ranging from 1.7% to 6.1% of gdp (see chart 2). And that is without taking into account the possible effect of completing the transition out of the European Union in January. A ""no deal"" exit would worsen those forecasts. The range of possible paths for the economy next year is simply enormous.
Mr Sunak warned that fiscal consolidation may eventually be necessary. He ened the only slightly, but those measures hint at rows to come. Public-sector workers, other than those in the National Health Service and the lowest paid, will see their pay frozen for a year-meaning a real-terms cut once inflation is taken into account. Local authorities will get less from the government in grants, making them more reliant on council-tax revenue, which will be toughest for poor areas. That risks leaving Mr Johnson vulnerable to the charge of a return to austerity in his new, working-class seats. A £20-a-week increase in unemployment benefits put in place during the pandemic will be reviewed in the new year. Beyond
that lie harder choices, which will upset other bits of the coalition. Its southern mps in particular are allergic to tax rises, and are mobilising to warn Mr Sunak against touching taxes on profits, capital gains or pensions. David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, has urged him to fuse the doctrines of Reagan and Roosevelt: steep tax cuts and big spending on infrastructure, funded by cheap borrowing. The
government can take confidence from the fact that, despite massive borrowing, which will reach a peacetime record of 19% of gdp this year, low interest rates mean that the cost of servicing its debt will fall this year. Yet despite the appetite for spending in its new seats, the Conservative Party does not like borrowing. The party's foot-soldiers view the public purse like a household's finances, while mps worry that the public finances are vulnerable if interest rates do rise. There
are sound tactical reasons for taking this view, too. The Tories have kept the Labour Party out of office for a decade by maintaining that only they can control public spending. If voters come to believe that governments can borrow without limits, Mr Sunak warns mps, there is no reason for them not to vote Labour. Even red-wallers like Mr Holden see the case for prudence. ""The worst thing we could possibly do is make irresponsible promises to people, which we can never deliver on,"" he says. Uniting a disparate coalition of old and new Tories was possible in good times. After covid-19, a government forced to choose between spending, taxes and debt will find it much harder. *"

Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet Muhammad bin Salman, the powerful crown prince. There was no hint that the Saudi regime was about to recognise Israel. Rather, the meeting seemed intended to warn Iran to restrain its nuclear programme or risk a military strike, and to hint to Joe Biden that the two will oppose significant shifts in policy on the Middle East.
Iran released Kylie MooreGilbert, a British-Australian academic detained in 2018 and convicted of espionage in a secret trial. She was reportedly swapped for Iranians arrested abroad. Separately Iran said it will soon execute Ahmadreza Djalali, an Iranian-Swedish doctor, convicted in an unfair trial on charges that were brought after he refused to spy for the government.
Nicolas Sarkozy, president of France from 2007-12, went on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling. He is charged with having tried to bribe a judge by promising assistance for a promotion in return for information about an investigation into him.
France's lower house passed a bill that would make it illegal to share images of police for ""malicious purposes"". This law, if also passed by the Senate, would make it harder to expose police brutality. Brussels is taking a look.
Donald Trump at last directed federal agencies to co-operate with the transfer of power to Joe Biden. The president's refusal to do so had hindered the flow of classified information and other material to Mr Biden. Mr Trump also pardoned Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi during the Mueller investigation. Mr Trump is still contesting the election result, without success.
Mr Biden started choosing his team, picking Antony Blinken, who worked in Barack Obama's administration, as his secretary of state. Avril Haines, another Obama veteran, is to be the director of national intelligence; Jake Sullivan, a former aide to Mr Biden, national security adviser. He also created a new position of special envoy on climate change. The job went to John Kerry, who signed the Paris accord in 2015 as Mr Obama's secretary of state. In 2019 Mr Kerry started an initiative to hold politicians accountable if they fail to reduce emissions.
Joshua Wong, a prominent activist in Hong Kong, was remanded in custody after pleading guilty to charges relating to last year's prodemocracy unrest in the city. Also detained were two leaders of Mr Wong's now-disbanded political group, Demosisto: Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam. The three are expected to be sentenced next month.

Authorities in Singapore charged Jolovan Wham, a civil-rights activist, with disturbing public order for briefly holding up a sign with a smiley face on it. They maintain the act was an illegal protest.
Police in Thailand summoned 12 of the leaders of ongoing protests around the country in connection with an investigation into lese-majesté. The protesters have called for reforms to the monarchy.
Thousands of Guatemalans protested against the budget passed by the country's Congress. Some set fire to Congress itself. They were angry that the budget included extra money for congressmen's meal allowances but less for the judiciary, malnutrition and health. Congress backed down.
Mexico's Senate voted for a bill to legalise cannabis for recreational use. It would permit users to have up to 28g of cannabis and allow them to grow up to four plants at home. If the bill passes the lower house of Congress Mexico would become the third country, after Uruguay and Canada, to legalise cannabis fully for recreational use nationwide.
Diego Maradona, one of the best footballers of all time, died, aged 60. Short of stature, a dazzling dribbler and scorer of marvellous goals, Mr Maradona inspired Argentina, his national team, to victory in the World Cup in 1986 (with a bit of help from his miraculous ""hand of God""). He also struggled with addictions to cocaine and alcohol.
Several Asian countries, including Japan, Malaysia and South Korea, reported an increase in cases. In Japan the government suspended a campaign in some areas to encourage people to travel.
Some European countries outlined plans to ease restrictions over Christmas. In Britain three households will be able to meet up over a five-day period. France will start reopening shops on November 28th and most other restrictions will end on December 15th. Restaurants will remain closed until January 20th, however. Germany went in the other direction and tightened its measures until at least December 20th.
The Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria reopened their border. It was shut in July, and flights between Sydney and Melbourne cancelled, amid a surge of the virus in Victoria. After a rigid lockdown, it has reported no new cases for several weeks.

In one course of treatment that rises to 90%, close to the efficacy of the other two recent vaccine successes, though questions have been raised about the data behind AstraZeneca's trial. Its jab is expected to be cheaper and easier to distribute globally. Three billion doses could be ready next year.
The good news on vaccines is one factor that has pushed stockmarkets into new territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the 30,000 mark for the first time and is on course for its best monthly gain since 1987. The s&p 500 hit a new record; it is up by more than 10% this month.
Mellow Yellen
The growing probability of a smooth transfer of power to Joe Biden also cheered investors. His choice of Janet Yellen as treasury secretary was seen as a safe bet. The former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve should pass her confirmation hearing in the Senate, even if it remains under Republican control. Her first task will be to help craft a new stimulus bill.
One of the clearest signs yet that businesses are adapting to the new administration came from General Motors. The carmaker is withdrawing its support from the current government's legal challenge to California's vehicle-emission standards, the toughest in America. Mr Biden will bring in ""ambitious"" targets when he takes office, when he will also have a new climate tsar.
Tesla's share price soared again, following the news that it is to be included in the s&p 500 index from next month, which means tracker funds will be obliged to buy its stock. The electric-car maker's market capitalisation raced past $500bn this week. That is more than five times the combined value of gm and Ford.
Rishi Sunak, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, produced his spending review, which was as grim as expected. Mr Sunak noted that the emergency had ""only just begun"", forecasting that borrowing will be £394bn ($530bn) this year, or 19% of GDP, which would be the highest deficit in peacetime. In addition to a public-sector pay freeze he also took a swipe at foreign aid, by abandoning a policy of spending 0.7% of national income on it.
With the roll-out of vaccines for covid-19 on the horizon, airlines announced a raft of measures that they hope will make flying easier. Qantas became the first big carrier to suggest that it may ask passengers to prove they have had a vaccination before boarding a plane. Five airlines, including United and Lufthansa, said they would offer a ""common pass"" to travellers who have tested negative. American airports had their busiest weekend since March, handling more than 3m people ahead of Thanksgiving.
The good news about vaccines also spurred a rally in oil markets. Brent crude rose above $48 a barrel, its highest price since early March, before markets went into meltdown over the coronavirus.
Bertelsmann emerged the winner in a bidding war for Simon & Schuster, the publishing arm of ViacomcBS. Bertelsmann, which owns Penguin Random House, is paying $2.2bn for the firm, though getting the deal completed will be a page turner. Regulators will look closely at the rationale for combining the publishers, which would have a third of the American market.
The drastic slowdown in global human activity because of covid-19 has led to only a ""tiny blip"" in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. Emissions may have been reduced by between 4% and 7.5% for the whole of the year relative to 2019, but CO2 remains in the atmosphere for centuries, so any amount of emissions contributes to a build-up. According to the WMO this year's ""blip"" will be no bigger than normal annual fluctuations.
Showing that America is not the only country that has a problem with Chinese tech firms, India's government banned another 43 apps that it said were ""prejudicial"" to the country's ""sovereignty and integrity"". Tension along the Himalayan border between China and India has risen since June and Delhi has banned 200 Chinese apps in all, in what it describes as a ""digital strike"".
Move over Hollywood
Netflix announced that it would spend $1bn on expanding its studios in Albuquerque, creating one of the largest film-production sites in North America. Ten new stages, backlots and other facilities will generate 1,000 production jobs and almost 1,500 in construction. It will make films there, as well as the next series of ""Stranger Things"". Last year Netflix opened a production hub at Britain's Shepperton Studios and earlier this year plans were approved to build a studio complex near Ashford in southern England that may house Netflix and Amazon."

For all Donald Trump's efforts to overturn this month's election, American democracy never looked likely to buckle after polling day. Sure enough, on November 23rd, even as the president once again condemned ""the most corrupt election in American history"", he agreed that the federal government should give Joe Biden the resources he needs to prepare for office.
Mr Trump has still done harm, as have the Republican leaders who indulged him (see Lexington). Given that four in every five Republican voters say the vote was ""stolen"", trust in the fairness of elections has been shaken and Mr Biden unjustly undermined from the very start. Henceforth in close votes routine jobs like counting and certifying votes will risk being part of the battleground. That is not a threat to the republic's existence, but it does mark a further partisan deterioration in American democracy.
It is also part of a global democratic recession. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a flourishing in the number and quality of liberal democracies, but the trend has now gone into reverse. Hungary and Poland are blocking the European Union budget because their governments refuse to bow to the rule of law (see Charlemagne). Our briefing describes how in the world's largest democracy the Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp) under Narendra Modi is capturing institutions, including the courts, the police and now, it is feared, the election commission. The Economist Intelligence Unit (eiu), our sister organisation, has been compiling a democracy index since 2006. Last year's score was the worst ever. Covid-19 has accelerated the decline.
The threat is not from military coups but governments in power. Given time, unscrupulous leaders can hollow out democracy completely. Two decades ago Venezuela held meaningful elections; today it is about to eliminate the last kernel of opposition (see Americas section). But even in countries where such a calamity is unthinkable, the erosion of norms and institutions leads to worse government. To reverse this, you have to understand what has gone wrong.
Whether you support them or not, Mr Trump and his fellow populists came to power as a response to the failings of democratic governments. In rich countries working-class voters came to believe that politicians did not care about them, after their living standards stagnated and they became worried about immigration. In central and eastern Europe governments seeking to join the eu paid more heed to Brussels than their own voters. In developing countries corruption sent the message that the ruling classes were chiefly interested in their own bank accounts.
Enterprising politicians responded to these feelings by elevating identity far above policy so as to show voters that their grievances matter. Such was the upheaval that some old parties were swept away-in France in 2017 they won just a quarter of the vote between them. Poland had thrived under a centrist government, but Law and Justice told voters that their Catholic values were under attack from Brussels. In Brazil Jair Bolsonaro endorsed voters' contempt for the political class (see Bello). So relentless is Mr Trump's focus on the identity of his base that he did not even propose a programme for his second term.
Identity politics, boosted by social media and partisan television and radio, has re-engaged voters. Participation is the only component of the eiu's democracy index to have improved since 2006. Mr Biden and Mr Trump both won more votes than any presidential candidates in history. But in solving one of democracy's problems, identity politics has created others.
That is because a politics that reinforces immutable identities leads away from the tolerance and forbearance a democracy needs to solve social conflicts. In arguments about who gets what, people can split the difference and feel content. In arguments about who they are-over religion, race and anti-elitism, say-compromise can seem like betrayal. When ways of life are at stake the other lot are not just mistaken, they are dangerous. Having not mattered enough, elections now matter too much.
In some countries majoritarian leaders have exploited this tribal loyalty to nobble the institutions supposed to check them. In Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan governs as if democratic power is absolute and condemns those who block him as enemies of the republic. In Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador sidesteps entire branches of government, which have supposedly been captured by the elites, and appeals directly to his supporters in referendums. In India, when the electoral commission pursued bjp candidates less scrupulously than their opponents, one of the three top commissioners objected-only to find his family investigated for tax evasion.
America's institutions are protected by the professionalism of its judges and officials. Many of them feel bound by standards laid down by those who came before them. When Mr Trump tried to subvert the election, he failed abjectly because countless people did their duty.
As a result, the main harm identity politics does to America comes through animosity and gridlock. Politics is supposed to resolve society's conflicts, but democracy is generating them instead. Partly because tribes live in different information universes, matters of fact like wearing masks and climate change are transformed into disputes about people's way of life. The result is that American politics has once again become unresponsive. It fires people up so much that it obstructs the compromises needed for society to move forward.
Vote for change
Some warn that the discontent this creates will cause democracies to die-an outcome that its foes, championed by Vladimir Putin, have schemed to bring about. And yet, there are plenty of reasons to hope. One of democracy's strengths is that it promises lots of chances to start again. So long as elections take place, there is always the possibility of kicking the rascals out even in places where governments stack the vote. In the cities of Hungary and Poland voters have begun to reject repression and cronyism. In eu elections last year populists did worse than expected. Perhaps the pendulum has already begun to swing. India is too vast and too diverse for a single party to rule on its own.
Democracy is adaptable, too. In America's election Republicans picked up Hispanic and black votes; and in Britain last year 1 the governing Conservative Party won Labour seats in the Midlands. That mixing is just what politics in both countries needs, because it encourages parties on the left and right to break out of their tribal redoubts and to tilt the balance of political effort away from identity and back towards outcomes.
Democracy is, for good or ill, also linked to the fortunes of the superpower that is most closely tied to it. America supports democracy partly through example and advocacy. At home Mr Biden will attempt to restore norms such as the independence of the Justice Department. Abroad, he will not indulge autocrats and tyrants as much as Mr Trump has. And America could boost democracy through power politics. If Mr Biden wants to create an alliance to help America keep ahead in the race against China for tech dominance, democracy will help define it.
Above all, democracy is something people strive for. Every weekend Belarusians risk their liberty and their lives by taking to the streets to defy the dictator who refuses them the right to choose who should govern them, just as Hong Kongers, Sudanese and Thais have. It is an inspiration that voters everywhere should carry with them to the ballot box. *"

Has the pandemic made incumbent firms stronger?
As the prospect of a widely distributed vaccine draws nearer-this week AstraZeneca and Oxford University announced results for their jab (see Science section)-bosses and investors are turning one eye away from the immediate struggle of coping with the pandemic and looking instead at the longerterm competitive picture. Who has won and who has lost? Like viruses, recessions usually come for the weakest first. Companies with sickly balance-sheets or frail margins quickly succumb. As promising startups become crushed closedowns, it is often the incumbents that have the resources to wait it out.
Yet the covid-19 recession has been sharper than normal, and more complicated. The world economy is expected to shrink by over 4% this year, the deepest downturn since the second world war, and there is still a risk of a double-dip recession (see leader). Bail-outs, central-bank stimulus and forbearance by banks and landlords have slowed the process of creative destruction and cut the number of defaults. Social distancing is laying waste to some industries while boosting others, as people find new ways to do old things.
As a result the normal pattern in which powerful firms gain more clout is less emphatic than you might expect-so far. Investors are struggling to get to grips with such an unusual outlook. This is partly why, although anticipated, the news on vaccines in the past few weeks has caused gyrations in financial markets as fund managers bet more heavily on firms they feared to touch just a few weeks ago.
What, then, is a good way to assess the winners and losers? In many businesses the incumbents will remain on top, because their entire industry has proved immune to online disruption. In other cases the incumbents will win-but because they have mastered new digital innovations. Finally, in some parts of the economy where technological change seems to have been speeded up, the running is being done by new entrants.
Live music is one industry that the pandemic has completely unplugged (see Business section). With concerts and festivals banned, Live Nation, the largest concert organiser, has seen its sales fall by 95% compared with a year ago. Yet with no way to replicate a mosh-pit online, the industry is not being disrupted so much as put in the deep freeze. As Live Nation's buoyant share price suggests, it can afford to wait until life returns to normal. Many other industries, such as air travel, cannot move online. This year will do grave damage to airlines' balance-sheets-their total debt has reached half a trillion dollars. (British Airways is literally selling off the family china to shore up its finances: half a dozen first-class teacups can be yours for just over $30.) But those that survive will find the skies less crowded.
Elsewhere there has been more digital disruption-but it is the incumbents that have benefited. Advertising has shifted even further online, where the duopoly of Facebook and Google rules. Likewise, much office-based work has moved to the home, leading to empty office buildings and abandoned photocopiers. The upshot of this disruption is that people are more reliant than ever on big tech firms that provide cloud services. Though the pandemic will cause permanent change to all such industries, the dominant names in each will be familiar.
Yet there is a third group of industries which have been disrupted in ways that threaten the incumbents. Live sport has more or less continued throughout the pandemic, as teams have found ways to test or quarantine players. But the absence of crowds has contributed to a plunge in tv viewership, the financial engine of the sports industry. Instead, people are tuning in more often to highlights clips, betting sites and other interactive ways of enjoying sport on social apps, threatening the cable-TV firms. In catering, a growing appetite for delivery services such as DoorDash, whose revenues this year have more than trebled, points to a future in which eating at home becomes more common. Food retailers and restaurants will have to adapt, or see their profits nibbled away.
And what is the picture for the economy as whole? If you look at America's stockmarket, the shares of the biggest companies by sales have outperformed this year-but only in 33 out of 59 industries, and by a median margin of just two percentage points. In many areas the battle for supremacy is still raging. Thus, in ecommerce Amazon's sales have surged but it faces revived competition in the form of Walmart's online operation and Shopify, a digital upstart. Covid-19 has brought with it economic damage on a vast scale. Yet the rapid changes that have been forced on many industries are leading to innovation that will outlive the pandemic-and in some cases are leaving incumbents less mighty than before. Consumers and trustbusters alike must hope that these newly competitive parts of the economy remain hotly contested long after the pandemic abates. *"

Africa and the world need to act now to stop the slaughter in Tigray
First, the police and militia shut the roads out of Mai Kadra, a farming town in Ethiopia's northern province of Tigray. Then they went from door to door, checking id cards and singling out non-Tigrayans. They destroyed sim cards to stop people phoning for help. Then, on November 9th, members of a Tigrayan youth group stabbed, hacked, burned and strangled hundreds of Amhara men, according to the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (ehrc). When federal government troops entered the town the next morning at least 600 people were dead, says the ehrc.
Because of an internet and telephone blackout, as well as restrictions on journalists and ngos, it is hard to be sure exactly what happened. But there is no doubt that a massacre occurred. Amnesty International has videos of bodies strewn across the town. And it seems likely that it was committed by forces allied to the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (tplf), the ruling party in Tigray. It is also beyond doubt that federal government forces or their allied ethnic militias have also committed atrocities in the same area. Tigrayans who have fled across the border to Sudan tell of attacks on civilians by Amhara militiamen and government soldiers. The government says undercover tplf agents are sowing disinformation.
Ethiopia's civil war is less than a month old, but its horrors are multiplying fast. Government forces surround Mekelle, Tigray's capital. On November 21st Ethiopia's army warned the city's 500,000 inhabitants that it would have ""no mercy"" and that they should ""save themselves"". A day later Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's prime minister, gave the tplf 72 hours to surrender. To treat an entire city and its people as a target would be a war crime. In a country as riven with ethnic tensions as Ethiopia, it could also lead to wider bloodletting. Tigrayan civilians elsewhere are already being singled out. Hundreds have been arrested in the capital, Addis Ababa. Tigrayans in the army have been disarmed or detained. Those in the civil service have been told not to come to work. Tigrayans trying to leave the country are turned back at the airport. ""This has the smell of Rwanda,"" says a foreign diplomat.
Both sides passed up opportunities to reduce tensions before the first shots were fired by the tplf on November 4th. Now each appears to think it has the upper hand. Abiy seems to be trying to topple the tplf before Joe Biden takes charge in America. The tplf's leaders, many of whom are graduates of its guerrilla war against a Marxist dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s, seem to think they can win concessions by fighting from the hills and dragging the war out. Both sides act as if they have more to gain from killing than talking.
Outsiders need to convince them otherwise. First, the un and African Union (au) should make it clear that those who commit war crimes will be held accountable. Independent investigators should be allowed in to determine what happened at Mai Kadra. Non-combatants must be spared. Humanitarian corridors should be opened to allow aid to flow.
If Ethiopia commits grave war crimes, the un and au should also impose an arms embargo. This would not stop the killing entirely-the region is awash with guns and machetes. But halting the flow of artillery shells and bombs would dampen it and send a clear signal to both parties.
Donors should rethink their support for Ethiopia, which relies on aid. Western powers are hesitating for fear of being accused of neocolonialism. The au is reluctant to act because of its policy of not interfering in its members' internal affairs. But if nothing is done, Ethiopia will slide deeper into crisis. It could even break apart, like Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Good neighbours should apply pressure now to prevent such a catastrophe. *"

Fights about stimulus are breaking out everywhere. Time for rules-based budgeting
Economic forecasters could be forgiven for feeling a sense of whiplash. As covid-19 runs rampant in Europe and America the world economy is taking another hit from the pandemic. America's consumers are gloomy; Europe's service sector is contracting. At the same time the growing prospect of mass vaccination in 2021raises the prospect of an imminent recovery. In 2020 economists were too pessimistic about how fast growth would rebound after the first wave of infection, especially in America. A vaccine might allow another snapback in 2021.
A springtime consensus that governments should spend big on rescue packages has given way to bickering and confusion. In America Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, is bringing to an end some of the Federal Reserve's emergency programmes (see Finance section). Janet Yellen, whom President-elect Joe Biden this week chose to be Mr Mnuchin's successor, will be greeted by a legal and political storm about the Fed's lending authority. Congress looks unlikely to agree to renew emergency spending on unemployment insurance and loans before Mr Biden takes office. In Europe Hungary and Poland are holding up the eu's budget and its €750bn ($900bn) ""recovery fund"" in a spat over whether the disbursement of cash should be conditional on countries upholding the rule of law. The European Commission has warned several countries about their debts. Britain's government is trying to reconcile an instinctive suspicion of deficits with a recognition that the economy still needs life support, in part by cutting the foreign-aid budget (see Britain section).
Clear thinking is needed. It should start with the recognition that public debts in rich countries, though soaring, are sustainable because of rock-bottom interest rates. Despite borrowing 19% of its gdp this year, Britain will save about £ubn ($17bn) on debt interest compared with last year. While rates are low, higher debt will not by itself demand belt-tightening after the crisis.
A different problem will arise if the pandemic scars economies, reducing tax revenue and increasing welfare spending for a long time. The result would be a persistent shortfall in the public finances. Yet the extent of the pandemic's lasting impact is highly uncertain owing to the novel nature of the crisis. The main driver of recent economic fluctuations has been government diktats about whether shops and restaurants can stay open, the impact of which baffles orthodox economic models. America's unemployment rate undershot the Fed's summer forecast by more than two percentage points within a matter of months. The scenarios presented by Britain's official forecasters this week ranged from there being no enduring damage to a longterm hit to gdp of 6% a year.
It is better to wait to see how large a hole the pandemic leaves in budgets than to risk slowing the recovery with premature austerity. Britain has chosen to wait. More countries should follow the example of Australia and pledge not to tighten fiscal policy actively until the economy has crossed a defined threshold-in its case an unemployment rate of 6%. Much as clear ""forward guidance"" by central banks helps monetary stimulus to work, fiscal rules would help boost confidence in the future.
Sadly, putting in place a new, formal, fiscal framework will be hard in America, with its divided and gridlocked political system. All the same, a pragmatic deal may be possible in the short run-Democrats should accept the smaller stimulus on offer from the Republicans, rather than hold out for the enormous spending they would prefer. With the unemployed burning through their savings and small firms facing a bleak winter, the speed of emergency support matters more than its size.
The consequences of any policy mistakes will be all the greater today because low interest rates mean that central banks cannot easily ride to the rescue. Governments can afford to wait a little longer before tightening the purse-strings. And waiting is the cautious and responsible choice. *"

Exams are grim, but most alternatives are worse
Around the world covid-19 has messed up children's education. They began to be shut out of classrooms all the way back in February. Even in countries where schools have stayed open, lessons and tests have been disrupted. Some countries pressed ahead with national exams (see International section) this year. A few others, including Britain, France and Ireland, cancelled them all. They came up with new ways of awarding grades instead. The fact that big exams have proved so vulnerable to disruption has led to new questions about their usefulness. Are there better ways of measuring what children have learned?
Exams have plenty of problems. They are often unreliable; a study in Israel found that test-takers' performance can be affected by smog. Many children find them stressful. Plenty of places run them badly. School-leavers in China are often set questions that require them to parrot propaganda. Poorly written test papers in developing countries lead to wild swings in pass rates. Countries, including Algeria and Ethiopia, have resorted to shutting down the internet at exam time to prevent cheating.
Yet most of the world's best-performing school systems retain some kind of high-stakes tests, and for good reason. Other kinds of assessments are rarely better and many are worse. If teachers are responsible for appraising their pupils' work, they may reinforce their own biases. Studies have caught them giving lower grades to students from ethnic minorities or those who are fat. Grades in American high schools are inflating fast, in part because pushy middle-class parents insist their little darlings deserve better. A glut of top marks makes it even harder for clever pupils from poor homes to stand out. Forgoing exams does not always alleviate pupils' anxiety. Some would rather be tested at the end of their course than have their work constantly assessed. Coursework can waste students' efforts by encouraging them to tweak a few projects endlessly. That leaves less time for other kinds of learning.
The pandemic should not alter these judgments much. It is true that officials in England, where important exams were cancelled, would have found it easier to calculate which grades to hand out if their system had allowed pupils to acquire some marks in advance of their final tests. But other places managed to plough ahead with exams. Countries as diverse in their success against covid-19 as China, Germany and Spain all held some kind of examination this year, even if they changed the format.
In many countries the prospect-and pressure-of exams probably helped get pupils back into classrooms after initial lockdowns came to an end. Those facing important tests were generally invited back to school first. Their return helped give teachers and parents confidence that other pupils could safely join them. Kenya ended up letting exam-takers return to school in October, even though it had previously announced that it was cancelling all classes until the end of 2020.
Some countries that called off exams this year are still deciding whether and how to hold them in 2021. Many pupils are still making do with remote learning. Wales says it will not hold any of the tests usually sat by 16- and 18-year-olds next year because disparities in the amount of face-to-face teaching pupils are receiving would make formal exams unfair.
Governments may need to tweak next year's tests, as many did this year. That could mean cutting the amount of material to be tested. Exam boards may also have to boost the grades of pupils who have spent the most time out of the classroom. But the most important exams should go ahead in some form. Many pupils have studied ferociously throughout this difficult year. They should have the chance to earn the grades they deserve. *"

Outside the eu, Britain can farm greener and better
Many of the claims made by Brexiteers have turned out to be rubbish. Contrary to their assurances, Britain will not soon be signing a trade deal with America. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which the Brexiteers said would not be a problem, turns out to be a big one. Britain will probably end up letting French and Spanish trawlers into its waters. But one of the Brexiteers' boasts is entirely right: Britain really ought to be able to come up with better agricultural policies outside the eu.
It can hardly do worse. The common agricultural policy (cap), which Britain leaves on January 1st after 47 years, has been a lousy deal for the country. At considerable cost to the taxpayer, it has subsidised intensive farming methods that have denuded the countryside (see Britain section), causing more ecological damage than climate change. Since 1970 the population of nesting farmland birds has been cut in half. Tariffs have raised the price of food. Some farmers have benefited from subsidies. But others have not, because the subsidies are capitalised into land values, raising the cost of getting into farming.
Soon after the Brexit vote in 2016, ministers talked bravely about doing away with farming subsidies and paying for public goods. Yet England has moved as slowly as a ruminating cow. With just five weeks left in the cap, and some subsidy cuts beginning soon after, it has provided few details about what will replace them. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are even tardier. They will stick with the old subsidy system for the next few years.
For almost half a century Britain has barely had to think about creating policies for 70% of its land area. Now, amid a pandemic and Brexit, it is confronted with fundamental questions. Should the country subsidise farming? How should it help the environment? What should it do about food imports? All these questions are made trickier by the deeply peculiar way in which Britons think about the land.
There are good arguments for abolishing all public support and leaving farming to the market. The original rationale for farm payments-to boost domestic food production-has not made sense for decades. Countries like Britain are secure because they are wealthy and because international supply chains work, not because they grow lots of food. And subsidies are a crutch for indifferent farmers. After New Zealand did away with its subsidies in the 1980s, some farms went bust. Fewer than had been feared, though-and the survivors became technologically sophisticated and export-oriented.
Britain is not quite like New Zealand, for reasons that go to the heart of Britons' odd relationship with the countryside. In New Zealand, and also in America, people distinguish between farming and nature. Farmland is something that you might travel through in order to get somewhere pretty. Britons expect their agricultural land to be beautiful. Even national parks like Dartmoor and the Lake District are mostly farmed. English nature poetry is stuffed with shepherds, wheatfields and skylarks, John Clare's ""sweet minstrel of the farm and plough. Rambling along farmland footpaths is important to many Britons, and has been especially so during the pandemic. When other entertainments were cancelled, those who could grabbed their boots and headed for the fields with the dog.
British farmers are expected to produce not only skylarks and hawthorn, but increasingly to help with flood management and soaking up carbon dioxide, too. So it makes sense to pay them something. Today they get £2.5bn ($3.3bn) a year simply for farming, and can apply for another £5oom for worthy things like planting hedgerows. One sum is too large, the other too small. If farming subsidies were cut, along with the tax breaks on capital gains, inheritance and fuel (outrageously, farmers pay very little duty on the ""red diesel they use) there would be money to spare.
There is already a system, albeit a stingy, bureaucratic one, for paying farmers to take corners of their land out of production. Leave 16 square metres of a field fallow, so a skylark could nest in it, and you get £9. That is fine, but the taxpayer should also pay for wholesale changes, such as ""rewilding or small fields, which research shows are more biodiverse than large ones. They are also more interesting for walkers, as anyone who has tramped across the breadbasket of eastern England can attest.
Civil servants are now working on a new English schedule of payments for green activities, which are supposed to be introduced in 2024. That is the wrong approach, in a couple of ways. Because different parts of the country would benefit from different things (more hedgerows in East Anglia, better stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales) local authorities, not central government, should set the priorities and distribute some of the money. It would be better still if reverse auctions were used. At the moment, officials must guess the price that will induce enough farmers to plant hedges or set aside land for butterflies. America's Department of Agriculture asks them to bid, then takes the best offers. That reveals the true cost.
Britain must also deal with the vexed issue of food imports. Farmers' organisations argue that the country should not import foods that are harder on the environment or on animals than would be allowed under domestic rules. An impressive coalition, ranging from celebrity chefs to shepherds, backs the campaign, which raises the spectres of American chlorinewashed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Most Britons agree.
The grass below-above the vaulted sky
The government is refusing to be so bound-a deeply unpopular decision that is nonetheless correct. In practice, it will remain tied to eu food standards because of the overriding importance of trade with the bloc. It should not restrict its freedom any more than that. To insist that imports meet domestic standards ignores the fact that other countries have different climates and pests, so need different tools. East African countries have spent the past year fighting locust swarms with some insecticides that are banned in Britain-but then, Britain has no locusts. If Britons care about farming methods in other countries, let them show it by their purchases, as they have shown that they prefer freerange eggs. The government, meanwhile, should start repairing half a century's-worth of damage to the countryside. *"

Although there was a carrot for people who got tested for covid-19 in Slovakia's masstesting programme, there was a strong stick, too (""Scouse lessons"", November 21st). The carrot for those who got tested and proved negative was access to freedoms and exemptions from an otherwise strict curfew. But employees who did not take part in the nationwide test had to self-isolate, in effect, and could not go to work. If they weren't able to provide any other certificate of a negative test to their employer they had to stay at home and take annual or unpaid leave. However, if they took part and tested positive they could claim sick leave, but still had to self-isolate with their whole household.
This carrot-and-stick approach led to a 95% turnout for the nationwide test, helping Slovakia halve its covid-19 prevalence in just a week.

Veering to the left
I strongly disagree that Germany's Christian Democratic Union is a ""centre-right"" party (""The long farewell"", October 31st). This might have been true in the early years of the Merkel era. Nowadays, however, both the cdu and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria have lost any kind of sustainable trait of conservatism.
The euro has been turned into a political football, immigration laws and regulations are a mess, defence, national security and other areas that are of importance to conservatives are in disarray. nato and the wider European alliance are in bits. Even worse, a radicalised party, which evolved from a liberal-minded down-to-earth opposition to Angela Merkel, has managed to establish itself permanently across the country.
The conservative parties have turned into rather leftish marketing professionals. Their primary goal is to conserve power and to celebrate ""ethical"" views, instead of bringing the country and Europe forward. Sadly, Richard von Weizsäcker's assessment of Helmut Kohl's turn to a self-centred policy focus was made substantial throughout the Merkel years.
It is time for Mrs Merkel to step down now. New and bold leadership is needed to provide answers and solutions to how Germany will earn its living in the near future and how it will play a geostrategic role. A lot is at stake.

Women and the vote
Banyan gave New Zealand the honour of being the ""the first place in the world to give women the vote"" (November 7th). That was in 1893. In 1869 the American territory of Wyoming gave women the vote, as did the territory of Utah in 1870, if only for a few years.
In what is now Canada some women voted as early as 1793, not because British common law said they could, but because it didn't say they could not. Canadian legislatures closed that loophole but in 1873 female property owners in British Columbia got the right to vote in municipal elections.

Talk all you want
Much of the discussion regarding social media and free speech does not distinguish between the freedom of speech and the right to be heard (""The great clean-up"", October 24th). Freedom of speech is protected, but the right to be heard is not. Speakers were never guaranteed a platform for their views until social media came along. Now everyone has a chance to be heard.
But denying access to antivaxxers, say, would in no way limit their right to free speech. They would still have all the freedom of speech they enjoyed before Facebook was created. They can talk to their neighbours, write letters, call people on the telephone, publish pamphlets, organise petitions and even start their own social-media platforms.

Singapore's food hawkers
Food-hawker centres are Singapore's community dining rooms and offer affordable diverse food (""Out with the new"", October 31st). Indeed, Singaporeans have such passion for the food that we have nominated hawker culture to be included as a unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage. unesco's evaluation body has recently recommended the inscription.
Our hawker centres were first built in the 1970s, providing street hawkers with more hygienic settings. We ceased building new centres in 1985 and resumed in 2012. This partly explains the low rents of older-generation hawkers and the high median age of those working in the centres. The government began offering training programmes in 2013 to attract new hawkers to the trade, along with significantly subsidised fees and stall rentals. The operators of new hawker centres also run programmes to support new entrants. The results have been promising.
The median age of new hawkers since 2013 is 46, much lower than the national median. Many young enterprising hawkers have gone beyond selling traditional fare to offer Western and other fusion foods. We expect the median age to decrease further.
These efforts will sustain the trade, and keep Singapore's hawker culture flourishing for future generations.

A power-hungry prime minister threatens to turn India into a one-party state
In early november justices at India's Supreme Court turned their attention to an urgent plea. Arnab Goswami, a prominent journalist, had been dragged from his home and hurled into jail. Government ministers decried the arrest as an assault on free speech, demanding that Mr Goswami be granted bail. The hearing was brief. ""If we as a constitutional court do not lay down law and protect liberty, then who will? proclaimed one judge. That evening Mr Goswami swept out of Mumbai's Taloja prison into a rapturous crowd. ""This is a victory for the people of India! he crowed.
But was it? To much of India's commentariat, Mr Goswami's case represented not a test of freedom so much as a test of power. On its current trajectory, by all evidence (as the chart on the next page illustrates), the world's largest democracy is headed to a future that is less, not more free.
Mr Goswami is a controversial figure. He has pioneered a style of attack journalism that makes his nightly television programme look like a show trial from China's Cultural Revolution. Its victims are often critics of government policy. They are typically reduced to a corner box as Mr Goswami swells into a finger-jabbing prosecutor, denouncing them as ""antinational or, worse, an agent of Pakistan.
What landed Mr Goswami in jail was not something he said, though his tirades against the Mumbai police have indeed enraged the local government, which happens to be opposed to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (bjp). The journalist's alleged crime involved a big unpaid debt to a decorator, who had left a suicide note blaming him, among others, for his fatal distress. ""Abetment to suicide remains an offence in India. The case had been closed in 2019, when the bjp still wielded power in Mumbai, and its reopening smacked of
a vendetta. So the court's ruling was not surprising. What shocked was the speed of its intervention. Mr Goswami spent just a week in detention, and his case had hardly reached the lowest rung of courts, yet the country's topmost judges ignored the court's backlog of some 60,000 cases to schedule a bail hearing within a day of the anchor's appeal. This is in a country where prisons hold twice as many inmates awaiting trial, some 330,000 people, as they
do convicts. A majority of these ""undertrials come from minority groups and a quarter have spent more than a year behind bars, reckons Leah Verghese, a law researcher. When Mr Modi clamped direct rule on the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year, thousands of its residents were detained. Out of more than 550 writs of habeas corpus such as Mr Goswami's that Kashmiris filed, courts have disdained to look at all but
a handful. In the same week that Mr Goswami won his swift reprieve, Father Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old Jesuit priest who has championed rights for tribal peoples and is being held as an alleged Maoist terrorist, made a plea before a lower court. As he suffers from Parkinson's disease and cannot hold a cup steady, lawyers requested that he be allowed to have a straw in his prison cell. The court postponed the hearing for
20 days. Even more striking is the courts' footdragging over constitutional questions. In 2017 Mr Modi slipped through parliament a controversial law that created ""electoral bonds, asserting that as a budgetary matter it need not be scrutinised by the upper house, which was not then in bjp control. The Supreme Court still ? the constitutionality of this innovation, which allows unlimited, anonymous donations to political parties. Other big questions its judges have yet to take up include the imposition last year of direct rule on Kashmir and some 140 legal petitions against the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019, which by inserting religion as a criterion for citizenship undermines the secular nature of the Indian state.
Sleepwalking into authoritarianism?
Slow, uneven and arbitrary justice are not new to India. Yet its courts have often tried to check executive power. It was a judge's ruling that Indira Gandhi, perhaps India's most powerful prime minister, had cheated in an election that prompted her in 1975 to plunge India into a 21-month Emergency, during which she threw opponents in jail and ruled by decree. Legal professionals now liken the current moment to that darkest period for Indian democracy. ""This government has done so much damage to personal liberty,"" says Ajit Prakash Shah, a former high-court judge. ""But the courts, especially the Supreme Court, have watched this indiscriminate and violent trampling of dissent like mute spectators.""
It is not only the courts, alas, that seem eager to stay in step with the government. Many cogs in India's institutional machinery are not merely complacent, but have grown complicit in a project that threatens to turn the country into a one-party state. At least during the Emergency the threat was clear, says Tarunabh Khaitan, vicedean of law at Oxford University and author of a paper, ""Killing a Constitution with a Thousand Cuts"", that details India's institutional decay. ""What we have now is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" he says. ""There is no full-frontal big-ticket attack on democracy, but there are multiple, simultaneous attacks on all fronts...We are sleepwalking into authoritarianism.""
Of the ostensibly independent institutions that are now compliant, India's police stand out. Despite individually humane and honest officers, the impression Indians hold of the force is that its main purpose is to protect the powerful and persecute the weak. A case in point is the Delhi police's management of communal riots that racked parts of India's capital for three days last winter, leaving 53 dead.
Top officers in the force, which before Mr Modi's government stopped releasing statistics comprised just 2% Muslims in a city with a 13% Muslim minority, had been filmed standing next to a bjp politician at a rally where he threatened to attack protesters, mostly Muslims, holding a peaceful sit-in against the new citizenship law. During the violence, police were filmed throwing rocks and torturing captured Muslim youths. More than two-thirds of those beaten, shot and hacked to death were Muslim. Yet Delhi's finest have declined to register complaints against bjp members for incitement. Their investigations have focused on a purported Islamist-Marxist conspiracy to foment unrest in order to embarrass Mr Modi at a time when he was hosting President Donald Trump.
An amendment made last year to the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (uapa), a draconian law from 1967 that allows the state to label and then ban groups as terrorist, now empowers the government to designate any individual as a terrorist. The state may hold suspects indefinitely with no right of bail, confiscate their property and implicate any associate as an accessory to terrorism. During India's harsh lockdown to combat covid-19 last spring, police in Delhi quietly rounded up scores of youths alleged to have been involved in the riots, and charged many under the uapa.
Having enjoyed a stranglehold on the Lok Sabha, parliament's lower house, for six years, and more recently acquired control of the upper Rajya Sabha, Mr Modi's government has passed a slew of other laws not only to expand its powers, but to dilute those of potential challengers. One thorn in its side has been a law from 2005 that upholds citizens' right to obtain information (rti) from state officials. Seen as a big advance for transparency in a country where mandarins remained aloof and unchallenged, the law created an independent commission to ensure that requests from the public receive a response. The number of requests runs at over 1m a year.
In 2019 the government amended the rti law. It reduced the tenure and prestige of the role of the commission's chief. Small wonder that the commission is rejecting a growing number of information requests from the public, citing ""insufficient documentation"", even as the number of pending requests has swollen by 50%. Having frequently neglected to fill empty seats on the 11-person commission, the government in October tapped a journalist whose chief works are two books that glowingly laud the ""Modi model"" of government.
Such appointments are a prerogative of the executive, one that previous leaders have scarcely been shy of exercising. More unusual under Mr Modi has been his almost axiomatic choice of candidates with Hindu-nationalist credentials, often from his home state of Gujarat, and his insistence on inserting loyalists even into institutions that had been seen as sanctuaries from party politics. Twice Mr Modi has replaced heads of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's respected central bank, after they expressed less than fulsome praise of his economic policies. As India's latest comptroller and auditor-general (cag), Mr Modi reportedly passed over seven senior secretaries from within the organisation and instead parachuted in a retired official from Gujarat. The cag has a record of honest and incisive reporting, but has raised hackles by exposing government waste.
Modi operandi
In 2016 Mr Modi similarly ignored institutional precedent in the Indian army, lifting General Bipin Rawat over the heads of two senior officers to appoint him its top commander. Last year, following a change of rules that stretched the retirement age, General Rawat was promoted to chief of staff of India's combined forces. The army maintains a tradition of keeping a distance from politics that makes it almost unique in its region, but observers have detected a growing tendency for officers to weigh in publicly on civilian matters, and retired soldiers whisper reproach against officers for ""cosying up"" to politicians.
Mr Modi has made a spectacle of his own commander-in-chief role as no other recent prime minister, and also minted electoral gold from pre-election military operations. Helpfully, India's soldiers have remained silent at useful moments, too. As independent satellite evidence emerged this summer showing that Chinese forces had occupied strategic posts in territory claimed by India along remote sections of the countries' border, the army steadfastly refused to comment on Indian government assertions that no land had been lost.
Even the impartiality of the Election Commission of India (eci), with a sterling seven-decade record of managing the mammoth logistics of Indian votes, has come under scrutiny. During the 2019 general election, which Mr Modi won by a landslide, his opponents sharply protested when the prime minister and other top bjp leaders repeatedly escaped serious censure for issuing what amounted to communal dog whistles, whereas the eci promptly sanctioned rival candidates for lesser infractions of its strict codes of conduct. One of the body's three top commissioners did object, but was overruled. His family subsequently found itself being investigated for alleged tax evasion. The official quit the eci before the end of his term.
Given that India continues to run elections that by most standards are admirably free and fair, it may seem churlish to voice fears for its democracy. After all, even as America's presidential count was mired in controversy in early November, election officials in Bihar-India's poorest state, with a population of 125m-managed to count the votes without a hitch in less than a day. Like so many others in recent years, that election was won fair and square by Mr Modi's team, in Bihar's case in alliance with a local party.
The bjp's supporters scoff at the notion that its rise under Mr Modi has entailed any subversion of institutions or dilution of democracy. Such protests are merely sour grapes, insists Raghavan Jagannathan, editor of Swarajya, a right-wing magazine. ""Our democracy is flawed, but it is a work in progress, not just about the people who are currently in power."" Modi apologists point to disturbing trends in states that are not ruled by the bjp. Kerala recently introduced a law to punish ""offensive"" speech by up to three years in prison (but withdrew it after heavy criticism). In Odisha, a family with connections to the bjp that owns a television channel critical of the local ruling party has found itself buried in lawsuits.
Indian politics is a game of hardball. The bjp is the world's largest political machine, with many multiples the energy, organisational strength and financial backing of its rivals. It has a strong leader in Mr Modi, and a strong narrative, however unpalatable it is to many. This contrasts sharply with the vacillation of Congress, India's previous dominant party. Led by a fading Gandhi dynasty, it has slowly disintegrated. Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of 23 Congress leaders who recently petitioned Sonia Gandhi, the party president, for sweeping changes, says its leadership has lost connection with people on the ground. Its organisational structure has ""collapsed"". Indians who loathe Mr Modi are often just as disparaging of Rahul Gandhi, the party's mediocre current figurehead.
Grand designs in Delhi
In the absence of a strong opposition at the centre, the most effective resistance to the bjp's dominance lies in state capitals, as well in the press and more broadly in civil society. These bastions are all under heavy assault. Mr Modi's fearsome chief lieutenant, Amit Shah, the home minister, has made no secret of his determination to topple Mamata Banerjee, a staunch and often vitriolic critic who has run the pivotal state of West Bengal since 2011, in state elections next year. Opposition parties holding slim majorities in other big states, including Rajasthan and Maharashtra, are acutely aware of the bjp's capacity to ""persuade"" defectors to its side. This recently happened in Madhya Pradesh, where Mr Modi's party unceremoniously unseated Congress after luring away a chunk of its deputies.
By leaning on the big conglomerates that dominate the mainstream media, by favouring outlets that share its ideology, such as Mr Goswami's, and by flooding social media with agitprop, the bjp has largely marginalised critical voices in the press. In the past two months, new rules have curtailed the permitted level of foreign investment in online media and placed the entire sector under the authority of the broadcasting ministry. The moves appear to be aimed at getting a grip on one of the main remaining outlets for dissent, say editors at three of India's increasingly popular news sites. One that specialised in hardhitting investigative stories, HuffPost India, closed on November 24th.
Compliance regulations regarding foreign donations have already been used to shut down tens of thousands of ngos. The most recent example is the local chapter of Amnesty International, an advocacy group for human rights. In September the government added onerous filing requirements and rules that forbid larger charities from funding smaller ones.
Mr Khaitan, the Oxford law professor, is not alone in warning that the bjp's one-sided advantage is subtly changing the nature of India's game. ""We do not have a level playing field any more,"" he says. ""What we are getting is not quite a one-party state, but certainly a hegemonic state."" The trajectory resembles that in other democracies, such as Hungary, Poland and Turkey, where autocracy is on the rise (see chart).
Mr Modi is now taking a keen interest in reshaping Delhi, India's capital, in more imperial fashion. Following an opaque and hasty process that to no surprise ended with the choice of Mr Modi's own favourite architect, a fellow Gujarati, as chief designer, the city's Central Vista, a 3km-long avenue of lawns not unlike the National Mall in Washington, is going under the knife. It will be flanked by ten giant, identical government office buildings. The project foresees the building of a new, expanded parliament, big enough to seat double the 545 mps that currently sit in the lower house. The old building will become a ""Museum of Democracy"". And, naturally, there will be a bigger, fancier residence and office for the prime minister himself.
Another sign of Mr Modi's direction of travel can be detected in the differing ""read-outs"" after his congratulatory phone call to President-elect Joe Biden. Among the things that Mr Biden's team said the two had discussed was a shared commitment to ""strengthening democracy, at home and abroad"". In the version from Mr Modi's office, that bit was left out. *"

Britain has a massive pothole problem. Help is at hand
Last december, councillors Bob Smytherman and Martin McCabe threw a birthday party-not for a friend, a relation or a celebrity, but for a pothole. Cars in Worthing, West Sussex, had been bumping over it for a full two years, despite pleas that it be mended. The stunt worked. The following day it was filled in, and a second party-a lavish affair, with cake and candles-marked its demise. But plenty of its fellows survive. Mr Smytherman says the town has so many craters, it's like ""walking on the moon"".
Potholes arouse passions in Britainnot surprisingly, since the country's road quality ranks 37th in the world, between Slovenia and Lithuania. Councils received 700,000 complaints about potholes last year, says the Federation of Small Businesses. The weather, a topic even more popular among the natives than potholes, is mostly to blame. Potholes form when water seeps under the road surface, breaking the tarmac as it expands and contracts. Budget cuts in the wake of the financial crisis did not help. The Local Government Association (lga) says road maintenance budgets fell from £1.1bn in 2009 to £701m in 2017- the equivalent of 8m potholes. The Asphalt Industry Alliance claims there is a road-repair backlog of £11bn.
But there may be relief in sight for the suspension of the British motor car. Politics is one reason. Traditional Tories-who love cars, particularly fast ones, and tend to live in the countryside, so rely on roads- are particularly infuriated by them. Northern ""red wall"" seats that the Tories won from Labour in the last election tend to be rural places where the roads are bumpier and the weather worse. Nottinghamshire, home to several of those contested seats, is Britain's pothole capital, with 253,920 reported in 2017-19. Hence the promise in the Tory manifesto of the ""biggest-ever pothole-filling programme"", and a promise of £2.5bn over five years.
Covid is also fuelling the drive against 1 potholes. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, needs shovel-ready spending opportunities to justify his claim in the spending review on November 25th that ""we're prioritising jobs"". Potholes are ready and waiting for those shovels-hence his commitment that £i.7bn would be spent this year.
Innovation should help get the job done. Rubberised asphalt is spreading across the nation's roads. Adding shredded tyres to the bitumen used to make asphalt creates an elasticity that helps it mould into the existing road and stops it breaking down as easily. Tarmac, a materials company, is supplying it to several councils. Sheffield council is trying out a simpler version, designed by another company, Roadmender Asphalt. Cumbria is experimenting with recycled plastic as a bitumen substitute, and in Oxfordshire and Kent ""Gipave"", a material made from adding a graphene-based additive to asphalt, is being used to resurface entire roads. It is 15-20% more expensive than asphalt but has twice the lifespan.
Repair design may help, too. Potholes are normally repaired by cutting squares out of the asphalt around them, but corners encourage water ingress, so Roadmole, a small road-repairing firm, produces a remotely controlled machine that cuts circular holes instead. The firm claims that none of the potholes they have fixed in the past eight years has needed to be redone.
In order to innovate, councils need cash. David Renard, the lga's transport spokesman, says the government's bung will help fix the backlog. But the supply of candidates for repair never dries up. Back in Worthing, Mr Smytherman says that his celebrated pothole is beginning to reappear. Another party looms. *"

""The last time you went into an nhs appointment...the floor would have been a certain type of splash-proof vinyl in case you bled all over it or threw up,"" says one. It is the sort of floor a mass vaccination centre requires.
The search for suitable venues has just become more urgent. On November 23rd the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine team announced positive results (though there are some concerns about the data-see Science section). A cheap, transportable vaccine would be good news for the world. It would also be good news for Britain, and not just because it would be the product of a British university and an Anglo-Swedish firm.
The government has ordered 40m doses of vaccine from Pfizer and 5m from Moderna, the two other firms to have announced phase-three-trial results. Both require two doses per person. It has ordered 100m from AstraZeneca, which may need just one-and-a-half. If all are approved, the AstraZeneca vaccine would thus accelerate the country's journey to herd immunity.
That approval is in the hands of Britain's medicines regulator, the mhra, which is reviewing data from all three firms. AstraZeneca had planned to have 30m doses ready by September; it missed that target, but is expected to have tens of millions ready when approval is granted. One insider says the hope is to deliver 5 m jabs a week by mid-January.
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the government, has drawn up a prioritisation list, with care-home residents and workers at the top, followed by the over-80s and health-care workers. The mhra will probably at first offer an emergency-use authorisation, which may restrict vaccination to the most at-risk until more evidence is in.
The British state's lacklustre response to the covid-19 pandemic provides plenty of reason for trepidation about the roll-out. But unlike the testing programme or trackand-trace, the National Health Service will be running things, removing the need to set up a leadership structure and local organisation from scratch.
It is not an entirely new exercise for the health service. Britain dishes out nearly 15m flu jabs a year. The need to store the Pfizer vaccine at -70°C limits the role of general practitioners (gps) who deliver much of the flu campaign, since few surgeries have sufficiently icy freezers. But the AstraZeneca vaccine can be kept at 8°C.
Around half of the vaccines will be delivered in the community, the other half in mass vaccination centres. They will spring up in places like hospitals, sports halls and universities. Paramedics, physiotherapists and student medics will be called upon to staff them. So, too, may vets, dentists and trained volunteers, for whom the government has tweaked human medicines regulation to allow them to administer jabs.
All of this is a big ask for the nhs at a time of year when it is normally most stretched. This year's expanded flu vaccine campaign suffered from distribution problems. gps are in discussions with nhs leadership about what parts of their job can be put on hold to allow them to focus on vaccination. ""We would want to protect patient-facing services,"" says Steve Mowle of the Royal College of General Practitioners.
Perhaps the biggest challenge will be the it system. It will need to contact people at the right time for their first and second jabs, and to integrate information with medical records. This is important, says Penny Ward of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a professional body, so that analysts can trawl the records for unidentified side effects. Not all are optimistic. A scientist advising the government says he cannot think of anything since the start of the pandemic ""where we relied on digital support and it happened in a timely way"".
In a programme of this scale, things will almost certainly go wrong. But if enough goes right, there is a glittering prize on offer. By spring, vaccination and increased testing ""should reduce the need for economic and social restrictions"", in the words of Boris Johnson. ""We should be able to render obsolete the very notion of a covid-19 lockdown."" *"

ST NEOTS
A bold attempt to make farming greener runs into two problems: politics and sheep
The field is in Hertfordshire, but it could be almost anywhere in lowland England. It is 600m wide and twice as long. On its northern edge is a frail, gappy hedgerow that would not stop a car, let alone a cow. Wheat and broad beans grew in the loamy soil during the summer, but the field is now almost bare, with scarcely a weed visible. Although you can see for miles, there is little to see-just a few crows and seagulls over a brown desert.
Under the eu's Common Agricultural Policy (cap), the farmer of this field is entitled to an annual subsidy of £233 ($311) per hectare. The farm automatically receives as much support as a small sheep farm in an inhospitable hilly region or a beautiful Cotswold farm laced with footpaths. Almost nobody is prepared to argue openly that Britain ought to continue subsidising such environmental degradation. But, with the country due to leave the cap on January 1st, it still lacks a detailed plan to replace it. And those who support the status quo are finding their voice.
Decades of farm subsidies since the second world war have achieved precisely what their creators wanted: a huge increase in food production. The number of pigs and sheep in Britain more than doubled between 1950 and 2000 (since when they have fallen slightly) as did the land area devoted to wheat. Farmers have become far more productive, thanks to advances in plant and animal breeding and better machines, fertilisers, insecticides and herbicides. Fields have grown, partly because, from the 1950s, farmers were given grants to demolish hedgerows. ""Farmers are often blamed. But they do what the government tells them to do,"" says Ian Gould of Oakbank, a company that sells seeds and advice.
The cap has boosted land values, particularly following the switch from production subsidies to per-hectare payments in the early 2000s. According to Savills, an estate agent, the average price of farmland has risen from below £4,500 per hectare to about £16,500 since 2003-a better return than home-owners have seen. Some buyers are enticed by the fact that farms are partly exempt from inheritance tax.
Subsidies also prop up unproductive farms, of which there are many. The average English farm made a profit on its purely agricultural activities of just £6,200 in the 2018-19 fiscal year, before farmers' unpaid labour was accounted for. Thanks to subsidies, and sidelines such as solar power production and renting buildings, they stagger on anyway. Subsidies ""have enabled farmers to stay where they are and not be innovative"", says Helen Radmore, a tenant farmer in Devon. Sales-forced or otherwise-are rare. Last year 47,000 hectares were publicly marketed for sale in Britain, according to Savills. That is just 0.3% of the total agricultural area.
Although the cap has been good for many farmers, the environment has suffered. Large, unbroken fields are inhospitable to many kinds of wildlife. The zealous eradication of weeds and the move from spring to autumn planting of wheat means little food is available for scavengers in winter. In 2016 a group of researchers from conservation groups estimated that agricultural intensification was the biggest driver of biodiversity loss in Britain since 1970. Urbanisation, invasive species and climate change (to which farming contributes) were all much less harmful.
Every year the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for Ornithology ask volunteers to count birds. Those binocular-toting folk report that the population of breeding farmland birds- creatures like corn buntings, goldfinches, lapwings, linnets and skylarks-has fallen to 40% of the 1975 level. Farmland birds have disappeared more quickly than woodland or water birds (see chart on next page).
Farms need not be ecological deserts. Consider Samuel Topham's 1,000-hectare farm in Cambridgeshire, east of St Neots. Like other cereal farmers, he grows crops on huge fields created by his grandfather, a keen remover of hedges. But in the field corners Mr Topham has planted blocks of wild flowers and plants that birds feast on, such as millet. He has set aside plots for lapwings and skylarks to nest, and has restored ponds. Red kites hover over his farm. Pheasants and partridges peck at the ground; they are for shooting.
Mr Topham does this because it pays- just about. Reversing a combine into a tight field corner takes time, increasing the fee that a contractor would charge for harvesting a crop, and compacts the soil. One fivehectare field is not worth ploughing at all; other areas are wet and unproductive. Since the government is prepared to pay him for growing flowers and bird food on those patches, he might as well do it. In all, one-tenth of his farm is dedicated to nature. ""I farm the environment,"" he says. The idea that farming is simply for producing food he calls ""old-fashioned"".
About one-eighth of direct support for farming in Britain, some £450m a year, goes on environmental schemes like these. They are complicated and bureaucratic (asked about them, Mr Topham pulls out a thick binder filled with precise instructions about how he should manage his land) and two-thirds of farmers do not bother. But the government promises a simpler, more generous regime. The Agriculture Act that received royal assent on November 11th will allow the agriculture department to phase out per-hectare payments over the next seven years, and spend more on public goods such as nature. It has pledged to keep the overall level of support constant during this parliament, which will end in 2024.
If the government can pull this off, it will profoundly change farming in England (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, which together have 48% of the United Kingdom's agricultural land, are moving more slowly in a similar direction). Farmland prices will probably fall, as will rents for tenant farmers, who farm onethird of the land in England. Some who were surviving on subsidies will be driven out of farming-the agriculture bill allows the government to support such people for a few years by means of ""de-linked"" payments. Biodiversity ought to recover. But two things stand in the way of change: politics and sheep.
Ever since an agriculture bill was published in 2017, farmers' organisations have protested that the government is emphasising greenery more than growing. They have persuaded some mps. ""Surely the primary public good-the most essential good there is-is food itself,"" said Danny Kruger, a Conservative, during a debate earlier this year. The National Farmers Union argues that the coronavirus pandemic shows how important it is for a country to produce its own food. Britain currently grows about two-thirds of what it consumes; that share should not be allowed to fall much further, the nfu says.
Such arguments ""are really specious"", says Ian Bateman, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Exeter. Food is a private good, not a public good. Britain's food security is guaranteed by its wealth and by robust supply chains, which have held up remarkably well during the pandemic. The agriculture bill was nonetheless amended during its passage through Parliament. The government must now ""have regard to the need to encourage the production of food by farmers in England"" and must report every five years on food security. Both changes seem innocuous. But they could be used as a wedge that will allow farmers to obtain more support for business as usual.
The nfu has also tried to persuade the government to ban imports of food that do not meet British animal-welfare or environmental standards. American chlorinewashed chicken and hormone-treated beef are commonly cited as products that should be excluded on these grounds. But such a ban, if enacted, could be deployed against many other foods. For example, Britain currently imports rapeseed (canola, to Americans) from countries that are allowed to use a group of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which are banned in the eu, and therefore in Britain.
Amendments to this effect were added by the House of Lords only to be rejected by the Commons. But the campaign is likely to revive as Britain gets into trade negotiations. It is backed by an impressive and diverse line-up, from the Mail on Sunday to television chefs such as Prue Leith and Jamie Oliver to environmental groups like Greenpeace, and is hugely popular. If nothing else, a campaign that focuses on other countries' dismal environmental standards distracts attention from Britain's own poor record.
A second problem, which involves upland farms and especially sheep, may prove even harder to solve. In June last year Britain had 33m sheep and lambs, many of them destined to be killed and exported to the eu. In England 30% of them are in hilly regions classed as ""disadvantaged"", which include the Lake District, the Peak District, Exmoor and Dartmoor-the country's most sublime corners. Farms in these areas are often economically marginal even with subsidies. The average income from agricultural activity alone, before subsidies, in severely disadvantaged areas in 2018-19 was minus £22,000.
Whereas almost everyone can agree about how lowland crop farms ought to change-to become like Mr Top ham's, only more so-upland livestock farms divide opinion. Environmentalists such as George Monbiot, a campaigning writer, argue that sheep farming is almost invariably destructive, creating deserts of nibbled grass, and that the land should revert to scmb and trees. Nonsense, retorts James Rebanks, a Lake District shepherd (and a green after his own fashion) in his book ""English Pastoral"": ""Abandoning farmland isn't remotely the same thing as restoring a wild ecosystem-plagues of deer replace hordes of sheep and little good is achieved.""
""What people want is countryside easy to walk in and look at, a rough carpet kept free of messy undergrowth,"" observed David Lowenthal and Hugh Prince, respectively an American and a British geographer, in 1965. That is probably still true of the English. Although ecologists might not approve, people's eyes have grown fond of nibbled landscapes. And that is a problem for policymakers.
Jane Bassett farms sheep and cattle on 73 hectares of the Peak District. The small grassy fields on her land are divided by stone walls and scattered with mature trees. She has not applied for any environmental payment schemes, finding them too much hassle-""a lot of bureaucracy for fourteen hundred pounds"". She argues that she is creating environmental goods all the same. People flock to the area to admire and walk in the beautiful landscape and, if she is lucky, stay in her bed-and-breakfast. ""That vista"", she says, ""is maintained by having farmers in place.""
After many months of work, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has provided scant details of the ""environmental land management"" payment scheme that will be tested next year and fully introduced in 2024. Upland farmers do not believe that the new scheme will provide much money for hard-to-quantify public goods such as landscape. If they are right, the grand plan to replace per-hectare subsidies with green payments could be derailed quickly.
Upland farmers can plead poverty more convincingly than other farmers in England; they may also be able to point to Scottish and Welsh farmers, who will continue receiving automatic subsidies for longer. They are quite likely to enjoy support from English town-dwellers, who associate them with holidays. People care about the environment. But they might turn out to care more about landscape. *"

Rishi sunak is one of the most familiar figures in British politics. An assiduous public-relations campaign has ensured that the newspapers bulge with profiles of him and his photogenic family. Pundits speculate about how long it will be before he moves into Number 10. Economic policy is now associated with his skinny suits and easy smile in much the same way that it was once associated with Gordon Brown's crumpled clothes and grumpy scowl.
Yet beyond Mr Sunak's fabulous wealth and professional competence, not much is known about him. There are several reasons for this opacity. His rise has been so swift that he has left few traces. In early 2015 he was just another bored banker looking for a safe Conservative seat. By early 2019 he was a junior local-government minister dealing with public lavatories. From there he vaulted into Number 11.
The Conservative Party's various factions project what they want onto the young chancellor: social liberals see him as one of their own because he is from an ethnic minority, while right-wingers welcome him as a fellow-Brexiteer. Mr Sunak's pr team keeps the screen as blank as possible. Revelations that he likes ""Star Wars"" and Christmas songs have not been followed by disclosures about his philosophy of life or what makes him tick as a politician. But the deeper reason is that Mr Sunak has two warring identities.
The first identity is that of a pragmatist who tacks to the political winds. He got the job of chancellor when his predecessor, Sajid Javid, fell out with Boris Johnson over plans by the prime minister's now-departed chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for Number 10 to seize control of economic policy. As an mp for Richmond, in North Yorkshire, who campaigned energetically across the North of England in the December election, he is an enthusiastic supporter of the prime minister's agenda of ""levelling up"" the country and consolidating the party's recent gains in poorer places far from London. When the covid-19 crisis broke, he announced that ""this is not the time for ideology and orthodoxy"" and that he was willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the country from disaster. His first budget represented ""the largest sustained fiscal boost for 30 years"".
The spending review which he delivered with his usual aplomb on November 25th was designed by Rishi-the-pragmatist, whose Keynesian mantra is ""we're prioritising jobs"" and who reeled off a mind-boggling list of spending commitments. It was also a very political budget. Mr Sunak boasted of the ""highest sustained level of public investment in more than 40 years"", repeatedly nodded to manifesto commitments to build more hospitals and increase police numbers, and conveniently scattered his largesse around marginal northern constituencies.
But there is another, more ideological Rishi. Mr Sunak may be a social liberal who took his parliamentary oath on a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, but he is also a chip off the old Thatcherite block, even down to the stories about working in the family shop. His parents were immigrants who scrimped to send him to Winchester College, one of the country's best and most expensive schools. He spent his early career in two of the world's centres of creative destruction-working for Goldman Sachs in New York and studying business at Stanford University in Silicon Valley. He has the same bullish pride in being British as Margaret Thatcher had. He values the country's institutions-he describes his time at Winchester (where he was head boy) as ""absolutely marvellous""-loves cricket and football, and relishes the rural rituals in his constituency. He came out in favour of leaving the eu in 2015, even though the party establishment was vigorously pro-Remain-a brave position for an ambitious new arrival.
He also has the same ingrained enthusiasm for balancing budgets and limiting expenditure as the grocer's daughter had. He likes to tell the story of how he learned the rudiments of economics, including the importance of things like National Insurance and vat rates, by helping his mother do the accounts at her pharmacy when he was still at school. In one of his first speeches in parliament in 2015 he noted that tax receipts had remained at around 36-38% of the economy since 1955 and that this suggested a ""natural ceiling to what any government can extract from the pockets of its hard-working taxpayers"". In his speech to this year's virtual Conservative Party conference he vowed to balance the budget in the medium term and spoke about the ""sacred duty"" to leave the finances strong.
Showing steel
Which Rishi Sunak will dominate in the long term? While interest rates remain low, there will be little pressure for him to balance the books. Even so, the chancellor's Thatcherite instincts are likely to play a growing role in shaping British politics. There were flashes of steel in the spending-review announcement. Mr Sunak not only froze most public-sector wages and reduced foreign aid from 0.7% of gdp to 0.5% (which would have delighted Thatcher). He also reduced planned spending: excluding emergency expenditure on the virus, he cut more than £10bn a year from departmental spending plans next year. As the economy recovers, the Thatcherite Rishi is likely to become more assertive.
Mr Cummings's attempt to grab power from Number nfailed, at least in part because the Treasury has performed so much better than other departments have in the course of the pandemic. Mr Sunak's reputation in his party and the country has continued to rise as Mr Johnson's has sunk. He has also acquired a cohort of influential supporters among mps as his star has risen. Strong chancellors have always used their power in the past to shape policy and the economy. Nigel Lawson was a joint architect of Thatcherism, and Gordon Brown ran a rival domestic administration to Tony Blair. Under Mr Sunak, the ghost of Thatcher, handbag and all, will stalk the corridors of power. *"

STOCKHOLM
How long will Sweden's nationalists be excluded from power?
Two young men, Andreas Palmlov and Julian Kroon, sit in a bar swapping anecdotes about their native Sweden. The welfare system is so lax that an immigrant drew benefits while serving as the defence minister of Iraq. A lecturer was suspended because students complained that a lesson about fatherhood was heteronormative. And 1m kroner ($116,000) of taxpayers' cash was lavished on art intended not for human eyes but those of birds and beetles.
Some of the details are disputed. The Iraqi politician, Najah al-Shammari, a Swedish citizen, denies committing benefit fraud. But stories like these help explain why Mr Palmlov and Mr Kroon are members of the Sweden Democrats, a nationalist party. They believe that Sweden is under threat: from immigrants who drain the welfare state, from radicals who undermine traditional values and from an establishment that stigmatises voices of common sense like their own.
Storytelling matters in politics. Voters remember a good yarn more easily than any statistic. And the Sweden Democrats tell a simple, emotive one: that non-European immigrants are ruining Sweden, and a left-wing government is letting them.
In 1988, when it was founded, the party was dismissed as a rabble of neo-Nazis. But since the 1990s it has purged overt racists and cleaned up its image. It gained momentum in 2015 when Sweden opened its doors to refugees, letting in over 160,000 (1.6% of the population), mostly from culturally distant places such as Syria and Afghanistan. The government mishandled the influx, showering the newcomers with handouts but making it hard for them to work. (For example, the de facto minimum wage in shops, hotels and restaurants is nearly 90% of the average wage in those industries, pricing newcomers who are still learning Swedish out of entry-level jobs.) The open-door policy was quickly reversed. But the sight of so many jobless Muslims lent credibility to the Sweden Democrats' message. At an election in 2018, the party won 17.5% of the vote. To keep it out of power, mainstream parties have had to form unstable coalitions.
An upsurge in violence between ethnic gangs (see next article) has given the Sweden Democrats another boost. ""The majority society is losing control over areas of Sweden,"" says Mattias Karlsson (pictured, with waistcoat), an mp and the party's unofficial chief ideologue. He wants to hire more police, pay them better and swiftly deport foreign criminals. When an Afghan commits a crime in Sweden, he says, ""human-rights people say we can't guarantee his safety in Afghanistan, so they let him out on the streets again.""
An increase in recorded sex crimes ""is to a large extent cultural"", says Mr Karlsson, noting that Sweden took in many refugees from sexist countries. Reality is more complicated. Sweden expanded its definition of rape in 2013, and counts it differently from other countries. If a woman says her boyfriend assaulted her daily for a year, Sweden records 365 offences; other countries might record only one. So the claim, common on alt-right websites, that immigration has made Sweden the ""rape capital of the world"", is nonsense.
Still, crime rates among refugees really are higher than among native-born Swedes, partly because so many are jobless. Other parties approach the topic gingerly, for fear of sounding racist. The Sweden Democrats have no such hang-ups. ""We say what you think,"" is their slogan.
The party is planning for the long term. Its leaders swap notes with American Republicans. Mr Karlsson has set up a thinktank. Mr Kroon runs a fast-growing federation for students. Many are ""tired of political correctness"", he says, and need ""a new home"" outside the ""opinion corridor"" of socially acceptable (ie, left-liberal) views.
At the national level, centre-right parties have resisted the temptation to cut a deal with the Sweden Democrats, though it would give them a swift path to power. But the taboo is fading. Local politicians have already taken the plunge. The Sweden Democrats enjoy power or a share of it in several towns, especially in the conservative south. Some of their local leaders are risibly incompetent. But others are eager to show that they are not scary and can handle the humdrum tasks of government.
The party's showcase is Solvesborg, a town of 17,000. The mayor, Louise Erixon, is the ex-partner of the party's national leader, Jimmie Akesson. She is popular, pro-business and unashamedly populist. She boasts of hiring more security guards, banning begging and barring visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly from covid-19. She favours drug tests in schools, and repatriation for immigrants ""who refuse to be a part of [Swedish] society"". She accuses the mainstream parties of weakening ""good old Swedish togetherness"". She is thought to have national ambitions.
Ms Erixon came to power thanks to a deal with the centre-right Moderate party, whose national leaders opposed it. But a local one, Emilie Pilthammar, went ahead, for bread-and-butter reasons. Ms Pilthammar says she wanted to bring down a cronyist left-wing administration, boost local business and provide more choice in child care. However she later fell out with Ms Erixon, who she says would give councillors only a few minutes to read key documents before making a decision on them- something she says was bad for democracy. (Ms Erixon denies this.)
Mr Karlsson is ""very optimistic"" that the Sweden Democrats will gain a share of national power, perhaps after an election in 2022. Nils Karlson (no relation) of Ratio, a research institute, predicts that the centreright will not join a formal coalition with them but might form a looser arrangement, whereby the Sweden Democrats ""consent"" to a centre-right government in exchange for policy concessions. ""That scares me a lot,"" he adds.
Meanwhile, the mainstream parties have all but adopted the Sweden Democrats' policies on shutting out new refugees. Mattias Karlsson's suggestion that Sweden does not send Afghans back to Afghanistan would come as news to Jacob (not his real name), who was deported last year. His claim to asylum appeared watertight: he arrived in Sweden as a 14-year-old orphan and a member of a persecuted minority. He had fled Afghanistan after his father disappeared (and was probably murdered by the Taliban). He has studied hard, learned Swedish and stayed out of trouble. He is now back in Kabul taking maths classes. ""Yesterday when I was in school, a rocket exploded outside. And again today. It's hard,"" he says. The Swedish family who took him in while he was in Sweden, the Winbergs, have found him a permanent job at a trendy vegetarian restaurant in Stockholm. In theory, he should get a work visa and be allowed to return. But Hans Winberg, an academic, frets that the government is doing everything it can to keep refugees out. ""The climate has changed,"" he says. ""This is painful to me as a Swede."" But many Swedes welcome it. *"

STOCKHOLM
Sweden struggles to curb gang violence
In august a criminal clan set up roadblocks in Gothenburg to catch members of a rival gang. The police intervened and made several arrests, but failed to charge anyone. The gang war in Gothenburg eventually ended not because the cops stopped it, but because the gangsters negotiated a truce. Swedes are shocked to see such instances of the forces of law and order losing control of the country's streets.
Sweden remains exceptionally safe-its murder rate is only a fifth of America's. But a surge of spectacular gang crimes has captured public attention. This summer two Swedish teenagers were tortured and raped in a cemetery in a so-called humiliation crime. In the first half of this year 20 people, mostly young men, were killed in 163 shootings. A study in 2018 found that a man aged 15 to 29 in Sweden is ten times more likely to get shot than in Germany.
The problem is concentrated in highly segregated immigrant neighbourhoods. In Husby, a suburb of Stockholm, more than 80% of the population are migrants or the children of migrants, most of them from Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Turkey. The scene of ugly riots seven years ago, Husby is officially classified as one of 22 ""extremely vulnerable areas"" prone to crime and violence. Unemployment in such neighbourhoods is high. Thanks to restrictive labour rules, it is hard for unskilled newcomers to find jobs. Many teenage boys skip school; gangs offer a sense of purpose and belonging.
Around half the street-gang members are foreign-born; 85% have an immigrant background. The gangs are loosely organised, without a strict hierarchy. Their frequent use of extreme violence is a sign of immaturity, says Amir Rostami of Stockholm University. More mature gangs in Germany are less violent, he explains, because it is ""bad for business"".
Many native Swedes are calling for tougher policing. So are many immigrants, who suffer most from crime. Sweden has only two cops per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with three in Germany. The government recently decided to hire 6,000 more police and 4,000 in supporting jobs by 2024. Erik Nord, chief of the Gothenburg police, wants 10,000 more officers (and the 4,000 support staff), and more camera surveillance too. The police were only recently allowed to tap criminals' phones.
Operation Hoarfrost, launched after the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old in November last year, brought in police from across Sweden to crack down on crime in Malmo, a southern city. In recent years the culprit has been arrested in only 20% of gangland murders. The city hopes that more officers and better policing methods will improve this dismal record.
Sweden is also trying to learn from nearby Denmark and Germany. ""We want to follow the Danish model,"" says Johan Forssell, an mp for the centre-right Moderate party, pointing out that gang members from Stockholm who committed a murder in Denmark were sentenced to 20 years in prison, whereas in Sweden they would have got four years in a social institution because they were under 18.
Police from Sweden went to Essen and Berlin, German cities with high levels of clan criminality, to study local policing. In particular, the Swedes are considering Germany's tougher gun laws and its methods for confiscating criminal funds. It will take time to reverse the trend, says Mr Rostami, but Sweden is belatedly confronting it. *"

PALERMO
Can a famously corrupt island secure its share of the eu's covid-19 fund?
Sebastiano (""nello) musumeci, the governor of Sicily, counts off on his fingers some of the many things he says his island lacks: a hub-port to tap into the goods traffic that flows from the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean; an international airport (""Malta, smaller than the smallest Sicilian province, has one, he notes indignantly); a modern rail system (large stretches of the existing network are either single-track or unelectrified, or both); and a motorway that fully encircles the triangular island (there is a long gap on one side). ""Then there is all the social infrastructure we lack, he goes on. Top of that list is a shortage of nursery schools.
Europe's efforts to recover from covid-19 focus on poorer regions like Sicily. One of the aims of its €75obn recovery fund, currently blocked by Poland and Hungary (see Charlemagne) but due to come on stream next year, is to ""level up the eu. The Italian government will soon spell out to the European Commission how it wants to spend its share of the loans and grants on offer-more than a quarter of the total, says the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Last month, Sicily's regional government sent Rome a list of schemes it hopes will qualify for funding. But although the island's needs are great, the eu scheme may not help to satisfy them.
Most of the projects the regional government wants for the island are largescale, long-term and designed to fulfil relatively basic requirements. But the conditions attached to the eu's main recovery fund prioritise schemes that are ""smart, green and can be completed quite fast. Vincenzo Provenzano, who teaches economics at the university of Palermo, worries that the regional government's aims may be too ambitious and that it ought to focus more on the potential of the eu's promised Green Deal. ""If we want to have immediate effects, we need to work on areas where Sicily has a comparative advantage, he says. Organic farming, which Sicily has a lot of, is a perfect example.
Other doubts over Sicily's capacity to benefit from this unique opportunity have a longer history. The island's bureaucracy is notoriously sluggish. It may struggle to meet the deadlines set for having access to the eu's funds: 70% of the money has to be committed, with contracts awarded and signed, by the end of 2022, the remaining 30% within the year after. The entire fund has to be spent by the end of 2026. Sicily has in the past found it hard to devise projects suitable for eu funding and then spend the money it has been given.
In any event, a worry persists that eu or state money invested in Sicily will enrich the island's Mafia, known to affiliates as Cosa Nostra (""Our Thing). In this respect there are grounds for optimism. Once the beefiest of Italy's three main organisedcrime syndicates, Cosa Nostra has been losing ground since the 1990s to the Camorra, which operates in and around Naples, and to the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta. Since the early 1990s police and prosecutors have relentlessly pursued it. Under Mr Musumeci, a former president of Sicily's anti-Mafia commission, they have had solid backing from the regional authorities.
One reason Cosa Nostra has retreated from the streets is that it has increasingly concentrated on white-collar crime. As many investigations have shown, it is still able to muscle in on the allocation of contracts and has a special penchant for helping itself to eu financing.
That has prompted the creation of numerous laws and regulations which are intended to thwart the mobsters' infiltration of the legal economy but which also slow down the approval of public investment projects. Mr Musumeci argues that the precautions have become excessive. He wants the central government to simplify the procedures for being granted the eu's funds. ""We can't not look to the future, he says. *"

BERLIN AND PARIS
The imminent Biden presidency reawakens the European defence debate
Emmanuel macron does not shy from controversy. But the French president's recent dig at Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Germany's defence minister, was sharp. Earlier this month she wrote: ""Illusions of European strategic autonomy must come to an end."" Since ""strategic autonomy"" is a centrepiece of Mr Macron's European ambitions, he did not hold back. Calling her views a ""historical misinterpretation"", he added pointedly: ""Fortunately, if I understood things correctly, the chancellor does not share this point of view.""
Franco-German differences are not just normal; they are the basis of the post-war Franco-German link. Usually leaders try to avoid making disagreements personal, and work through them in private. This time, the spat is out in the open. As Europeans prepare for an American presidency under Joe Biden, it has exposed old cracks within the European Union over how far Europe should, or could, do more to defend itself.
Under Donald Trump, Mr Macron edged the European debate in his direction. An American president with undisguised contempt for nato helped focus European minds, and prompted concerns about the solidity of the American security guarantee. In terms of capacity, European defence 1 does not yet add up to much. An alphabet soup of embryonic security programmes focuses on new co-operation mechanisms, rather than step-changes in Europe's ability to handle collective defence. Yet France and Germany now agree that Europe must do more. German defence spending, though a smaller share of gdp than in France, has been growing steadily since 2015. A common eu military-strategy document will be concluded under France's eu presidency in 2022. A new poll finds that 51% of Germans think Europe should grow more independent of America. There is deepening European co-operation in a counter-terrorism operation in the Sahel, albeit with American intelligence backing.
So why do France and Germany appear to be talking past one another? Mr Macron has neither called for America to withdraw from Europe, nor suggested that nato is ""superfluous"", as Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer has hinted. He sees beefing up European defence as a response to a pre-Trump American pivot to Asia, and stresses that it should be ""complementary"" to nato. In Germany the deeper divide is not between pro-NATO Atlanticists and pro-Europeans; but between those, like Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer, who encourage difficult domestic conversations about defence spending and military capabilities, and those who would prefer to ignore the subject. If Mr Macron worries that a Biden administration will induce the German establishment back into deep strategic sleep, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer ought to be among his closest allies in Berlin, not the subject of his barbs.
The difficulty may stem partly from language. Mr Macron uses ""European sovereignty"" and ""strategic autonomy"" almost interchangeably, sometimes to cover broader industrial and technological independence. Yet full defence sovereignty means a great deal more than merely Europe's ability to act autonomously, for example to resolve a limited regional crisis. As Mr Macron pointed out in a speech to the Bundestag in 2018: ""In France, 'sovereignty' is a common term; in Germany I know it can cause surprise, even fear."" Many Germans also resist Mr Macron's emphasis on ""strategic autonomy"", preferring to talk about the ""European pillar of nato"" in order to avoid ambiguity about America's security role in Europe.
There is also old distrust in Berlin (and elsewhere in the eu) about French intentions. Some officials see in Mr Macron an old-style Gaullist wrapping French interests in a European flag. They suspect him of seeking to undermine nato and substitute French leadership in Europe for American influence. Others appreciate Mr Macron's energy but find his unilateralism exhausting-and sometimes counter-productive, as in Libya or the eastern Mediterranean.
Above all, the gulf between the two countries' defence cultures is just extremely hard to bridge. Defence, says Claudia Major of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, remains the ""problem child"". France has a tradition of military intervention and the use of expeditionary force (and boasts nuclear weapons); Germany's culture of military restraint is as strong as ever, and politicians struggle to articulate a national strategic interest. Where France instinctively sees threats to Europe's south, Germans look eastward-and take seriously scepticism towards Mr Macron from eastern Europeans who balk at any hint of weakening transatlantic security ties. The defence minister of Poland has intervened in the spat to say he agrees with the Germans (as has Spain's prime minister).
If Europeans accept the need to ""do more"" for their own defence, they have yet to agree on what this means. The idea of partial defence autonomy commands wide and growing support, but not when coupled with the more ambitious and pricey idea of total sovereignty in defence. Instead of a war of words, Europeans must work out what capabilities they need and when, and how to pay for them-no matter who is president in America. *"

WARSAW
The ruling party pays homage to rural music
Love, love in Zakopane. We re show ering ourselves in champagne. I am the knight, and you, queen of the night."" The balding singer with a stubby moustache and sequined blazer slid across the stage. It was a chilly New Year's Eve in 2018, but the crowd of 60,000 sang along in the resort town of Zakopane in the foothills of the Tatra mountains. Another 8m Poles watched the public broadcaster's flagship concert from home, triple the peak viewing figures of its rival television stations.
Disco polo, a musical genre once relegated to country wedding bandstands, has strutted onto the main stage. Created in rural Poland in the late 1980s, it blends folk tunes with drum machines and synthesisers, often with saucy lyrics. ""Polka Dot Knickers"", a hit song in 1995, offended many sensibilities. But the genre has bounced back. Almost twothirds of Poles-and 80% of them in rural areas-say they enjoy it. ""Love in Zakopane"" has had 226m views on YouTube.
Disco polo bands now perform at venues such as Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science and London's 02 Arena. In September a school in Michalowo, in eastern Poland, launched the country's first class aimed at making a career in disco polo. This year's inaugural class of 27 highschoolers is coached in singing and dancing, and learns the technicalities of sound systems. The minister of education at the time commended it: ""Maybe it'll catch on."" The town is building a disco-polo museum.
Polish politicians have long sucked up to disco-polo fans. Back in the presidential campaign of 1995, the two frontrunners were both backed by disco-polo artists. But the patronage afforded to musicians under the ruling Law and Justice party is quite new. Earlier this year TVP, Poland's public broadcaster, released a hagiography of the disco-polo doyen, Zenek Martyniuk. After singing along at one of his concerts, the station's boss, a Law and Justice politician, said it was time to end ""the hypocrisy and pretence that this is an inferior genre"".
The ruling party has good reason to indulge disco polo's enthusiasts-they are its core supporters. In last year's parliamentary elections it got roughly twice the vote-share in rural regions, the heartland of the simple tunes, as it did in big cities. TVP has denounced any politicians or cultural gurus who sneer at disco polo as out of touch with ""ordinary"" Poles. After its record-breaking viewing figures for the New Year's Eve concert in 2019 starring Mr Martyniuk, the station ran a gloating segment: ""The pseudo-elites are jealous."""

Inertia is isaac newton's first law of motion. ""Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon,"" wrote Newton in 1687. It is the first law of the eu, too: things stay as they are, until a big enough force shoves them to change. The covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing recession gave the bloc an almighty push. Over the summer eu leaders agreed to issue collective debt at scale for the first time, to the tune of €750bn ($890bn). After five days of talks, all 27 heads of government agreed that anyone spending eu money would have to abide by some form of ""rule of law"" stipulations.
Hungary and Poland are learning the hard way about introductory physics: once things get going, they are hard to stop. The two countries have belatedly teamed up to try and scupper the scheme, arguing that the rule-of-law mechanism goes too far. They have reason to fear a crackdown. Both governments have trampled on democratic norms in recent years, nobbling judges, thwarting journalists and using the state to hobble rivals. There is little Hungary and Poland can do to stop the new rules coming in, since they can be approved by a qualified majority. Instead, they have vetoed other policies. Both have refused to sign off the eu's budget, which is worth about €1trn of spending over seven years, and withheld permission for the eu to push on with disbursing the €75obn recovery fund, until the rule-of-law scheme is watered down.
Leverage is the stuff of politics as well as physics. At first glance, holding €i.8trn of funding hostage seems a strong lever to pull. Economies in southern Europe are gasping for the cash. But it is a kamikaze attack. eu funds to Hungary and Poland were worth 4.5% and 3% of those countries' gdp respectively in 2019. It is their own economies they are most in danger of damaging for the sake of a law they cannot stop from being introduced. Some are interpreting the move as a warning shot. If Hungary and Poland are trampled over, a bureaucratic dirty war will commence, with both countries blocking everything they can.
But Newton's third law also has a role in eu politics: every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Other countries have vetoes over the budget process. Some like the Netherlands, which has a reputation for being a stickler for rules, could block the process if any compromise goes too far. The rule-of-law legislation is narrowly defined. Some countries wanted a far more wide-ranging tool, which would hit governments in their wallets if they trampled on the rights of minorities or gay people.
A nuclear option being discussed in a stage whisper by diplomats (and bellowed by meps) would involve other countries simply bypassing the two countries and issuing the debt without them. This would banish Hungary and Poland to an outer circle of the continent. Such strategies have been used before. David Cameron, then the British prime minister, found himself outwitted in 2011 when he refused to sign off on a treaty change without regulatory guarantees for the City of London. His fellow leaders went around him. Mr Cameron's failure offers a lesson in how not to deal with Brussels, which Warsaw and Budapest would do well to heed if they want to guarantee their place in the bloc. Oddly enough, voters in both countries are strongly Europhile, despite electing governments that enjoy fighting eu institutions.
Once the eu's rule-of-law tool has come into force, inertia may become the friend of Hungary and Poland, rather than their foe. Any punishment for trampling on the rule of law would have to be approved by a qualified majority of member states. On paper, this improves on the current system. At the moment, a country can be fined and/or stripped of its voting rights for violating the rule of law only if all 26 other governments agree. Since Hungary and Poland have each other's backs, such a move is impossible. In practice, the new measures may still struggle to be invoked. Hungary and Poland are far from the only countries nervous about eu budget payments being linked to good behaviour. Corruption allegations swirl in Bulgaria. High-profile murders of investigative journalists in Malta and Slovakia have shaken both countries in recent years. Cyprus sells passports. Croatian authorities are accused of beating up refugees at the border. It is not just a case of honour among thieves. eu leaders are reluctant to interfere in the domestic affairs of others for the simple reason that they fear they could be next. In such circumstances, abstention is appealing.
Unlike rules of physics, rules of politics can be bent. The danger is that the new mechanism will become another Stability and Growth Pact, the bloc's oft-maligned but usually ignored rules on government spending. According to the pact, eu countries are expected to keep their deficits below 3% of gdp in any given year and their debts below 60% of gdp. Even in good times, these targets were missed, but consequences were few. Technically countries could be fined. None ever was. To critics, the rule-of-law mechanism is a very European compromise: strict rules (to placate supporters) which are never enforced (to placate opponents).
Errors are not in the art but in the artificers
Procedures for reining in misbehaving member states will do little if no one has the guts to use them. Fundamentally, dealing with rogue eu governments is a question of political courage. Big countries, such as Germany, have allowed political alliances to trump principles. Over the past decade, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has reshaped the Hungarian state from within the comfort of the European People's Party, in which Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats also sit. Belated action on Poland-a far more important country for the future of Europe-came only after its government had already stacked its constitutional court. The bloc's failure to act has had consequences. Other countries are sliding in a similar direction and will not stop unless some force impresses thereon. Inertia, after all, is a mighty thing. *"

America is about to roll out a covid-19 vaccine. Here is how the federal government and states plan to do it
Asked what keeps her up at night as Texas prepares for the arrival of the first covid-19 vaccines, Imelda Garcia from the state's health department singles out two opposite scenarios: either a serious shortage of vaccine, or lots of it sitting around unused because nobody wants to take it. These two worries are on the minds of many other public-health experts as 6.4m doses of vaccine stand ready to be dispatched across America, on a nod by the Food and Drug Administration (fda), the federal drug regulator.
That nod is expected on December 10th or shortly after, when the fda will make a decision on the first covid-19 vaccine submitted for approval in America, a jab developed by the drug firms Pfizer and BioNTech. Moderna, the developer of another vaccine, is expected to undergo fda review on December 17th. Both vaccines are about 95% effective if administered in a two-dose regimen. They are unlikely to stem America's runaway epidemic until next spring, at best. But America is leading the way on covid-19 vaccination-so lessons from its early experience will be closely watched in Europe and other parts of the world.
Organising America's supplies of covid-19 vaccines is the task of Operation Warp Speed, a programme set up by the current administration in May. It pre-purchased 100m doses of both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines this summer, and large quantities have already been made. Each firm expects to have about 20m doses ready to distribute in America by the end of this year. This amount is roughly what would be needed to inoculate all America's health-care workers, who are a priority group for the first vaccine supplies.
Next will come groups particularly vulnerable to the disease, including essential workers at high risk of infection (such as police officers, teachers and bus drivers), care-home residents, people with highrisk medical conditions and those over 65. The order of priority between these groups, which are suggested by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc) and other national health agencies, may vary somewhat from state to state. The current plan is that vaccine supplies, as they become available, will be divvied up among states and six big metropolitan areas proportionately to their population. Each state will decide how to distribute them. At the current pace of vaccine production, widespread vaccination of the elderly is not on the cards until February.
The logistics of vaccinating more than 300m Americans would be daunting with any vaccine. But Pfizer's will be ""extremely challenging"", says Claire Hannan of the Association of Immunisation Managers. ""It's nothing like we've seen before,"" she says. The vaccine must be stored at -70°C, which 1 is the temperature in ultra-freezers rarely found outside research laboratories and big medical centres. To deal with that, Pfizer will be distributing the vaccine in ""thermal shippers"", special containers packed with dry ice designed to hold between about 1,000 and 5,000 doses. (It is now designing a smaller version to make distribution easier.) But the dry ice must be replenished regularly, the container can be opened only twice a day and, once taken out, the vaccine lasts in a regular fridge for only five days. When ready to administer, it must be diluted with saline, which is also not a common step for vaccines.
People handling the Pfizer vaccine will need extensive training, says Ms Hannan. ""This isn't something where you can watch the video and then you are ready to go."" She worries that these new procedures will come at a time when hospitals and their staff are overwhelmed and exhausted by the flood of patients (see next story). Because of all the intricacies involved, a fair amount of the first supplies of Pfizer's vaccine may end up being spoilt.
Moderna's vaccine is more in line with what vaccinators are already used to. It must be stored at -20°C, the temperature of standard pharmacy freezers, keeps in a regular fridge for 30 days, comes in packs of 100 doses and does not need dilution. This vaccine, if approved, would be delivered by McKesson, a medical distributor that already delivers vaccines nationally.
Wherever the vaccines arrive, supplies to do the jabs must turn up at the same time. These will be distributed by McKesson in pre-assembled packs of the syringes, alcohol wipes, gloves and other items needed for each covid-19 jab. Operation Warp Speed has been stockpiling these through the summer-to avoid a repeat of the fiasco with personal protective equipment for health workers in the spring, when state and federal authorities were competing with each other in a mad scramble for scarce global supplies.
At present, states and the Department of Defence, which is leading the logistics of vaccine distribution, are focused on preparing for Pfizer's vaccine. State authorities have been enrolling vaccination providers, drawing up lists of health workers and others who need to be vaccinated first, and setting up systems to keep track of vaccines. They have just started doing ""dry runs"", placing vaccine and syringe orders into the national system and practising what they will be doing with Pfizer's thermal shippers (which, for now, arrive with empty vials).
The logistics of moving vaccines around will be complicated. The really hard part, though, will probably be convincing people to take them. America's plan is to make vaccination available free at all the usual places where people get their flu shots, such as pharmacies and doctors' surgeries. The federal government is setting up a fund to cover providers' fees for the jab for the uninsured; health plans will cover this fee for their members.
Many immunisation experts worry that this ""build it and they will come"" approach is naive. At the moment, surveys suggest that anywhere between 20% and 60% of Americans may not accept a covid-19 vaccine. In one survey only a third of nurses said they would voluntarily get vaccinated. Some people are worried that the vaccines may not be safe, suspicious that corners may have been cut in the rush to develop them so quickly. Others have seen various kinds of alarming misinformation. Muddled messages from various political leaders have also done their share of harm.
All vaccinators, therefore, must be well trained to answer people's questions about the risks and benefits of the vaccine, potential side effects, the longevity of protection and so on. But such training has not yet started, partly because this sort of box-insert information will be published officially as part of fda's decision on the vaccine. In some places, such as Washington, dc, health departments have started talking to community leaders to get a sense of the particular concerns of various groups. Media campaigns to encourage people to get vaccinated will be important.
All this will throw up unfamiliar challenges. Unlike many other countries, America has a more ""passive"" approach to vaccination and is not used to doing big immunisation campaigns, says Tom Kenyon from Project hope, a health non-profit, who used to lead the cdc's global health programme. This works for childhood vaccination. But covid-19 is different. Lots of mini vaccination drives to cover specific groups, such as frontline workers, will be crucial, says Dr Kenyon.
This sort of groundwork, training and campaigning is expensive. The Association of Immunisation Managers estimates that, all told, state and local authorities will need $8.4bn. The cdc has put the total at around $6bn. So far, however, states have received only $200m for vaccination preparation, and a promise of another $140m this year. Approval of a big federal pot of money for this has been caught up in the political wrangling in Washington. The Moderna vaccine, developed with America's National Institutes of Health, is a triumph of American science. Failing to vaccinate enough people to stop the virus would be a failure of American politics. *"

CHICAGO
Covid-19 is killing over 550 Midwesterners every day
""We as physicians struggle to conW W of the idea of exponential growth,"" says Dan Runde, of the emergency medicine department at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, in Iowa City. ""There's so short a window. You go from barely handling things, to not at all. It's so fast."" He recalls how Iowa had some 700 patients in hospital infected with covid-19 at the start of November. A few weeks later, he says, that tally had doubled. At times almost every icu bed is filled.
His hospital, like others, tried preparing for such a surge. In-patients, where possible, were sent home; a dozen new icu beds were added; some elective surgeries were postponed. Then staff watched in alarm as nearly one in every two covid-19 tests run in Iowa turned out positive, foretelling a surge in hospitalisation-and deaths. His hospital, the state's best-equipped, takes in patients from far and wide when others can't cope. That already means an ""aggressive triage process"". ""We're already getting to the line to be full. We have to start saying no. If you're not going to die in the next six to 12 hours, then you have to wait,"" he says.
Iowa's hospital system is not overwhelmed, but it could be soon, just as wards are rapidly filling in Ohio and Pennsylvania. ""I'm very concerned, bordering on terrified,"" says the doctor. He worries that members of the public, and governing politicians, don't grasp what happens 1 when hospitals overfill. Not only covid-19 patients suffer; disruptions also threaten care for those afflicted by cancer, heart disease, car accidents and more. Rates of excess, non-virus deaths could surge. Across Iowa, 80% of icu beds are now occupied. In North Dakota it is over 90%.
Smaller hospitals suffer the greatest strain-not least because 130 rural ones closed across America in the past decade, putting pressure on those that remain. Ben Christians, an emergency-care doctor at one in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, says it has just experienced by far ""the worst month"" of the entire pandemic, eclipsing the outbreak in the spring. For the past two months ""we've been functioning at over 100%"" of icu beds, and adding other sorts, he says. Finding enough trained staff is the biggest constraint. He admits patients from 80 sparsely populated but ever more afflicted counties, sometimes over 150 miles away. The smallest rural clinics, with just a handful of beds and a single doctor, are easily overrun.
Across South Dakota, by November 25th, 43% of covid tests were coming back positive-still terribly high, but a slight fall on before. At the main emergency ward, ""some days almost every patient is covidpositive"", he says. This is exhausting, because staff are constantly donning and removing cumbersome protective gear. Some fall ill, or endure what is sometimes called ""moral injury"". That means trauma, such as when nurses care for otherwise isolated, confused and slowly dying patients. Holding iPads so that relatives can share last words can upset health workers, too.
Doctors who need to get deteriorating patients into bigger hospitals have also struggled. Dr Runde helps to run patient transfers in Iowa and says it can take hours of calling hospitals, some in other states, to find a bed. As bigger hospitals in cities fill, less-sick patients are pushed back to smaller rural ones. In Sioux Falls another 1,000 patients, including 100 on supplemental oxygen, are monitored in their homes. Shuttling patients around is not ideal.
Frontline staff have learned better ways to treat patients, so mortality is not soaring along with infections. Kurt Chamberlain, an emergency doctor in eastern Iowa, says his hospital, St Lukes near Cedar Rapids, has 76 patients, far more than before: ""We couldn't have handled that in May."" Everyone knows, for example, that they must avoid putting patients (except the most desperate) on ventilators. Dr Christians estimates that only 5-10% of those who are intubated survive it. Emma Nash, an icu fellow at a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, says emergency oxygen is delivered, instead, via a high-powered nasal cannula.
At home, herself shivering from the virus, Dr Nash says hospital resources are spread thin. ""The rest of the country should see what's happening here and realise they're not out of the woods,"" she says. (Infections are surging again in the South, especially.) In mid-November the Midwest accounted for half of all new cases in nursing homes in America. Deaths are also ticking up. On average covid-19 is now killing over 1,550 Americans daily, with the dozen midwestern states accounting for an outsize share of that-560 deaths each day.
In North Dakota nearly one-in-ten people is a confirmed covid case. Why is the region so afflicted? People in northern states are probably meeting indoors, where coronavirus spreads most easily, more than those in warmer spots. Those in rural places, like north Wisconsin, who earlier avoided outbreaks may be shunning protective measures. And policymakers are at fault. Many Republican governors and legislators have long refused to shut bars or restaurants, order statewide mask-wearing or ban mass-gatherings-such as the Sturgis bike rally in South Dakota. All that helped to spread the virus.
Since the election a few, belatedly, have changed their tune. Kim Reynolds, Iowa's governor, at last issued a statewide mask mandate, after months of scorning the idea. North Dakota's governor, Doug Burgum, has done the same, also this month. Some cities, such as Sioux Falls and Omaha, do require masks, but in rural areas denial of the virus and rejection of mitigation efforts are both common.
Figures from recent days suggest infections may have fallen off from record highs in some states. But no one is cheering in the emergency wards. Health workers fear that Thanksgiving gatherings will prove to be superspreader moments. Ignoring pleas from public-health officials to stay home, many millions of Americans have flown and driven to family celebrations in the past few days. Meanwhile many college students have just gone home for the year. Dr Runde and the others all say that portends predictably grim results to come. ""It is like slow-motion horror. We're just standing there and being run over."""

WASHINGTON, DC
Joe Biden unveils a reassuringly familiar national-security team
Less than 24 hours after Donald Trump concluded that he could block the transition to Joe Biden's incoming administration no longer, the Democratic veteran took the stage alongside his chosen national-security team. ""America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it,"" he said. The happy gurgles of relief this elicited in Washington, dc, London, Tokyo and beyond may be imagined.
Even more than expected, Mr Biden's choices reflected a stress on unflashy expertise, pragmatism and personal loyalty. His secretary-of-state nominee and national security adviser, respectively Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan, are well-regarded Obama administration veterans. Mr Blinken, mild-mannered, impeccably coiffured and Francophone, served as the former vice-president's national security adviser and as a deputy secretary of state. Mr Sullivan, possessed of a first-rate intellect and slightly lesser coiffuring, was another well-liked Biden nsa.
Being friends, they would not be at each other's throats as Mike Pompeo and John Bolton were. The likely result of their partnership (cue more cooing) would be a return to low-key, competent governing, and a predictable foreign policy that reflects Mr Biden's long-standing views. Messrs Sullivan and Blinken could be expected to engage with global problems, through alliances where possible, and rebuild the institutions they were charged with. America, suggested Mr Blinken, should have the ""humility and confidence"" to rely on its allies. By choosing a relatively low-profile secretary, notwithstanding Mr Blinken's qualities, Mr Biden may additionally be signalling that he intends to do the highest-level diplomacy himself.
It was hard not to hear this as a repudiation of Mr Trump-and harder still when Mr Biden's chosen Director of National Intelligence (dni), Avril Haines, promised that, if confirmed by the Senate, she would ""continue speaking truth to power"". Another Obama administration veteran, and former deputy chief of the cia, she would be the first woman dni. Alejandro Mayorkas would be the first Latino and immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Mr Biden's chosen un ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield was a rare black woman at the heights of American diplomacy, before she was sacked by Mr Trump.
The diversity of Mr Biden's nominees is also from Mr Obama's playbook. It is intended in part to mollify the hard-left, whose champions the president-elect has otherwise ignored. His nomination of John Kerry, to be his empowered climate envoy, was another challenge to the left. Mr Kerry is a pillar of the reviled Democratic establishment; yet the left must love his newlycreated post. Mr Biden's nominees have been duly welcomed across the party. By way of dissent, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other lefties have limited themselves to signing a petition against the possible reappointment of Mr Biden's former chief of staff, Bruce Reed, a relatively obscure figure, on account of his past openness to welfare reform. If that constitutes the serious Democratic infighting that some news reports have described it as, Mr Biden can rest easy.
Stiffer criticism of Mr Biden's nominees has come from Republican hawks. Senator Marco Rubio characterised them as a bunch of privileged do-gooders who would be ""polite & orderly caretakers of America's decline"". That rather ignored the fact that most of Mr Trump's team are Ivy Leaguers, who have not restored American hegemony-and that Ms Thomas-Greenfield grew up poor in Louisiana. Yet Mr Rubio's spiky comments speak to a legitimate question about how Mr Biden's national security approach will differ from Mr Obama's.
Mr Sullivan and Mr Blinken have criticised the Obama administration's areas of diffidence (on Syria and China especially). Mr Biden has additionally underlined that the post-Trump world is different from the one his former boss presided over. On balance, that is probably to his advantage.
Besides lashings of goodwill, his administration will have some useful leverage to work with, in the form of Mr Trump's sanctions on Iran and tariffs on China. It will have little incentive to dispense with either in a hurry. Even if Iran can be persuaded to comply with the terms of the nuclear containment deal (negotiated by Mr Sullivan) that Mr Trump abrogated, Mr Biden would try to broaden it. And there is no appetite in Washington for giving China something for nothing. Notwithstanding the happy rhetoric, this might augur a foreign policy that is neither a total repudiation of Mr Trump's nor a re-embrace of Mr Obama's, but a cross between the two."

A book on the rapid increase in trans girls is denounced as transphobic
A teenage girl who decides to alter her body so that it resembles a boy's commits herself to a lifetime of medical treatments. ""Top surgery""-a double mastectomy-is a major operation. She must take regular, large doses of testosterone. This may increase her chance of developing heart problems. It also causes the uterus to atrophy, often painfully, which may necessitate a hysterectomy.
Some of the changes to her body will be irreversible, and likely to cause distress if she changes her mind. If she has taken puberty-blockers as well as testosterone she may well be infertile. Only a few months of testosterone may have altered her voice and given her a lifelong five o'clock shadow. Fortunately for such girls, ""bottom surgery""-a phalloplasty-is so often problematic that few request it.
All this, coupled with the fact that adolescence is confusing at the best of times, might suggest that teenagers should, by and large, be discouraged from embarking on biomedical gender reassignment. That is the argument running through ""Irreversible Damage,"" a book by Abigail Shrier, a journalist. It is not one that holds much sway in America. As the number of transgender clinics has grown from one in 2007 to at least 50 today, so has the number of young patients in them. Once they were mostly boys; today they are girls. Ms Shrier argues that many are victims of an ideology which holds that the feeling of being in the wrong body must be affirmed at all costs. It has fuelled a craze, she writes, to which teenage girls are particularly susceptible.
""Irreversible Damage"" is full of stories from the mostly white, privileged world in which this seems to have flourished. Teenagers, often awkward and anxious, who have lost themselves in an online world that lionises anyone who identifies as trans. YouTubers, who ""extol the glories of testosterone as if it were a protein shake"" and dismiss parents who are sceptical of trans-identification as ""toxic"". Teachers, who do not tell parents that their child is going by a different name at school. The group she reports on in greatest detail is parents. Many of them come across as hapless. Apparently unable to tell their children that feelings of pain and confusion, especially in adolescence, are part of life and usually pass, they instead hope therapists will sort everything out.
Ms Shrier is damning of some of the professionals who have built careers working with trans-identifying children. She points out that this is the only medical field apart from cosmetic surgery in which both diagnosis and treatment are determined by the patient. She describes doctors and therapists (who would ordinarily consider it their job to challenge their patients' assumptions) bowing to the judgment of vulnerable teenagers. They also, grievously, tell parents who do not accept that their daughters are boys that failing to affirm their identity may heighten the risk of suicide (research does not back this up).
Data on transgender medical interventions are poor-no one knows how many teenagers have transitioned-and one wonders at times if Ms Shrier may have become so steeped in the phenomenon that she exaggerates its reach. But she tells the stories of those she interviews with great care. She writes empathetically about the distress of gender dysphoria, ""the relentless chafe of a body that feels all wrong,"" and the experience of adults who have transitioned (a group that has long suffered discrimination). She quotes her interviewees at such length that it would be hard to claim she has misrepresented them.
Yet despite this the book has been denounced as transphobic. This month, a prominent lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted, from his personal account, that ""stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on"". A professor of English literature at Berkeley suggested that people should steal the book and burn it. Few mainstream newspapers have reviewed it, though it is one of the first accessible treatments of a subject that has generated much fascinated coverage.
This is a clear illustration of what the book claims: the dominance of an ideology that brooks no dissent or debate. One of the most shocking episodes it describes concerns Lisa Littman, a medical doctor and researcher at Brown University, who noted in a paper in 2018 that most transgender children were teenage girls with no history of gender dysphoria. Many of the teenagers in her study had been exposed to peers who had come out as trans shortly before doing so themselves; a majority had spent more time on the internet. The study sparked a bullying campaign, which prompted Brown to publish an apology, though the paper's findings never changed. She was fired from another job as a consultant.
In ""Irreversible Damage"" Ms Shrier describes meeting Dr Littman and wondering out loud about the cultural factors that might be causing so many American girls to want to become boys. She is impressed when Dr Littman refuses ""to theorise beyond the limits of her data"". This punctilious respect for the facts had threatened to destroy her career."

NEW YORK
The ""gay-panic"" defence remains legally admissible in 39 states
DANIEL SPENCER was a quiet, 32-year-old film editor who had recently moved to Austin, Texas from Los Angeles. He was also gay. In 2015 his neighbour, James Miller, stabbed him to death. The case was harrowing. But a legal quirk uncovered during the trial made it even worse. Mr Miller introduced the ""gaypanic"" defence in court, arguing that at some point on the night of the murder, Mr Spencer had tried to kiss him. The victim's apparent homosexuality had made Mr Miller fearful for his safety and thus diminished his responsibility. Despite a lack of physical evidence (and the fact that Mr Miller defended himself by stabbing the victim twice in the back), he was sentenced to just six months in jail, with ten years on probation.
The case was no anomaly. The ""gaypanic"" defence remains legally admissible in 39 states according to the Movement Advancement Project, a think-tank. It normally bolsters either insanity or self-defence claims, and its use goes back decades. The brutal 'candlestick murder' of Jack Dobbins in Charleston in 1958 resulted in a full acquittal of the man who confessed to the crime, based on the fact that the victim had allegedly made unwanted advances. Although attitudes to homosexuality have changed since then, the law in some places has not.
The defence is ""the problem hiding under the sofa"", says Jason Marsden, executive director of the Matthew Shepard Foundation, which lobbies against hate crimes. It occurs in so few cases, scattered across multiple jurisdictions, that it seldom attracts much attention.
The American legal system is no stranger to bizarre lines of defence. In 2013 Ethan Couch killed four people while drunk-driving in Texas. His lawyers successfully argued that the 16-yearold was suffering from ""affluenza"", having grown up sheltered by wealthy parents who had failed to teach him the consequences of his own actions (he initially avoided prison and was instead put on probation for ten years). Lawyers for Colin Ferguson, a Jamaican immigrant who killed six people on a train in New York in 1993, pursued a ""black-rage"" defence, claiming that a lifetime of racial prejudice had driven Mr Ferguson insane (they were unsuccessful).
But the track record of the ""gay-panic"" defence makes it particularly egregious. The fbi keeps no data on the sexuality of homicide victims, and state-by-state records on hate crimes are spotty, so numbers can be difficult to pin down. But Carsten Andresen, a criminal-justice professor at St Edward's University in Austin, Texas, has been busy compiling a database. His research shows that since the 1970s, gay- and trans-panic defences have reduced murder charges to lesser offences in 40% of the roughly 200 cases that he has identified. In just over 5% of cases, the perpetrator was acquitted or the charges dropped.
It took until 2014 for California to introduce the first ban on the defence (the state's attorney-general at the time, Kamala Harris, led efforts to push the ban through). Since then, ten more states have followed, most recently Colorado in July of this year. Proposed bans are in committee stages in a handful elsewhere, including Texas and Minnesota, but 30 statehouses remain silent on the issue. And the fact that a third of cases since 1970 have occurred in the past ten years suggests that the problem may be worsening, or at least that ""every step forward is followed by several steps back"", says Mr Andresen. For now, nearly two-thirds of gay Americans are living in states where their very existence can be claimed to be a reasonable cause for violence against them. Daniel Spencer probably did not know this when he invited his neighbour over for an evening of wine-drinking and guitar-playing."

Appalling as it has been to witness an American president try to steal an election, Donald Trump's efforts have amounted to less than the best-informed prognosticators feared. Back in June a bipartisan group of over 100 political operatives and scholars, gathered by the Election Integrity Project, war-gamed the aftermath of four scenarios: an unclear result, a narrow win for Joe Biden, a clear victory for Mr Trump and the same for Mr Biden. Only in the last simulation was America spared authoritarianism by Mr Trump, a constitutional crisis and street battles.
Mr Biden's actual winning margin was at the outer edge of a ""clear victory. And the president's response to it has been even wilder than the war-gamers envisaged. (They did not imagine, in such an event, that he would try to coerce Republican state legislators to overthrow the results.) Yet none of the other features of the Trump coups they envisioned has materialised. Attorney-General Bill Barr has gone to ground. High-powered conservative lawyers have taken a pass on the president's bogus fraud claims.
Hence the ridiculous Rudy Giuliani, dripping sweat and hair dye and ranting about George Soros and Hugo Chávez, has been the spear-point of Mr Trump's attempted heist. It has been laughable, a shambles. It has also illustrated-yet again-Mr Trump's iron grip on his party, to the extent that most commentators seem to think the Republican nomination for the 2024 election is already his for the taking. They could be right. But Lexington is sceptical.
That is not to deny the president's success in fast-tracking the myth of his stolen re-election to the pantheon of right-wing grievances. The same livid Trump superfans who have been rallying all year against mask-wearing and the scourge of devil-worshipping Democratic paedophiles have gathered, outside state legislatures from Arizona to Pennsylvania, to demand that state lawmakers ""stop the steal. Right-wing conspiracy theorists have been spitting out explanations-involving shadowy Biden-Harris vans crammed with ballots in Nevada, vanishing sharpie signatures in Arizona and so forth-for how the steal took place. A large majority of Republican voters say Mr Biden's victory was illegitimate.
A bigger majority of Republican politicians are afraid to disabuse them. Three weeks after Mr Biden's victory, only a few Republican senators had dared acknowledge it. The damage this has done to their party, and American democracy, could be profound. The next Republican loser to cry fraud will be preaching to the converted. Still, the assumption that Mr Trump will continue to preside over the mess he has made of the right is premature.
There is a reason why Grover Cleveland, in 1892, is the only oneterm president to have been given another crack of the whip by his party. Voters want winners. And it is not obvious why Mr Trump-a politician whose pitch is based on his claimed inability to lose- should be a second exception to that rule. Once the smoke of the 2020 battle has cleared, many of his supporters may see him as he is: a loser whose deranged loss-denialism encapsulates why he ran behind down-ballot Republicans all across the country. There are even signs that one or two of his cheerleaders are already chewing on that pill. ""You announce massive bombshells, then you better have some bombshells..., said Rush Limbaugh, puzzling over Mr Giuliani's performance.
The argument for Mr Trump bucking history rests on an assumption that he will shift his bully-pulpit to the disaggregated conservative media. With Twitter growing less tolerant of his disinformation, his offspring and supporters are migrating to Parler, which takes a laxer view of it. By becoming a staple on the ultraTrumpist oan or Newsmax channels-which Mr Trump recommended his followers switch to after Fox News called the election for Mr Biden-he could access 50m conservative homes. That would constitute a powerful foghorn. But Mr Trump's ability to dictate terms to the Republican Party does not rest on his ability to entertain its voters. It relates to his power to terrorise Republican lawmakers with a possible primary challenge. And it is not clear that, once out of day-to-day politics, he will be able to do that.
oan viewers are divorced from reality in more ways than one. Where Fox's heavyweight newsgathering and polling operations help it to influence the political debate, the hard-right channels are comparatively irrelevant. Almost no one watches Newsmax on Capitol Hill. It is notable that the Tea Party movement, a Trump progenitor, was inspired by an anti-government rant on cnbc. For all his millions of listeners, Mr Limbaugh could not have had the same mobilising effect; such rants are expected of him.
It is not hard to imagine Mr Trump, without the ballast of his office, drifting into a state of lucrative but ever-more irrelevant bloviation. He might not have to resort to singing ""Baby Got Back in a bear costume to get an audience, as Sarah Palin recently did on Fox. But his wilderness years could resemble those of John McCain's embarrassing running-mate more than most commentators imagine. ""There is only so long you can live outside the maelstrom of the American news cycle and maintain relevance, notes Jerry Taylor, founder of the Niskanen Centre and an astute observer of the right. Mr Trump's campaign against the Murdoch channel is probably raising his chances of learning that lesson by the day. It has all the makings of a showdown between machine-tooled corporate competence and his own raging ineptitude.
Dances with bears
It is possible to imagine other scenarios. If the Trump clan captures the Republican National Committee (a prize Donald Trump junior is eyeing), Mr Trump would have a more than adequate platform. Yet take this as a caution. The Trump-bruised commentariat is exaggerating his prospects. When a poll this week suggested 53% of Republicans want him to be their nominee in 2024, it was reported as a testament to his strength. An alternative reading is that almost half of Republicans already want to see the back of him."

CARACAS
The regime will rig December's parliamentary election
""We are going to rescue the National Assembly,"" sing Chucho y Omar Acedo, a pop duo hired by the Venezuelan regime to drum up enthusiasm for the forthcoming parliamentary election. Their catchy ode to the government, broadcast repeatedly on state media, makes it seem simple. ""A future with greatness is arriving ...Happiness and hope are returning,"" the band chants, to a Latin beat.
The first claim is probably correct. The National Assembly is the one branch of government still controlled by the opposition to the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro. In an election due to be held on December 6th the socialist ruling party, the psuv, will dislodge it. The regime has taken steps to ensure that it cannot lose. It has cemented its control over the National Electoral Council (cne).
Pop musicians are not the only means of ensuring that turnout will be high and pro-regime. ""I don't want to vote but I have to because of my work,"" says an employee of the tourism ministry. She intends to cast her ballot for the psuv because she assumes it is not secret and fears losing her job if she shows disloyalty. Most of the opposition is boycotting the election, on the grounds that it will be fixed. A last-ditch attempt by the European Union to delay it by six months to create conditions for a fair election (like having a trustworthy cne) came to nothing.
Although the result is preordained, the vote will matter. The regime's takeover of the National Assembly will be a big step in its march towards full dictatorship. It will strip Juan Guaidó of his job as the legislature's president. As the holder of that office he claims to be Venezuela's rightful president, on the grounds that Mr Maduro won re-election fraudulently in 2018. That claim is recognised by more than 50 countries, including the United States, several large Latin American democracies and nearly all eu members.
Mr Guaidó will lose the speakership just before Joe Biden assumes the presidency of the United States, on January 20th. The new American administration and its partners will have to reconsider their approach to restoring democracy to Venezuela.
The opposition's current hold on the legislature came about by accident. In 2015 Venezuela's ""Bolivarian"" regime, in power for 16 years, was so convinced that it would win the election held that year it did not cheat enough to secure victory. It lost in a landslide, especially in the poor barrios that were once its stronghold. Venezuelans rightly blamed Mr Maduro for a severe recession (which was about to get much worse), high inflation (soon to become hyperinflation) and shortages of basic goods.
The coalition of opposition parties that won control of the legislature should have been able to check the regime. But Mr Maduro, while recognising its victory, ignored its consequences. The puppet supreme court vetoed all the laws passed by the legislature. Eventually, he replaced it with a rubber-stamp Constituent Assembly.
Parliament remained a threat to the regime, especially after Mr Maduro began a second six-year term in 2019. His rigged re- election gave Mr Guaidó constitutional grounds to assume the interim presidency in January of that year. The administration of Donald Trump tightened sanctions, seeking to deny Venezuela income from oil, its main export. The hope was that angry Venezuelans, joined by the armed forces, would switch their loyalties to Mr Guaidó within weeks. Fair national elections would soon follow.
Twenty-one months later the opposition is discredited and divided. The armed forces have not defected. The regime looks entrenched. Some components of the opposition will participate in the legislative election, thinking it is better to have a toehold on power than no purchase at all. Mr Guaidó's allies plan a referendum opposing the vote, to be held mostly online.
Venezuelans are more miserable than ever. American sanctions come on top of years of economic mismanagement by the Bolivarian regime. Since 2017 they have cost the Venezuelan state $17bn-31bn in revenue, estimates the Washington Office on Latin America (wola), a think-tank. That is between a third and a half of this year's shrunken gdp. This year alone the government has had to slash its imports by half, worsening the misery.
The effects are felt by people like Alicia Hernández, a former lawyer from Ciudad Bolívar in southern Venezuela, who walks up to 20km (12 miles) a day to find fuel and food for her children. In the once opulent oil city of Maracaibo on the northern coast residents make home-brew petrol from stolen crude. The exodus of Venezuelans since Mr Maduro became president in 2013 has reached 5m people, a sixth of the population, the largest such movement ever in South America.
Now, despite his catastrophic record in office, he looks forward to untrammelled power. Once the psuv wins the assembly election it will choose one of its own to preside. Mr Guaidó will lose his title on January 5th, when the term of the current legislature ends. His allies deny this. The forthcoming vote ""is not an election"", declares Leopoldo López, Mr Guaidó's mentor, who is in exile in Spain. ""The National Assembly is not being replaced. There will just be a continuation of what is already in place constitutionally.""
In fact, Venezuela's constitution does not spell out what should happen if a legislature's term ends without a duly elected successor. ""There's far from a consensus on this issue among constitutional scholars in Venezuela,"" says Geoff Ramsey of wola.
The main risk for Mr Guaidó is that doubt over his claim to the interim presidency will erode his international backing. Mr Ramsey expects ""a sort of slow walk away"" from support. European ""backsliders"" are looking for a way to distance themselves from Mr Guaidó, grumble diplomats who represent more hawkish governments in Caracas. Among them are Spain and Portugal, which are uneasy about continuing to recognise an interim president who has no power nor much prospect of winning it.
Mr Trump, who will still be in office on January 5th, is unlikely to waver. His backing of Mr Guaidó helped him win Florida in the United States' presidential election. Mr Biden, who won that election, will adjust American policy. He has called Mr Maduro ""a dictator, plain and simple"" and expressed support for Mr Guaidó. But the president-elect has also rejected the idea of engineering regime change.
The Biden presidency is expected to focus its diplomacy on countries such as Turkey and China that continue to do business with Mr Maduro's regime, thereby propping it up. They would seek ways to alleviate the humanitarian crisis while pushing Mr Maduro to negotiate seriously with the opposition on restoring democracy. Mr Biden is thought to favour modifying sanctions to lessen the pain felt by ordinary Venezuelans.
But democracy would mean the demise of the regime, which is not in its plans. It is ""incapable of negotiating"", fumed a European diplomat in Caracas after the abortive effort to delay the legislative election. Changing Mr Maduro's mind will require pressure from his friends. For now, he is bent on ""rescuing"" the National Assembly. Bringing ""happiness and hope"" to Venezuelans is another matter. *"

The blessed and cursed life of an Argentine icon
HE WILL LIVE forever on that sunny June afternoon in 1986 in the Aztec stadium in Mexico City. It was the quarter-final of the World Cup between Argentina and England. In the 55th minute Diego Armando Maradona collected the ball in the Argentine half and carved his way through the England defence as if it wasn't there before striking a low hard shot. It was one of the greatest goals of all time. It came just four minutes after Maradona, with the match scoreless, had risen to meet a miscued clearance in the England penalty area and punched the ball into the net. He had scored, he said later, ""a bit with the head and a bit with the hand of God"". With no video refereeing back then, the goal stood. It was, he said, a kind of revenge for Argentina's defeat at English hands in the Falklands (Malvinas) war four years earlier.
Between them, those goals summed up Mr Maradona, who died of a heart attack aged 60 on November 25th. Blessed with divine talent, he had little respect for the rules in a life that offered riches but which was always a struggle. He embodied the idiosyncrasy of his country, as Clarín, an Argentine newspaper, noted: ""Maradona is the two mirrors, that in which it's a pleasure to regard ourselves and that which shames us.""
The son of a maid and a factory worker, he grew up in a tin-and-cardboard shack in Villa Fiorito, in the rustbelt suburbs of Buenos Aires. As an adult he stood five feet, five inches, but his stocky body and muscular legs gave him explosive power. His trademarks would be surging runs, the ball glued to his feet, and instinctive vision.
His professional career began when he was 15 at Argentinos Juniors, a historic but modest club. Success there took him to Boca Juniors and then to Barcelona and Napoli. But he found fame and fortune hard to handle. He craved affection. Nightclubbing in the company of freeloaders and gangsters led to cocaine addiction. There were many women, some of whom he beat, and enough children to form a football team.
The second half of Mr Maradona's life was tragically grotesque. Obese and often in pain (referees were less protective in his day), he made pathetic attempts at comebacks. He failed as a manager, notably of Argentina's national team. Made rich by capitalism, he saw no contradiction in friendships with anti-capitalists Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez.
Whether Mr Maradona was the greatestever player, ahead of his compatriot, Leo Messi, or Brazil's Pelé, is a debate there is no need to resolve. With his humble origins, Guaraní blood and mop of dark curls, for Argentines he was ever the pibe de oro, the golden boy. ""You made us immensely happy,"" said Alberto Fernández, Argentina's president, as he declared three days of national mourning."

THIS HAS been a bad month for Brazil's populist president, Jair Bolsonaro. First, Donald Trump, whose victory in 2016 served as a template for his own and with whom he aligned his government, lost his bid for a second term. And then the candidates Mr Bolsonaro backed in municipal elections on November 15th nearly all fared poorly, while the big winners were mainstream parties. Some pundits are rushing to write his political obituary. ""The elections of 2018 were a hiatus and those of 2020 have put things back in their right place,"" wrote Eliane Cantanhede, the political columnist of O Estado de S. Paulo, a newspaper.
Brazilian liberals hope she is right, and that Mr Trump's defeat will be an augury of Mr Bolsonaro's fate at the next election in 2022. A former army captain, Mr Bolsonaro is scornful of democracy and its checks and balances, has stuffed his government with military men, says offensive things about gay, feminist and black Brazilians, favours gun ownership and underplays both covid-19 and climate change. His election broke the mould of Brazilian politics and was in some ways an aberration. Even so, it would be a mistake to write off his chances of a second term.
In 2018 Mr Bolsonaro was the beneficiary of an unusual moment in which the country's political class was widely seen to have failed. His chief opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a once idolised former president, was in jail, barred from running by a conviction for bribe-taking in the so-called Lava Jato (Car Wash) scandal. Lula's left-wing Workers' Party was seen by many not just as corrupt and self-serving but incompetent, having driven the economy into what was then its deepest recession in a century. But the opprobrium extended to centrist politicians, many of whom were caught up in Lava Jato.
Mr Bolsonaro, who posed as an antipolitical outsider, tapped into conservative currents in Brazilian society, some long present, some newer. He attracted disproportionate support from men and evangelical Protestants. But what tipped the election to him was the popularity of his talk about family values and law and order in the poor peripheries of Brazil's big cities, the Workers' Party's former base, argues a recent book by Jairo Nicolau, a political scientist. His victory owed much to the skilful use of social media in a way that was novel in a Brazilian election.
As president, Mr Bolsonaro empowered hard-right ideologues, pursued polarisation and all but self-destructed. Six months ago, amid rising tension caused by the pandemic, corruption allegations against one of his sons and threats of impeachment, he came close to ordering the armed forces to shut down the Supreme Court. Some of his military advisers talked him out of that. Mr Bolsonaro saved his presidency by edging away from antipolitics and towards conservative politics as usual, allying with the centrāo (big centre), a clutch of conservative parties of professional politicians who hold 221 of the 513 seats in Congress. An emergency stipend paid to 66m people has blunted criticism of his mishandling of the pandemic. Brazil has had more than 6m confirmed cases and 170,000 deaths. Mr Bolsonaro's approval rating has risen from 30% to 40%.
His most likely path to a second term involves cementing his alliance with the centrāo, which did well in the municipal elections. His attempts to set up his own political party, announced a year ago, have yet to bear fruit. An alliance with the centrāo would make him a much less credible campaigner against corruption and the political class. But it would offer the kind of political machine that historically helped to win Brazilian elections-useful since social media alone are unlikely to give him such a competitive edge twice. If the opposition remains divided both between left and centre and within those camps, that would help him, too.
The big problem for Mr Bolsonaro is the economy. The emergency stipend has helped the country avoid a deeper recession. But how long can the government sustain it? Public debt is heading for 100% of gdp. Even with interest rates low, that is a big number for a country with a history of default and inflation. Economic recovery may be slow and austerity looks unavoidable next year. Income per person has already fallen below its level of 2010. Many Brazilians are suffering. Nationalist sound and fury will not pay the bills. Mr Bolsonaro remains today a competitive candidate. But by 2022 Brazilians may be less receptive to him than they were in 2018."

BEIRUT
The Trump administration has little to show for four years of economic warfare against Iran and its allies
Perhaps he should have done a bit more shopping on his last trip to New York. Last autumn Gebran Bassil, the head of a Christian party in Lebanon, was his country's foreign minister and aspired to be its next president. On a trip to America in September he visited West Point, a military college, where he decried the corruption that has bankrupted Lebanon. Mr Bassil may be unable to return-because America has blacklisted him for his own alleged corruption.
The sanctions announced on November 6th against Mr Bassil were Donald Trump's highest-profile move against a Lebanese politician. Yet it is not clear what his administration hoped it would achieve, beyond complicating efforts to form a new Lebanese government in the aftermath of the huge explosion at Beirut's port in August. Officials have offered contradictory rationales for the move, which illustrates the incoherence in America's sanctionsheavy foreign policy.
In Mr Trump's first three years the Treasury Department added an average of 1,070 names a year to its main sanctions list (see chart on next page), compared with 533 under Barack Obama and 435 under George Bush. More than 20% of the 8,600 entries on the list are linked to Iran and the four Arab countries where it wields the most influence: Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.
""Maximum pressure"", as Mr Trump calls it, has been a tactical success. In April Iran's oil exports dipped as low as 70,000 barrels per day, compared with 2.5m two years before. (Exact numbers are elusive because much of Iran's oil trade is now done in secret.) The rial, Iran's currency, has lost 85% of its value. Yet economic pain has not brought political change. Sanctions have not compelled Iran to halt its support for militias nor convinced Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator, to stop bombing his people. Sanctions may be an alluring tool for presidents. They are inexpensive, bloodless and largely up to executive discretion. But they often do not work.
Sanctions can be effective when they have broad international support, achievable demands and are targeted at firms and people that need to trade and travel. A multilateral embargo on Iran led to the deal in 2015 that restricted its nuclear programme. Sanctions on Rusal, a Russian aluminium giant, forced a Kremlin-backed oligarch to surrender control of the firm.
Mr Trump's maximum-pressure campaign, however, fulfils none of these criteria. For a start, many of his sanctions are unilateral, and some have begun to fray. Iran's oil exports have climbed from their nadir in April, perhaps to as high as 1m barrels a day this autumn, as some countries (particularly China) have defied American threats and snapped up discounted crude.
In its final weeks the administration is debating whether to label the Houthis, an Iranian-backed Shia militia in Yemen, as a 1 ? terrorist organisation. Such designations are meant to cut off funding. But the Houthis have few legitimate sources of revenue to block, since most of their cash comes from smuggling and extortion in Yemen. Their leaders tend not to buy condos in Miami or invest in Wall Street.
If they would be no more than symbolic for the Houthis, sanctions could have consequences for other Yemenis. Some 80% of the country's 30m people rely on aid. Since the Houthis control a large swathe of Yemen, aid agencies must deal with them to distribute food and health care. Sanctions would make this harder.
Mr Assad blames sanctions for the lack of progress in rebuilding his shattered country. It is a risible complaint: the main obstacle to foreign investment in Syria is a regime that bombs hospitals and gasses civilians. Still, sanctions undeniably have an effect. To escape the vice, Mr Assad must end attacks on civilians, release prisoners, and hold officials accountable for war crimes. Having won a battlefield victory against rebel groups, though, he is unlikely to agree-particularly to the last demand, which would require him to put members of his own regime in the dock.
Some diplomats argue that this is fine. ""You break it, you buy it,"" says one, insisting that the West should not help rebuild a country Mr Assad chose to destroy. But this means sanctions are strictly punitive: that economic pain is an end rather than a means. And Mr Trump has been selective about whom he chooses to punish. He refuses to impose legally mandated sanctions on Turkey, for example, because of its purchase of Russian missiles. Nor has he penalised allies with ghastly human-rights records, such as Egypt, which this month detained three prominent activists.
The sanctions on Mr Bassil are instructive. Few Lebanese were upset about the decision. Seen as haughty and entitled-his father-in-law is the president-Mr Bassil was a butt of popular anger during mass protests last year. The American charge sheet against him cites allegations of corruption from his time as energy minister. (He denies them.)
Yet he is hardly the only Lebanese politician accused of graft; looting the state is a policy on which the leaders of most of Lebanon's factions agree. To date America has gone only after officials linked to Hizbullah, the Shia militia-cum-political party. A top official dismisses talk of imposing sanctions on ""our guys"". Dorothy Shea, America's ambassador to Lebanon, says Mr Bassil offered to ""break with Hizbullah, on certain conditions"". The subtext seemed to be that corrupt politicians are only problematic if they pick the wrong partners.
Defenders of Mr Trump's policy insist that it simply needs more time to work, an argument that is impossible to disprove. Mr Trump leaves office with Iran's influence undiminished and its nuclear programme accelerated. Sanctions can be a useful foreign-policy tool. But they cannot be the only one. *"

JERUSALEM
Israel and Saudi Arabia send a clear signal to Iran-and Joe Biden
Israeli ministers were told at the last moment that a cabinet meeting scheduled for November 22nd had been postponed. Not said was that the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was making his way to the airport where he was met by the chief of the Mossad spy agency, Yossi Cohen, who also functions as his plenipotentiary to countries with which Israel does not have official relations. As night fell they flew due south, over the Red Sea, to Saudi Arabia.
Sharp-eyed journalists noticed the unusual flight on an online flight-tracking website and quickly put two and two together: Mike Pompeo, America's secretary of state, was also in the kingdom, meeting Muhammad bin Salman, the powerful crown prince, in Neom, a new high-tech city that the prince is building. Unusually, calls to Mr Netanyahu's office to confirm reports that all three men had met were not rebuffed with denials. Equally surprising was the lack of action by Israel's military censors, who in the past had quashed reports of Israeli-Saudi co-operation. One of Mr Netanyahu's aides snidely tweeted that unlike his defence minister and rival, Benny Gantz, ""who is making politics"", Mr Netanyahu ""is making peace"". Saudi officials have also confirmed the meeting between Mr Netanyahu and Prince Muhammad, reports the Wall Street Journal.
The two reportedly talked about Iran as well as about establishing diplomatic ties. Yet unlike the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which recently ""normalised"" relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia is not ready to open an embassy in the Jewish state. King Salman bin Abdulaziz has long supported Palestinian demands for an independent state in territories captured by Israel in 1967 and the principles of the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. This policy, which exhorts members of the Arab League not to establish normal relations with Israel until it withdraws from all occupied territories, is unlikely to change while King Salman is alive. As a sign of the tension within the Saudi royal family over relations with Israel, the Saudi foreign minister belatedly denied that any such meeting had occurred.
And although neither side has offered official confirmation, both seem happy enough that the news has leaked out because of two key messages it sends. The first is a warning to Iran: as it steps up its nuclear activities, the regional alliance against it is becoming bolder. In mid-November the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium was 12 times bigger than the limit set by a nuclear accord it agreed to in 2015 (and from which America withdrew in 2018). Israel has in the past threatened to bomb Iran's nuclear sites if it comes close to building a nuclear weapon.
The second message the meeting sends is to America and the incoming administration of Joe Biden. When Donald Trump took over the presidency, much of his policy in the Middle East seemed focused on unwinding the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama, whose administration had struck the nuclear accord with Iran and several other powers. Mr Trump tore up the deal and reimposed economic sanctions that had been lifted under it. His administration has also abandoned a long-standing American policy of acting as an impartial peacemaker between Israel and the Palestinians, saying it would recognise Israel's annexation of conquered territories. The Trump administration has also delighted Saudi Arabia with its tough stance on Iran and its indulgence of Saudi humanrights abuses, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled journalist.
This may be about to change under Mr Biden, who has called the Saudi regime a ""pariah"" and threatened to halt arms sales. He has also promised to restart diplomacy with Iran and renegotiate the nuclear deal.
Israel and the Saudis seem to have put the president-elect on notice that they intend to pool their considerable diplomatic and political capital in Washington to oppose major changes in America's Middle East policy. That is something of an achievement for a meeting that, officially at least, never took place. *"

KAMPALA
The state shoots scores dead in the capital's worst violence for a decade
AMOS SSEGAWA was a 15-year-old school-boy walking past a shop with his mother. John Kittobe was a retired accountant on a trip downtown. Sophie Kusasira was selling food in a market. All were shot dead by Ugandan security forces on November 18th and 19th, along with scores of others, in the worst violence seen in Kampala, the country's capital, for a decade.
Unrest broke out after the arrest of Bobi Wine, a popstar-turned-politician who is the opposition's most popular candidate in presidential elections scheduled for January. He draws crowds far larger than the 200-person limit set to contain covid-19. The singer was in Luuka district on November 18th when police bundled him into a van. He was not seen again until a court released him on bail two days later, after he had been charged with ""doing an act likely to spread infection of disease"".
In the meantime young men in Kampala and other cities blocked roads with rocks and burning tyres. Police, soldiers and plain-clothes gunmen swarmed onto the streets, firing tear-gas and bullets. The police say that 45 people died in two days of violence, but the number is probably higher. By comparison, the country has registered 191 covid-19 deaths in eight months.
Firing blind
Supporters of Yoweri Museveni, the president since 1986, were quick to condemn the ""hooliganism"" of protesters, some of whom smashed car windows, threatened passers-by and attacked police officers. Elly Tumwine, the security minister, declared that ""police have a right to shoot you and kill you if you reach a certain level of violence."" But multiple accounts tell of reckless state force. Eyewitnesses say that Mwanje Sudi, a mechanic, was shot dead while sheltering in a yard; a bullet hole can be seen in the gate where he was hiding. Christine Zzawedde, a 58-year-old grandmother, was standing in her back garden when an errant bullet hit her out of the blue. ""She was a very humble person, very loving, very accommodating,"" says her daughter, in tears.
Ugandans have witnessed such episodes before. In 2009 security forces killed at least 40 people in riots sparked by a dispute over the traditional Buganda kingdom. In 2011 at least nine bystanders were shot dead during protests against inflation and bad governance. Even so, the scale of this month's protests took the state by surprise. Mr Wine inherits a long tradition of discontent, yet he differs from other leaders: the young people in Kampala's ""ghettos"" see him as one of their own.
The battle for the streets matters. Many in the opposition deem it their best hope of gaining power. The protesters have shown they can paralyse the capital for a day or two, but their strategy ultimately relies on the police and army deciding not to shoot.
For the moment, the security agencies are loyal to the president. Their chiefs are too busy bickering with each other to turn on him. The middle classes have not taken to the streets, as they did in Sudan against President Omar al-Bashir. ""An officer would rather maim some errant wananchi (ordinary people) and get a slap on the wrist than refuse an order from above,"" says Su Muhereza, a political analyst.
The watchful president has concentrated power among those closest to him. His brother, Salim Saleh, a general, acts as an all-purpose fixer. His wife, Janet Museveni, the education minister, has influential networks of her own. His son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, led an elite army unit until 2017, when he was appointed a presidential adviser; many think he is being groomed for the top job.
Mr Museveni will almost certainly win the election, despite the bloodshed-or perhaps because of it. Maria, a chickenseller in Kampala, worries that Mr Wine's supporters are ""bringing problems"" with ""their chaos"": her own cousin is in a cell after being caught with a tyre and a box of matches. Many others fear that Mr Museveni will only leave office violently, so will vote for him in order to have a quiet life. The old soldier promises order, as long as he is in charge. It is the logic of a protection racket. And one day it will break."

A row over banknotes shows up ethnic and religious divisions
Malcolm omirhobo is no stranger to the Federal High Court in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital. A human-rights lawyer, he is well-known for filing suits against the government, including one for not releasing his ten-year-old son's exam results. His latest case has created an especially loud buzz. He is arguing that Arabic script (known as Ajami when used to write non-Arabic languages) on certain Nigerian banknotes violates the country's secular constitution. He wants it removed. He may also petition the army to delete an invocation in Arabic on its flag.
With perhaps 200m people and 350plus languages and ethnic groups, Nigeria is a mosaic of cultures. A century ago the British amalgamated the three biggest groups under one administration-HausaFulani in the mainly Muslim north, Yoruba and Igbo in the mainly Christian south- despite each having its own traditions and history. Ethnicity and religion have often clashed, especially in Nigeria's central area, known as the Middle Belt.
Ajami and other Arab influences have long stirred up arguments over Nigeria's identity. In the early 2000s a dozen northern states imposed sharia (Islamic law). In 2007 the central bank replaced Ajami with Roman letters on lower-denomination notes of the naira, Nigeria's currency. It said it was trying to foster national unity by upholding the spirit of the constitution of 1999, which bans the establishment of a state religion and the use of any language in parliament except English, Hausa, Igbo or Yoruba. In 2014 Nigeria's then president, Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner, did the same with a new 100-naira banknote.
Many northerners were cross. Ajami is a modified Arabic script used for writing Hausa, just as the Roman alphabet is used for English, explains Mustapha Kurfi, an Ajami scholar. For centuries it has been used across Africa for writing Swahili in the east, Mandinka in the west and Yoruba in what is now Nigeria. In northern Nigeria it is used in everyday life. On naira notes it is understood by ""the old woman in my village"" who cannot read English, explains Aliyu Ibrahim Gebi, a former lawmaker from Bauchi state, in the north-east.
Many Christians, by contrast, fear what they deem to be ""Islamisation"". They mutter that President Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim, previously endorsed sharia. Many Christians complain that key cabinet posts are filled by northerners: all 36 states are equally represented in cabinet, but not all posts have equal clout.
Equally, many northerners see southerners as ""educated but ignorant"", says a Nigerian-born academic. On both sides, conspiracy theories are rife. Even educated people often believe that Boko Haram, the jihadist group that has ravaged the northeast, has been bankrolled by shadowy elites-northern or southern.
Bad governance makes matters worse. Divisions widen when leadership is weak, says Jacob Olupona, a Nigerian professor at Harvard. ""Buhari is not able to manage Nigeria justly,"" he says. ""This is why things are getting out of hand."" Mistrust of government turns many Nigerians to religious fundamentalism. The rising popularity of Pentecostal churches and of mosques that preach extreme versions of Islam deepens mutual suspicion.
Most Nigerians agree that their country is better together, though many Igbos, whose bid for secession led to a catastrophic war in the late 1960s, may hanker after greater autonomy. ""I think the ties that bind us are very strong,"" says Ebenezer Obadare of the University of Kansas, the author of ""Pentecostal Republic"". Gimba Kakanda, who has also written about ethnicity and religion, argues that national ties still need strengthening: ""We need to understand one another, to know each other."" Mr Omirhobo's case is probably going nowhere. But the argument behind it is far from over."

MBOUR
Desperate to reach the Canary Islands, hundreds of migrants are dying at sea
In the dead of night Abdou Aziz Thiaw and Malick Niang, two brothers, recently squeezed into a battered wooden boat in Mbour, a fishing town in Senegal. Along with some 50 others they hoped to evade police patrol boats and survive the voyage of 1,500km to the Spanish Canary Islands- and, once there, to go on to Europe. Weeks later their mother, Amimarr, got a call. Abdou Aziz had made it. But-her voice falters-Malick died at sea. ""No mother in the world wants to see her sons go through that ordeal,"" she whispers. ""But we must not stop them. There is no alternative.""
This year at least 529 migrants are known to have died trying to reach the Canary Islands from Africa. Almost 400 more, in nine missing boats, are presumed dead. The true total is probably higher still. Migrants are casting off in boats along the whole coast, from Morocco to Guinea (see map). The risk of dying on the Canarian route may be six times higher than making the shorter trip to Europe across the Mediterranean. Despite such danger, more than 18,000 migrants have arrived in the Canary Islands this year, ten times more than in the comparable period last year. About 9,000 have arrived in the past 30 days.
Some are fleeing terror. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (unhcr) reckons that up to mid-October almost 30% of those crossing were from Mali, a country beset by jihadist violence. In the comparable period last year Malians were only a tenth of the total. People from Guinea and Ivory Coast, both hit recently by election-related violence, account for another 14% of arrivals, says the unhcr. But since mid-October arrivals from Senegal and Morocco have shot up, too.
Most Senegalese migrants leave in the hope of finding a job and sending money back home. ""Barça ou barzakh,"" they tell each other: ""Barcelona or death."" Many are fishermen, like Amimarr's boys. Moussa Sall, a fisherman in Mbour, says that five years ago he could fill two big boxes with the fish he caught in a day. ""Today it's not even certain I will get half a box,"" he says.
At least half of west Africa's main fisheries are overexploited and illegal fishing is widespread. Yet Senegal's government has renewed a fishing agreement with the eu, which lets 45 powerful European vessels fish for tuna and hake in Senegalese waters. The eu wants Senegal's fish but not its migrants, says Greenpeace, an environmental ngo.
Covid-19, too, has made things worse for fishermen, many of whom were restricted to working only three days a week. The virus has generally clobbered west African economies, so other jobs are scarcer, too. And some migrants erroneously think that deaths from covid-19 in Europe will have opened new employment opportunities there. Border closures in north Africa and tougher European anti-migration measures along the coast have made the Mediterranean route harder.
In the Canary Islands thousands of migrants have been sleeping on the wharf in the town of Arguineguín. The authorities have put more than 5,000 migrants into hotels and is building a tent city for 6,450 people. The Spanish government has largely refused to have them transferred to the mainland for processing. Some Canarians fear that their islands may be turned into an open-air prison.
To stop the influx, the Spanish government says it is planning to more than double the number of boats and aircraft patrolling the west African coast-and to bump up the rate of repatriation flights, which were halted because of the virus. This month one once again left the Canary Islands for Mauritania. In recent years almost all such flights from the islands were to the country, even though few of the migrants were from it. This is because Spain has an agreement that allows it to send to Mauritania nationals of any country if they are ""presumed""-a flexible term-to have passed through it.
On a road to nowhere
Most of the migrants flown to Mauritania are then promptly bused to the border of Senegal or Mali and dumped there. This may break international law. The unhcr has urged countries not to send refugees from many parts of Mali back because it is unsafe. In some cases, says Laura Lungarotti of the International Organisation for Migration, migrants who wanted to request asylum in Spain have been deported without being given a chance to do so.
Senegal, by contrast, has received no repatriation flights from the Canaries since 2018, according to Frontex, the eu's border agency. The migration issue is politically sensitive. The government in Dakar, Senegal's capital, is nervous about the prospect of boat people being forcibly returned. Protests are mounting in Senegal against the government's perceived silence about the hundreds who have drowned. Yet European governments are frustrated because only 8% of Senegalese migrants who have been ordered to leave Europe have actually been returned to Senegal. Spanish ministers have recently visited Senegal and Morocco to persuade the governments of those countries to let repatriation flights resume-and to try harder to stop the migrants from setting off in the first place.
That will be hard. Many migrants are still prepared to risk death for a better life in Europe. ""I want to leave to earn a living to look after my mama-to show her the love I have for her,"" says Beytir, a 31-year-old fisherman in Mbour who has tried the journey twice-and is thinking of trying again. *"

GWACHEON
A push to make prosecutors less political is having the opposite effect
THE IMAGERY is funereal. The slogans attached to the sides of the vans outside the Ministry of Justice are framed in black, like pictures of someone recently deceased. They read, ""Democracy is dead"" and ""The Ministry of Justice is dead."" The dozens of funeral wreaths made of white and yellow plastic flowers that have been laid against the building's fence also carry messages. One addresses the president: ""Moon Jae-in, you're going to die."" The majority express wrath for the justice minister: ""Choo Mi-ae, you bitch."" Funeral music wails from speakers mounted on the vans.
The protest, organised by a right-wing group which insists that the wreaths' message is strictly metaphorical, and an earlier phalanx of flowers left at the prosecution service (pictured above) are rather extreme expressions of support for Yoon Seok-youl, the chief prosecutor, whom Ms Choo suspended on November 24.th-the first time a justice minister has taken such a step. Among other things, she accuses Mr Yoon of spying on judges hearing cases against her predecessor and of lacking political impartiality. Mr Yoon denies wrongdoing and says he will challenge the ""unjust"" demotion in court. He says the prosecution service is being unfairly targeted by the justice minister. That implies criticism of Mr Moon, who has made reforming it one of his political priorities.
The life-and-death rhetoric employed by both sides may be overblown, but Mr Moon is locked in a ferocious dispute with prosecutors. He says he wants to stop both the frequent manipulation of prosecutions by the executive and the pursuit of vendettas against government officials by the prosecutors. But rather than ending the tug-of-war, Mr Moon's approach risks intensifying it, with potentially grave consequences for him and his government.
South Korea's prosecutors have the power not just to indict suspects but also to launch investigations, a task more commonly performed by the police in other countries. Under the administrations of Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, Mr Moon's predecessors, they were accused of using their authority to increase their own standing as well as to align themselves with the political aims of the government when it suited them. They were seen as too soft on powerful politicians and businesspeople, and too hard on those whom they or the president of the day regarded as pesky opponents. Both Mr Lee and Ms Park are now serving long prison sentences for corruption which critics say prosecutors did not scrutinise sufficiently during their time in office.
A central aim of Mr Moon's reform of the prosecution service, parts of which passed the National Assembly earlier this year, was to put an end to such abuses by limiting prosecutors' investigative powers. Under the new laws, which took effect in the summer, they are supposed to yield some authority to the police and some to a new agency to investigate government officials and business bigwigs.
Some see an element of hypocrisy in this. Early in his term Mr Moon was focused on breaking the power of big business and remedying the corrupt habits of his predecessor, and made it clear that prosecutors had his support in using their sweeping powers in this effort. ""That has made it harder to implement prosecution reform, which involves taking away some of these powers,"" says Park Myung-lim of Yonsei University.
Mr Moon appointed Mr Yoon to his post because of his reputation as a hard-nosed, independent prosecutor who did not shy away from cases that the government would rather leave untouched: for instance, investigating the national intelligence service while Ms Park was still in office. Mr Yoon says that the president encouraged him to apply the same scrutiny to Mr Moon's own associates. He has done so with gusto, particularly when it comes to the officials working to curb the power of his own agency. Cho Kuk, Ms Choo's predecessor as minister of justice, was forced to resign last year after prosecutors began investigating his family for nepotism and alleged financial irregularities. Ms Choo herself has come under scrutiny for allegedly seeking favourable treatment for her son during his military service.
None of these investigations has resulted in any convictions, prompting accusations from Mr Moon's supporters that, rather than being scrupulously independent, Mr Yoon is using his powers to undermine the president's reforms, perhaps to further his political career or to deflect scrutiny from his own associates. (Mr Yoon's mother-in-law was indicted on charges of fraud on November 24th, following an investigation from which he had to recuse himself.) The government's critics, however, point to Ms Choo's repeated interventions in investigations that could become awkward for the government. They charge that the government is reverting to the tactics of its predecessors, using prosecution reform as a pretext to protect the president's allies. The reform has become ""a shield to cover up whatever misdemeanours Moon's colleagues commit"", asserts Jun Sung-in of Hongik University.
Despite such claims, most South Koreans seem to support the reforms. But the power struggle between Mr Yoon and Ms Choo has done little to turn the prosecution service into a duller, more workaday agency. Mr Park of Yonsei University thinks that Mr Yoon's suspension may convince the entire prosecution service to take their boss's side, which would not only defeat the intention of the reforms, but also potentially paralyse Mr Moon's administration through endless prosecutions. If Ms Choo manages to assert herself, in contrast, the service may revert to doing the government's bidding, says Park Kyung-sin of Korea University Law School.
For Mr Moon himself, the most important question may be whether the situation increases the danger that he will share the fate of his jailed predecessors. So far, not even his fiercest critics have accused the president of crimes that could match theirs. As his term draws to a close, he may nevertheless find himself under growing scrutiny by prosecutors who are miffed at his efforts to curb their power, yet retain enough of it to cause him misery."

JAFFNA
Tamil politics is badly fractured-but the new government may change that
Hanging above the desk of Emmanuel Arnold, the mayor of Jaffna, are images of three Hindu deities, as well as the Buddha, Jesus and the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina. He has to respect all the religions of his city, he explains. Most Sinhalese, the country's biggest ethnic group, are Buddhist; Tamils, who predominate in the north, including Jaffna, tend to be Hindu, and there are also small Christian and Muslim minorities. (Mr Arnold himself is Christian.) The ecumenical display, however, prompted griping from his staff: there is little sense of unity in Jaffna these days, even among the Tamil majority, let alone between religions and ethnicities.
Tamil hopes for an independent homeland were dashed in 2009, when the government defeated the Tamil Tigers, a ruthless separatist insurgency. But many in the north still hanker for autonomy, as promised by amendments to the constitution adopted in 1987 but never fully implemented. Anxieties about majority rule have swelled since the election last year as president of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who as number two in the Ministry of Defence presided over the defeat of the Tigers in a campaign in which many Tamil civilians also died.
For almost 20 years the main standardbearer for Tamils in Sri Lankan politics has been the Tamil National Alliance (tna), a multi-party union led by Mr Arnold's Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (itak). But in elections in August, it slumped from 16 seats in the 225-seat parliament to ten. (Mr Arnold was one of its losing candidates.)
Mathiaparanan Sumanthiran, the tna's spokesman and an mp, blames this ""very serious setback"" on popular disillusionment after the tna failed to strike a deal on autonomy with the previous president, Maithripala Sirisena. The alliance had been instrumental in Mr Sirisena's surprise victory over Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of Gotabaya, in presidential elections in 2015. Yet reconstruction and development of the north after the long civil war was neglected under Mr Sirisena. Equally gallingly, an assembly to draft a new constitution came and went without making a specific proposal. Mr Sirisena began feuding with his prime minister, and most reforms went out of the window. ""We put all our eggs in one basket,"" laments Mr Sumanthiran.
The result has been a fracturing of Tamil politics. Canagasabapathy Wigneswaran, a retired Supreme Court judge who had served as the chief minister of Northern Province, of which Jaffna is the capital, left the tna to form his own party. He won a seat in parliament in August, as did Gajendrakumar Ponnamabalam, another Tamil nationalist who split from itak. Others threw their lot in with the Rajapaksa brothers' party, the Sri Lanka People's Front (slpf), on the basis that it could at least provide funds for development. One of them, Angajan Ramanathan, also won a seat. Velupillai Sivagnam, a provincial councillor with itak who is in his 70s, cannot remember a time when there were so many different Tamil parties.
In his maiden speech in parliament, Mr Wigneswaran demanded self-determination for Tamils, who he insisted were ""the first indigenous inhabitants of this country"", reigniting a long-running and futile argument over whether Sinhalese or Tamils could claim dibs on the island. But that, says Singaravelu Kumaravel, a Tamil activist, is what many Tamils want: representatives who will rail on their behalf.
Many younger Tamils, however, are not interested in the separatist cause. They have no memory of the 26 years of civil war, says Sivasubramaniam Raguram of Jaffna University. They simply hope for better jobs, which draws them to the slpf. Without more energised youngsters, however, he future of the ""liberation struggle"" looks grim, Mr Raguram worries.
Mr Sumanthiran, however, is more optimistic. He suspects that Mr Rajapaksa's government will embrace Sinhalese chauvinism so openly, and pursue such discriminatory policies towards Tamils, that it will inadvertently spur Tamil unity. The new parliament has already adopted several constitutional amendments, and Mr Rajapaksa wants a whole new constitution- but the topic of Tamil autonomy has barely come up. Despite their wildly divergent politics, all 13 Tamil mps signed a letter earlier this month to the president and another of his brothers, Chamal, who is minister for irrigation. It complained about ""colonisation"" in the form of government efforts to promote Sinhalese migration to Tamil areas. It will not be their last complaint."

Public order is shaken by a hand-drawn smiley face
In march an activist named Jolovan Wham stood outside a police station, held up a piece of cardboard with a smiley face drawn on it and got somebody to take a picture. Passers-by, if they noticed at all, might have wondered what he was doing. None reported Mr Wham and his badly drawn emoji to the police-although in retrospect they should have. Indeed, the police themselves remained in the station, apparently oblivious to the dangerous events unfolding outside. But this week the authorities corrected their oversight, charging Mr Wham with holding an illegal public protest.
In Singapore, smiley faces are not as innocent as they seem-at least not in the hands of a hardened criminal like Mr Wham, who has frequently violated the city-state's laws. Take freedom of assembly. Would-be protesters, even if they number no more than one, must first secure permission from the police. Mr Wham did not. (The one spot where it is possible to gather without approval from the authorities, Speakers' Corner, has been closed since March, when many public places were shuttered owing to covid-19.)
Mr Wham says the smiley-face stunt was in support of two young activists who were questioned by police in March for posting online a picture even more subversive than Mr Wham's. They were depicted holding placards which urged the citystate to do more to combat climate change. Mr Wham stands accused of breaching the Public Order Act for the smiley-face incident and another in 2018 in which he held up a sheet of paper calling for defamation charges to be dropped against two journalists who accused government officials of corruption. Mr Wham says he will not plead guilty. If convicted, he may be fined up to S$5,ooo ($3,725) for each offence.
Mr Wham has frequently fallen foul of Singapore's laws in his effort to highlight how ""ridiculous and overbearing"" they are, as he told the New York Times. He has spent two short stints in jail this year, for ""scandalising"" the judiciary by alleging that Malaysia's courts are more independent than Singapore's, and for hosting an online event which the authorities deemed a public assembly. The webinar featured Joshua Wong, a democracy activist who is in legal trouble in Hong Kong.
Last year police in Kazakhstan arrested a protester for the equally alarming act of holding up a blank piece of paper. But the Kazakh authorities do not have the backbone of their Singaporean counterparts: they soon released the man in question without charge. Eugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University, thinks local prosecutors will have an easy time of it. Mr Wham's photos were shot in public places and were intended ""to draw attention to a particular cause"", he notes. ""Those actions get caught under the public-order law."" Alas, the authorities are clearly not cracking down hard enough. Hundreds of Mr Wham's supporters have posted selfies with smiley faces on social media. Call it a crime wave."

The exchange of fire across the line of control in Kashmir has become fiercer
The ""line of control"" (loc) that wends across the rugged valleys of the former princely state of Jammu & Kashmir is something of a bellwether. It marks the spot Indian and Pakistani forces had reached when they agreed on a ceasefire in their war over Kashmir in 1948. If the two countries are getting on relatively well, the mountains are quiet. Soldiers have even been known to meet on the line to exchange sweets and pleasantries on holidays such as Diwali or Eid. When the two countries met on the cricket field, Ajai Shukla, a retired Indian colonel, reminisced in 2013, ""each wicket taken or boundary hit would see intense celebratory gunfire-directed at a nearby, or especially vulnerable, enemy post"". But these days the sweets have gone and the shells are flying in anger.
On November 13th India said that four civilians and five members of the security forces had been killed, and 19 injured, in ""unprovoked"" Pakistani firing across several parts of the loc. Pakistan in turn said that five of its civilians and one soldier were killed in an ""unprovoked and indiscriminate"" Indian attack. Both sides said they had given the other a ""befitting reply"". It followed an earlier flare-up in April, when drone footage released by India's army showed alleged Pakistani ammunition dumps and artillery positions erupting like volcanoes, throwing flaming debris into the cool Himalayan sky.
Though India and Pakistan agreed on an informal ceasefire in 2003, it fell apart a decade later. Since 2018 the number of ceasefire violations recorded by the Indian Army has almost doubled, while Pakistan has documented a 10% jump (the figures differ because violations are defined loosely, including everything from a stray bullet to an artillery barrage). Things have been getting steadily worse: in 2019 the Indian army recorded 3,479 violations; the figure for this year so far is over 3,800.
In many respects, the shelling follows a familiar pattern. Former Indian and Pakistani officials acknowledge privately that both sides deliberately target not only army posts, but also villages. That grim contest puts Pakistan at a disadvantage: it has more villages and farmland close to the loc, and its soldiers are averse to pummelling their co-religionists in the Kashmir valley (they have less compunction about Hindu areas to the south). Pakistan says that 170 civilians have been ""martyred"" and 918 injured since 2017. But the ritual of strike and counterstrike is also evolving. Last year India began pounding targets north of the Pir Panjal mountain range, where villages are closer together and denser, for the first 1 time in years. It also deployed guided missiles, which can destroy bunkers.
""There is no trigger here,"" says Moeed Yusuf, an adviser to Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister. ""I can't see any other reason for this but what is happening internally within India."" Last year India revoked Kashmir's special status, detained local leaders and restricted phone and internet access. Panchayat (village council) elections are planned on November 28th, with tight limits on campaigning.
But General H.S. Panag, who led India's Northern Command in 2006-08, says that artillery flurries-'Diwali fireworks"", as he calls them-break out for a jumble of reasons. Indian officials often accuse Pakistan of trying to distract Indian soldiers and thus enable militants to infiltrate. Several alleged infiltrators have been killed in gunfights this month, and on November 23rd India said it had discovered a freshly-dug 150-metre underground tunnel. But Happymon Jacob, author of ""Line on Fire"", a book on the loc, points out that the statistical relationship between infiltration and skirmishing is weak. Shells are as likely to alert troops as distract them, after all.
Another explanation is that cross-border fire is a form of punishment. General D.S. Hooda, another former head of Northern Command, says that the Loc deteriorated in 2013 after Indian troops faced a wave of improvised bombs, sniper attacks and even beheadings. ""This led to an immediate spike in cross-border firing,"" he says. After a big terrorist attack at Pulwama in the Indian part of Kashmir in 2019, for which a group based in Pakistan claimed responsibility, India grew bolder. ""After Pulwama, the general policy was to pound them everywhere,"" says General Panag."

It is the oldest move in the Communist Party's playbook: to lock a country in the doghouse when it has offended the cosmic order. Yet even by China's standards, the 14 grievances presented to the government of Australia this month are striking in scope and animosity.
The charges include speaking out against Chinese activities in the South China Sea, Xinjiang and Hong Kong; excluding Huawei from 5G telecoms networks; calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of covid-19; passing a law against foreign interference in politics; pressing the state of Victoria to end its involvement in President Xi Jinping's flagship infrastructure initiative; blaming cyber-attacks on China; and accusing Chinese journalists of being state agents. China also griped about Australia's hostile media and think-tanks. Make China the enemy, a Chinese official told an Australian broadcaster, and ""China will be the enemy"".
The hypocrisy is breathtaking. China severely limits foreign investment, expels foreign journalists, takes innocent people hostage as a diplomatic weapon and routinely interferes in other countries' politics. As Richard McGregor of the Lowy Institute in Sydney puts it, any provincial boss in China who tried to run a freelance foreign policy in the manner of the Victorian government would never be heard of again.
Meanwhile, China has all but shed any legal pretence for blocking Australian imports. Yet complaining gets Australia nowhere. Coal-carriers are anchored off the Chinese coast, unable to land their cargoes. Australian wine sits stranded on the quay in Hong Kong. For decades Chinese demand has stoked Australian prosperity. In just weeks China has raised obstacles to 13 products which generate over a third of Australia's total exports to China. Barley, sugar, timber, lobsters and copper ore have all been banned. Wheat is next. Two biggies, iron ore and lng, have been spared, but presumably only because it is hard to find alternatives quickly.
Could Australia have avoided the doghouse? From cyber-attacks to influencing elections, China poses a threat, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, insists Australia's sovereignty is non-negotiable. Yet members of his own Liberal Party as well as the opposition Labor Party think the government's handling of China has, in the words of Allan Behm of the Australia Institute, been ""cack-handed and lacking nuance"". Why, in August, block the Chinese purchase of (Japanese-owned) Lion, a big dairy and drinks company, when the foreign-investment board had already given the nod? And calling alone for a covid-19 inquiry instead of with other countries was inviting Chinese spleen.
Hawkish dynamics within his party are one reason why Mr Morrison has, as Hugh White of the Australian National University puts it, ""gone out of his way to poke China in the eye"". One group of mps, sporting claw-mark stickers on their office windows, calls itself the Wolverines, in homage to trigger-happy American teenagers resisting a Soviet invasion in a cult 1980s film. A member, Senator Eric Abetz, says its anti-China stand is about calling out barbarism: ""That's the Australian ethic-we call a spade a spade."" Yet the antics of members (who include Labor mps) are ""immature, juvenile and destructive"", a foreign-policy expert, Allan Gyngell, recently warned. At one parliamentary hearing Mr Abetz called on Chinese-Australians to denounce the Communist Party.
Still, wariness of China is no longer a fringe activity. In two years the number of Australians who trust China to ""act responsibly in the world"" has plunged from 52% to 23%, according to the Lowy Institute. In this context, Mr Morrison's talk of sovereignty, Mr White argues, has a primal appeal: plucky Oz standing up to a bully. But as American power ebbs and Chinese power is in flood, Australians, Mr White contends, ""have no conception of how to make [their] way"".
The lack of plan, says John Hewson, a former Liberal leader, is all too evident in the government's handling of China. The prime minister needs to get out of the fix without appearing to back down. The small businesses suffering from China's boycott are his party's natural constituency. The departure of President Donald Trump may help: Mr Morrison got special bile from China for hewing close to him. But the gap he needs to close is wide. Six years ago Mr Xi addressed Parliament in Canberra. Today the Australian government cannot even get a phone call answered. Welcome, China seems to be saying, to the new order."

As China's power waxes, the West's study of it is waning. That is worrying
America's president-elect, Joe Biden, says China is his country's ""biggest competitor"". Yet China's centrality in the calculations of foreign-policy experts in Washington and throughout the West is hardly matched by the interest shown in academia. Despite China's efforts to promote interest in the language-and a surge of attention to it in Western schools a few years ago-enthusiasm for China studies at university level remains lacklustre. Fear of China, and restrictions imposed by it, are in part to blame.
In Britain the number of people studying China at university has dipped each year since 2017. Last year it fell by 90 to 1,434, according to the Universities' China Committee in London, which promotes China studies in Britain. In Australia a survey last year of 16 academics involved in China studies suggested a similar trend. One of the scholars said the number of Australians studying Chinese or Chinarelated topics at university had ""obviously decreased"" in the past five years. Another lamented a ""gradual hollowing out"" of China expertise in Australia.
At American universities enrolments in Chinese-language programmes reached 60,000 in 2013. Three years later a follow-up survey found they had fallen by more than 8,000. Students with a serious academic interest in China usually spend time on a campus there. In 2011-12 almost 15,000 Americans did so. By 2018-19 the total number of Americans studying abroad had risen by 20%. But in China their ranks had shrunk by the same proportion, despite an effort by Barack Obama, when he was president, to encourage more American students to go there. This does not bode well for building expertise in a country that is so important to American interests.
There are several reasons why students in the West are lukewarm about focusing attention on China. The first is one that has always plagued this academic field-a high barrier to entry in the form of a language so different from Western tongues, requiring the memorisation of hundreds of characters in order to acquire basic literacy. Those who study Chinese at school often learn only enough to discover just how challenging mastery of the language is.
A related problem is that many native speakers of Mandarin graduate from universities in China and the West with a fluent command of English. In Western businesses, opportunities for work requiring a command of Mandarin may have grown in recent years, but so too has competition for such jobs. People who have grown up in China often have an advantage, not only with language but also in their ability to open doors in China for their employers.
More recently, China's increasingly repressive political climate has become a powerful deterrent to those mulling the subject. Last year King's College London tried to set up an undergraduate degree in Chinese language, but abandoned the plan. The faculty found that demand for an existing degree in Japanese was far higher. ""Peo-1 ? ple are more attracted to Japan culturally- they like the manga, anime and online games,"" says Kerry Brown, the college's professor of China studies. China's soft power is weaker. Its censorship of the internet and other media and the polluted air of its cities put students off, academics say.
After Phil Entwistle, a British former academic, finished his PhD in 2015, he was hired by an Irish university to teach a course on relations between China and Europe. He found that many colleagues with non-China specialisms were horrified by his interest in the place. ""They asked, 'Why do you want to study this really awful regime? We don't want anything to do with China-look at what's going on there.'"" Having lost hope, for the time being, of pursuing any rewarding work on China ""given everything that is going on"", Mr Entwistle now works as a headhunter.
For those who stick at it, studying China is getting ever tougher. Minxin Pei of Claremont McKenna College in California calls it ""the hardest it has been since the end of the Maoist era"". Gone are the relatively open days of the late 1990s and 2000s. After Xi Jinping took over as China's leader in 2012, the country began tightening restrictions on work there by Western academics. Archives and databases in China became harder to access; visas and interviews more difficult to arrange.
In 2018 a survey of China-studies scholars in several Western countries as well as Hong Kong found that, in the previous decade, one-third of them had been denied either entry to China or permission to use its archives. Nearly one-tenth said they had been ""taken to tea""-a common euphemism for being summoned for a warning by Chinese officials. Many academics tell their PhD students that they may be better off moving to another field because of the risks or the difficulty of doing research in China, says Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University.
Some scholars now stay away from China because of the risk of being detained there. Their fears have been heightened by the arrests in 2018 of two Canadians-Michael Kovrig, a political analyst, and Michael Spavor, a businessman. The two men's continuing detention has been interpreted by many Western observers as a sign of growing willingness by China to use flimsy national-security charges against foreigners from countries with which it has quarrels. Academics specialising in sensitive areas such as politics are particularly wary. Iwatani Nobu, a historian of modern China at Hokkaido University, was held for over two months last year on suspicion of spying. According to Japanese media he was accused of buying books in China relating to historical events before the Communist takeover in 1949.
The risks are even greater for Chinaborn academics, who make up a growing share of staff in China-studies departments in the West. Chinese police often treat emigres as Chinese citizens, regardless of any foreign citizenship they may have acquired. That can mean even harsher treatment should they be arrested. Even in the safety of their campuses abroad, they often keep quiet about topics deemed sensitive by China for fear that Chinese officials will harass their relatives in China or ban them from travelling there.
For Western governments and firms, coping with China is an ever more pressing concern. To respond wisely, they need to understand what makes China tick. If there are not enough Sinologists to guide them, they will surely make mistakes. *"

BEIJING
The party frowns on money-worship. A popular dating show glorifies it
Few chínese television programmes command as loyal a fan base as ""If You Are The One"", a matchmaking show now in its tenth year. In its early days, some 50m viewers tuned in to each episode-an audience second only to the evening news bulletin produced by the state broadcaster. Today ""If You Are The One"" is the sixth-most-watched show in China. But this modest dip in its domestic ranking has been offset by gains overseas. Broadcasters in Australia and Malaysia have picked it up. Episodes on YouTube attract millions of views around the world.
Each instalment features a male contestant and 24 prospective female dates. The charismatic moderator, Meng Fei, a former news anchor, invites the bachelorettes to grill the bachelor on any topic they like. The main draw of the show lies in their questions, which often focus on the man's financial standing. In one of the show's first episodes, a female participant famously quipped that she would rather ""cry in a bmw"" than smile on the back of her boyfriend's bicycle. In another one a woman refused to shake a contestant's hand because he made less than 200,000 yuan ($30,400) a month.
Such unabashed hankering after wealth on a programme watched by legions of young Chinese made the Communist Party feel uneasy. Media regulators promptly ordered the show to stop ""showcasing and hyping up money-worship"" on pain of cancellation. The ostensible reason was that glorifying gold-diggers contravened the party's socialist values. Officials, however, may have been concerned about another danger. Chinese men outnumber women, thanks to sex-selective abortion, so many poor males are doomed to remain single. Reminding them that rich blokes have far more romantic options might make them envious-and angry.
These days, female candidates on the programme are no longer allowed to ask male contestants how much they earn or which car they drive. Hobbies from rugby to rap have become the go-to topics of conversation. Yet ""wealth fetishism"" remains an undercurrent, notes Siyu Chen, a Chinese scholar. The questions are just phrased more diplomatically. Bachelors are probed about their jobs rather than their salaries.
Tactfulness is not always observed. In a recent episode one bachelorette asked whether the man was willing to subsidise her monthly rent of 6,800 yuan. Incidents like this often prompt angry (male) viewers to dig up and publish private information about the ""female offender"" on Baidu Tieba, a social-media forum which hosts a fan page for the show containing 16m usergenerated posts. Many female commentators ridicule these ""insecure"" men.
Censors reckon the show could try harder to tone down the money motive. Last year the government published an ""Outline for the Moral Construction of Citizens in the New Era"". It identifies ""money worship"" as a cause of ""moral failure"". In February regulators hinted that dating shows were not helping. But ""If You Are The One"" keeps going. Perhaps officials deem that Mr Meng, the host, has done just enough to restrain his contestants' impulses. Or perhaps the party reckons that crushing the life out of such a popular show could infuriate people. Enraged citizens may be a more unsettling prospect than people lusting for wealth. *"

Four decades after China emerged from Maoist isolation, mystery surrounds some big questions about its rulers' views of the world. Start with a topical one: what are the true feelings of China's leader, President Xi Jinping, towards Western-style shareholder capitalism, with its emphasis on free competition, transparency, separation between ownership and management, and oversight by impartial regulators and courts?
Listen to speeches aimed at foreign audiences, and China is an example to the capitalist world. It is presented as a champion of openness and fair play, defending free trade against populist nationalists who have fantasies of turning back the forces of globalisation. Yet at home Mr Xi spends as much time stressing national self-reliance, urging Chinese firms, officials and scientists to end their country's dependence on foreign technologies.
Fresh confusion was caused when the government abruptly suspended what was expected to be the largest stockmarket flotation in history, early in November. That ipo by Ant, a financialtechnology giant, collapsed after its founder, Jack Ma, publicly grumbled about cautious regulators and small-minded banks. In China, many sensed a warning from the government that even billionaires must defer to the party. On November 12th Mr Xi sent another message. He visited the eastern city of Nantong to hail a local industrialist, Zhang Jian, as a patriotic entrepreneur whose life story, from 1853-1926, should be studied by business bosses. Touring the mansion that Zhang called home, Mr Xi praised the scholar-turned-businessman for building a manufacturing empire, as well as founding schools and China's first museum. When private entrepreneurs get rich they should become wise and socially responsible, Mr Xi said. He instructed that the site become a base for patriotic education.
It is worth listening whenever a secretive regime reveals what it values. On a damp, grey morning this week that hunch took Chaguan to Zhang's gloomy, allegedly ""British-style"" mansion in Nantong, to retrace Mr Xi's steps. Downstairs, he found a delegation of Communist Party members from the Nantong city government. They were filming their own visit for later study. In an antiquefilled room upstairs, a local man, Zhang Yuanxin, did not hesitate when asked what lesson he took away from Mr Xi's praise for patriotic entrepreneurs. A lot of business types think only about money, he explained. Now it is time for them to give back to society.
A retired engineer from a state-owned oil company, Wang Yongjian, gazed at a bronze bust of the mansion's owner. He noted that Zhang had passed imperial examinations with such distinction that, in another age, he could have served alongside an emperor. But instead, watching China's agonies in the late 19th century, the scholar-official plunged into business. Mr Wang compared Zhang to British inventors of the first steam engines and to Henry Ford, a pioneering American carmaker.
In reality, Zhang created little that was really new. Instead he imported and copied British looms, Dutch irrigation systems and Japanese salt-making techniques, in a bid to fight off foreign competitors. Revealingly, the exhibition in Nantong does not conceal any of this. Displays trace the entrepreneur's journey from scholar-official, serene in mandarin's robes, to indignant nationalist. A diary entry records Zhang's anger at a treaty, imposed on China after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war, which allowed foreign firms to open manufacturing plants in the country. Zhang vows to go into industry himself to save China. Another display shows the steamships that he bought to end the shameful domination of Chinese inland waterways by foreign shipping companies. The dizzying list of businesses founded by Zhang includes cotton mills, steel mills, a bakery, a distillery and a bus company. Institutions he founded include libraries, orphanages, a boy's school (motto: ""Honesty, Loyalty, Independence, Hard Work"") and a school for girls (motto: ""Domesticity, Obedience, Thrift, Gentleness""). The exhibition is strikingly incurious about the funding for this empire, beyond faded photographs of supportive officials and images of share certificates. Luckily, Zhang's conglomerate has been thoroughly studied by historians, among them William Goetzmann and Elisabeth Köll. Their paper in 2005 for the National Bureau of Economic Research, ""The History of Corporate Ownership in China: State Patronage, Company Legislation, and the Issue of Control"", describes a cautionary tale.
Serve the state, and the state will keep competition at bay
Government officials asked Zhang to launch his business in 1895 as a guandu shangban, or government-supervised, merchant-managed enterprise. These firms were modelled on Qing dynasty arrangements by which merchants were granted monopolies, for example in salt-trading, in exchange for collecting taxes and making donations to the emperor to pay for military expeditions or disaster relief. Even after China passed a company law in 1904 and Zhang's conglomerate became a stockholding firm, he ran it as a paternalist autocrat. His first company meeting, in 1907, saw minority shareholders protest that donations to build schools should come from his own funds, not the firm's profits. Think of your consciences, Zhang loftily retorted, ignoring them.
Neither fully capitalist nor state-owned, Zhang's business empire was financed by equity capital but existed to serve the country. That gives Zhang enduring appeal for China's leaders. Long before Mr Xi praised him, Mao Zedong called him one of four Chinese industrialists who should never be forgotten. Objectively, Zhang was not such a successful capitalist. Having narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1922, he was removed two years later as the company's head by a consortium of banks. His first external audit had revealed an opaque mess of transfers and loans to ailing subsidiaries. Today, he is a model patriot. Modern Chinese entrepreneurs may draw their own conclusions."

S&Acaron;O PAULO AND SEOUL
The pandemic has prompted questions about high-stakes exams
""My brother thinks I'm crazy,"" says IVAMárcia Ramos, a 53-year-old from Rio de Janeiro. After losing a job in sales a few years ago, Ms Ramos decided to retrain as a lawyer. She and 6m others are now waiting to take the enem, an exam that many Brazilian universities use in their admissions process. The test should have taken place in November. Because of covid-19 it has been postponed until January.
The free test-prep class Ms Ramos attends, run by a youth group, has been less effective since it went online. So she is relieved to have more time to cram. The delay to the enem has, however, led universities to fill more of their spots for the coming academic year using their own entrance exams. This is bad news for poorer students such as Ms Ramos who have less time and money to study for several tests.
School closures have disrupted the education of close to 1.5bn pupils since the start of the year. Governments have been forced to make difficult decisions about whether and how to conduct important exams. These have revived long-running debates about the fairness of high-stakes tests. That could result in changes that last far beyond the pandemic.
Many countries have ploughed ahead with big exams. On December 3rd half a million youngsters will sit South Korea's fearsome matriculation exam. Face-masks are mandatory. Papers will be brought to hospitals for any candidate needing treatment for covid-19. Pupils lost at least five weeks of face-to-face learning when the pandemic closed their classrooms; cram schools closed, too. But one 18-year-old from Seoul does not feel hard done by. When classes were forced online pupils ""talked less and studied more"", she says.
In July some 10m people sat the gaokao, China's school-leavers' exam. The two-day test took place a month late; exam centres set aside quarantine spaces in case candidates developed symptoms while it was happening. Provincial governments in Germany also agreed that their schoolleavers' exams should go ahead, though they account for only a small portion of students' final grades. Spain suffered one of Europe's worst outbreaks and imposed one of its strictest lockdowns. Its university-entrance exam still went ahead, though it covered less material than usual.
Some countries allowed exams to go ahead but with alterations. Italy called off written tests for school-leavers, but allowed an oral examination to proceed. Austria and Hungary did the opposite. In America Advanced Placement exams-optional courses that some teenagers take to impress university admissions officeswent online. The papers were shortened to 45 minutes and covered only material candidates were likely to have studied before they were booted out of their classrooms.
Andreas Schleicher, head of education at the oecd, a club of mostly rich countries, thinks more countries could have held exams safely: ""You don't want people to talk; you don't need them to move around; their desks are quite far apart."" So far it appears that the grades of most pupils who did sit exams this year have been no worse than usual, according to uk naric, a British government agency that keeps track of qualifications in other countries. Candidates in Germany performed a little better.
Some countries, including Britain, France and Ireland, cancelled exams. That had least impact in places where pupils rack up marks before any final tests. Other governments asked teachers to help decide 1 ? students' grades. These were higher than usual, according to data collected by uk naric (see chart). To produce results comparable to the previous year's, Irish moderators would have had to lower 60% of the grades teachers had suggested for finalyear students registered to sit the most difficult papers. They let all but a fifth stand. In France 96% of pupils earned a schoolleaver's certificate, up from 88% in 2019.
Authorities in England were harsher. They lowered 40% of the grades teachers had proposed for А-levels (exams taken at 18). Outrage ensued. Critics pointed out that the approach moderators had taken risked hurting some children from lowachieving schools. The government eventually agreed that the teacher-suggested grades would stand; as a result the share of entries receiving one of the two highest marks has risen from about one-quarter in 2019 to more than one-third this year. Mary Richardson of University College London says the government was ""foolish"" to think it could ""normalise a completely abnormal situation"". Mr Schleicher from the oecd thinks that by both cancelling exams and abandoning all moderation England ended up with ""the worst of all worlds"".
The muddle has revived long-running debates about the value of exams. A few days or hours of testing is a crude way to assess students' performance in courses that have lasted a year or more. Exams disadvantage clever pupils who deal badly with pressure. Relying on them too much can lead to narrow curricula which include only things that can be tested affordably. Time spent teaching youngsters strategies to maximise their exam scores could otherwise be spent learning more useful stuff.
Some psychologists worry that the pressure of exams is raising the risk that vulnerable youngsters will develop mentalhealth problems, early signs of which often appear during adolescence and early adulthood. Exams can also label children as failures, when they had no choice but to attend bad schools. And rich parents often pay for tutoring to boost their offspring's chances.
Yet abandoning exams creates new problems. Continuous assessment means pupils may simply ""learn stuff, get a grade and then forget it"", says Dylan William, a British expert in educational assessment. Coursework can encourage students to tinker endlessly with just a few pieces of work. Junking exams only introduces new kinds of stress if the alternative is that all schoolwork counts towards final grades. Without objective assessments, learners from poor homes are more likely to be judged on their backgrounds than on their actual achievements.
Teachers sometimes show bias when marking pupils' work. A study of 11-yearolds in England compared the grades teachers awarded with scores the same pupils achieved in tests marked blindly. It found that teachers were more likely to give black pupils lower marks than they deserved. According to research published in 2019, some teachers in New York state gave worse marks to essays when they were led to believe the author was fat. Wealthy parents are more likely than poor ones to put pressure on teachers to boost their children's scores. Worries about corruption help explain why exams remain so crucial to education in China and South Korea.
Teachers in Britain tend to under-predict how well clever pupils from poorer backgrounds will perform in exams. In Wales, where results this year were based on teachers' predictions, grades rose across the board, but the difference between the number of rich and poor children receiving the highest marks was wider than usual in several subjects, notes Rhian Barrance at the University of Cardiff.
Revising the system
Some countries had begun making changes before the pandemic hit. Reforms in France mean that from this year schoolleavers are supposed to enter their final exams with 40% of their marks already in the bag; previously everything depended on the tests. A few years ago England moved in the opposite direction by abandoning coursework and reprioritising end-ofcourse exams. In 2019 an admissions scandal forced South Korea's government to say it would review a programme that seeks to make exam scores less critical to university applications. Chinese officials talk endlessly about shaking up the gaokao, but have only tinkered with it.
The pandemic may amplify calls to get rid of exams that some already thought unnecessary. Universities in America traditionally ask applicants to sit the sat or act, tests which are not required by the public school system. This year many universities waived that requirement after many exam sittings were cancelled. This delighted critics of testing, who say the exams advantage richer applicants who can pay for test-prep. About 70% of American universities offering four-year courses now operate ""testoptional"" admissions policies, up from around 45% before the pandemic.
In England the pandemic has raised fresh questions about the future of gcses, a flurry of exams taken by 16-year-olds. These have become less crucial as a result of reforms that require teenagers to stay in some kind of education or training until they are 18. Developing countries have been gradually junking exams they have traditionally used to decide which children may enter secondary school. This year's crisis could speed that up.
But the disruptions of 2020 have made clear that exams are useful. Some teachers' unions in France argue that inflated grades of the sort handed out this summer risk becoming a permanent fixture as a result of the government's efforts to de-emphasise exams. Teachers in England did not enjoy helping decide who should pass or fail, says Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at Exeter University. Many will be pleased when external examiners relieve them of that burden.
How exams should proceed next year remains a pressing question. Many countries that closed schools during the early months of the pandemic have managed to keep them open during later lockdowns. But lots of children are still having to return to stints of remote learning when there are suspicions of infections among their peers. In October secondary-school attendance rates ranged from a little over 60% in some areas of England to more than 90% in others. They are lowest in places that already had lots of poor children. In mid-November education authorities in Wales cancelled school-leavers' exams set for next spring. Politicians said it would be unfair to require youngsters to sit a common exam, given that the pandemic has affected them in different ways.
Sandra Milligan of Melbourne University thinks officials in the Australian state of Victoria have found ""the disaster"" in England helpful in working out ""what not to do"" with their own tests. Final exams are going ahead there, even though pupils have endured long lockdowns. Those who score unusually poorly may have their grades raised using a system similar to one that has long benefited candidates who suffer illness or trauma. Ms Milligan would like to see examinations become less central to Victoria's school system, but opposed those who saw this year's crisis as an opportunity to rush out changes. Half-cocked school reforms risk hurting those ""who can least look after themselves"". *"

How social distancing is changing the business of getting people together
This month Britain's National Exhibition Centre (nec), the country's largest events venue, was due to host shows including Motorcycle Live, Simply Christmas and Cake International. Yet instead of being filled with bikes, toys and Sachertorte, the space has been fitted with 380 hospital beds. Covid-19 has wiped out the planned exhibitions, tipped the nec's management company into restructuring and caused the government to turn one of its halls into an emergency field hospital.
Social-distancing rules have forced all businesses to think hard about how to keep their customers safely apart. But for events companies the rules pose a particular problem, for these firms' purpose is to bring people together. Trade shows and conferences lose their value if those attending cannot mingle. Concerts are no fun alone. And the excitement of a goal, slam dunk or home run is not the same without thousands of fans roaring their support. Although stockmarkets have mostly recouped their losses since January, the market capitalisation of listed ""crowds businesses"" identified by The Economist has sunk from $234bn to $i83bn (see chart 1 on next page).
Some live-events industries are dealing with the crowds problem more easily than others. But as the pandemic grinds on, it looks as if those that have had the hardest time in 2020 will emerge least scathed when things get back to normal-whereas those that have found ways to adapt may find that the temporary fixes cause longlasting disruption.
Hardest hit has been the exhibitions industry, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the crowds sector's market value. According to amr International, a consultancy, its global revenues will contract by twothirds this year, to $9bn (see chart 2). The outlook is so uncertain that amr's analysts have not hazarded an estimate for next year's revenues.
Take the colossal trade-fair centre in Hanover, the size of 60 football pitches. It closed in March and has been empty most of the time since. Deutsche Messe, which runs it, was expecting revenues of €33om ($392m) this year; Andreas Gruchow, a member of its managing board, says that it will end up with about €ioom, partly from events it has run in China, which has controlled covid-19 better than America or Europe. A few events have been held in Hanover, following new rules mandating masks, a reduced headcount and so on. But exhibitors ""expect the whole world to come to Hanover and visit them at their booth"", observes Mr Gruchow; with international travel on hold, the big fairs are not happening. Organisers have dabbled online with limited success. Some exhibitions, like Cake International, are best enjoyed in person. Even the liveliest Zoom panels lack the opportunities for networking that justify many conferences' eye-popping admission price. Exhibitors pay a four- or fivefigure fee for a spot in one of Deutsche Messe's online trade fairs, says Mr Gruchow; for a physical booth at Hanover they would pay up to €300 per square metre, leading to seven-figure bills for the largest participants.
Yet trade fairs' digital clunkiness will protect the industry from disruption. ""You can't 'Amazon' the events business,"" points out Marcus Diebel of JPMorgan Chase, a bank. He cites this as a reason for longterm optimism about the industry. relx, owner of Reed Exhibitions, the world's second-largest exhibitions company by sales, saw its revenues fall by 70% year on year in the first half of 2020, but its share price is down only 8% since January. That of Informa, the largest, has shot up by a third this month, as successful late-stage trials of covid-19 vaccines have been reported.
Organisers agree that future events will have more digital elements. But a dire couple of years are likely to give way to something much like the old normal. amr expects revenues to rebound to 78% of last year's level by 2022.
Pitch-dark
The opposite is true in sport, another crowd-dependent business. After a pause in the spring, most professional leagues have managed to play on, getting round the lack of spectators in novel ways. fc Seoul populated its stadium with mannequins from a sex-toy supplier (and in the process earned a fine from the South Korean football league for indecency). Others have piped in sound, added cardboard cut-outs or cgi spectators. Some have even livestreamed fans' faces onto screens in the stands, as in wwe wrestling's new ""ThunderDome"" in Florida.
Yet the smooth transition disguises disruption that may last. The cost of forgone ticket revenue has been borne unevenly. In the main American leagues teams keep the income from tickets-and the drinks, hot dogs and so on that go with them-whereas leagues get the proceeds of national broadcasting rights. So teams are on the rack. Major League Baseball, with its long season and relatively modest tv deals, is in bigger trouble than the National Football League, which has fewer games and pricier tv rights. The New York Mets, a struggling baseball team that was sold last month, is expected to lose out on nearly $250m in ticket sales this year.
The pandemic has also accelerated changes in how people watch sports at home. The lack of crowds has contributed to a fall in viewership of full games, as fans switch to highlights and new formats. The National Basketball Association (nba) highlights show on Snapchat, a social app, has had 37% more viewers this year, even as American television ratings for the nba finals fell by 49%. People are spending more time on betting sites and forums like Barstool Sports, says Brandon Ross of LightShed Partners, a media-research firm. ""There are millennials and Gen z-ers who would rather just sit and watch the Barstool personalities pontificate...than watch the games themselves,"" he says.
The decline in whole-game viewing bodes ill for the big sports broadcasters. espn, owned by Disney, announced this month that it was cutting 500 jobs amid ""tremendous disruption in how fans consume sports"". Its chairman, Jimmy Pitaro, said the company would now focus on ""serving sports fans in a myriad of new ways""; some written and audio content has gone behind its paywall.
Lower whole-game audiences will translate into lower advertising revenues for broadcasters and, ultimately, lower budgets for rights deals, ""the overwhelming financial engine for sports"", warns Mr Ross. These trends will persist long after covid-19 is defeated.
If the exhibitions industry looks stable and sport is heading for disruption, live music combines both trends. Coronavirus has pulled the plug on concerts. Live Nation, the world's biggest live-entertainment company, reported this month that its revenues plummeted by 95% in the third quarter, compared with a year ago. cts Eventim, a European rival, saw its sales slide by 79% in the first nine months of 2020, year on year.
Rather like the exhibition organisers, however, the big music promoters are protected by investors' faith that mosh pits and muddy festivals are not easily replicable online. Live Nation's and CTS's share prices are down by, respectively, only 10% and 15% since February-not bad for firms that have lost nearly all their revenue.
This suggests that live-music companies can outlive the pandemic. The giants should have no problem. Live Nation has nearly $1bn of cash and the same again in undrawn debt facilities, comfortably enough to see it through to next summer. But many smaller operators will not make it. America's National Independent Venue Association says that 90% of its 2,900 members expect to close permanently without a bail-out. Live Nation will get a chance to sweep them up, entrenching its dominant position.
That does not mean the live-music industry will escape disruption. Early in the pandemic artists, who these days make more money from touring than recording, performed amateurish streaming concerts from makeshift home studios. Online gigs have since become more professional with the help of companies such as Driift and Dice, which organise elaborate streamed productions.
Tickets are much cheaper than those for in-person gigs-entry to an online show this month by Dua Lipa, a British singer, cost €12.99, about a quarter of the minimum that fans used to have to pay to see her in real life. But there is no limit to capacity. And stars can attract concertgoers in places where they would never tour. bts, a South Korean boy band, staged an online concert last month which brought in almost im viewers from i9icountries.
A different tune
There are also glimpses of completely new forms of entertainment. In April Travis Scott, an American rapper, appeared in virtual form in Fortnite, an online video game. Some 28m players attended the free concert as avatars. Experiences such as these are not replacements for in-person live music. But they are the makings of a subindustry that will supplement the incomes of stars with global followings. Covid-19 has dealt live music a severe blow in 2020, but the resulting innovation could help the industry come back stronger-if, perhaps, a bit less crowded. *"

Bertelsmann snaps up Simon & Schuster
In the days before Thanksgiving two top contenders emerged for Simon & Schuster, the fifth-biggest English-language book publisher by revenues, from ViacomcBS, an American media group. On November 25 th Bertelsmann gained the upper hand. With an offer of $2.2bn the German parent of Penguin Random House (prh), the largest publisher by a Tolstoyan margin, outbid News Corp, Rupert Murdoch's media group, whose catalogue contains HarperCollins, ranked third (see chart).
A merger with Simon & Schuster would give prh almost one-third of English-language book sales. That is more than double the market share of its closest rival, Hachette Livre, owned by Lagardėre, an ailing French conglomerate. (Vivendi, a French group that is Lagardėre's biggest shareholder, also briefly vied for Simon & Schuster.) In America the merged biblio-behemoth would control 70% of the market for literary fiction.
Authors and agents worry that the enlarged prh may become ever more dominant in distribution-and that market concentration could lead to an excessive focus on bestsellers such Michelle Obama's memoir of her time as America's first lady (which was published by a prh subsidiary) at the expense of niche titles that are no less worthy. Robert Thomson, News Corp's boss, is certain, for his part, that the Bertelsmann deal will alert trustbusters. Earlier this year America's Department of Justice thwarted a merger of Cengage and McGraw-Hill, two publishers of educational books. Any delay would be bad news for ViacomcBS, which needs the money badly for investments in video-streaming, where it lags behind rivals such as Netflix, Disney or at&t, a telecoms giant that owns hbo.
Thomas Rabe, Bertelsmann's boss, says he is confident that regulators in America and other countries will bless the deal. They rarely block mergers that only reduce the number of big players from five to four. The last big union, Bertelsmann's takeover in 2013 of Penguin, did not fall foul of antitrust guardians. Moreover, the leading five have lost market share in recent years to smaller rivals, not to mention Amazon, which these days not only sells books (as well as just about everything else) but also publishes them.
That still leaves the question of whether the deal is a good one for Bertelsmann. The price was heftier than even ViacomcBS expected. Covid-19 initially hurt book sales, as it did other discretionary spending. ""The first five weeks [of the pandemic] were very tough,"" admits Brian Murray, chief executive of HarperCollins.
But with their pantries full, self-isolators turned to fiction for escapism and edification. ""People are always predicting the decline of book publishing, but it has actually been very resilient,"" says David Steinberger, chief executive of Arcadia Publishing, a publisher of history books.
And Simon & Schuster is a prestigious prize. It was originally set up in 1924 to publish crosswords, but went on to represent Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Tom Wolfe. This year it made waves with the publication of ""Rage"", a ferocious account of Donald Trump's White House by Bob Woodward, a far-famed journalist, as well as a tell-all memoir by the president's niece, a psychologist.
Nabbing Simon & Schuster is Bertelsmann's second coup in the space of a week. On November 17th American and Canadian readers set a record for first-day sales, snapping up 890,000 copies of a new memoir by Mrs Obama's husband, also published by a prh subsidiary. *"

NEW YORK
America's favourite spree isn't what it used to be
Oxford-dictionary lexicologists recently declared ""blursday"" a word of the year. Pandemic-induced date confusion extends beyond self-isolating households. Best Buy, a large American electronics retailer, recently declared that ""Black Friday isn't just one day this year-it's months long.""
The start of the pre-Christmas shopping season, which this year falls on November 27th, has long been a bonanza for American retailers. The term itself is often credited to Philadelphia's policemen, who used it to describe the pandemonium caused by suburban shoppers and tourists thronging the city ahead of the annual Army-Navy American-football game on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. By the 1980s shops recognised the branding opportunity-and began marking the occasion with deep discounts and ""doorbuster"" deals to pull people from their turkey-laden tables to shopping aisles.
These days retailers make one-fifth of their holiday revenue, defined as sales in November and December, in the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, invented in 2005 by the National Retail Federation (nrf), a trade group, in recognition of an online sales bump on the first working day after the holiday weekend. Black Friday typically attracts more than twice the foot traffic of other annual shopping sprees in America.
This year, though, covid-19 has made many shoppers reluctant to elbow their way to cut-price wedding gowns or tv sets. So large retailers have, like Best Buy, stretched Black Friday from a frenzied 24 hours to several weeks. Walmart, Target and other big-box retailers announced discounts on holiday items as early as October 11th. In lieu of mall Santas and mistletoe, they offered refurbished online interfaces, generous return policies and expanded options for kerbside pickup. Amid the pandemic-induced collapse of travel and other ""experiential"" spending, some of the unspent dosh is going on stuff instead, notes Jill Standish of Accenture, a consultancy. nrf expects this year's holiday retail sales to grow by as much as 5% compared with 2019, as friends and families use gifts to show long-distance appreciation.
Even if NRF's forecast proves accurate, however, this year's haul is unlikely to arrest the stagnation of the holiday shopping season. Its share of annual retail sales fad- ed below 19% throughout most of the past decade, from 20.2% in 1992 (see chart). Online shopping offers perpetually low prices, making one-off discounts somewhat less exciting.
In this light, Black Friday's in-store stampedes no longer look that appealing. The day's internet sales have been rising (though Cyber Monday has digitally outshone it since at least 2016). Last year a third of the day's $23bn trade happened online. Now the share could be closer to a half.
In any case, the idea of squeezing all your bargain-hunting into a day is falling out of fashion. Since 2019 Amazon Prime Day, the e-empire's signature shopping event, has lasted 48 hours. And this year Singles' Day, a Chinese extravaganza which normally falls on November 11th, lasted a full 11 days. *"

BOSTON
Social unrest in America has fuelled a boom for a new kind of advice
AS PROTESTS AGAINST police violence and racism convulsed America's streets this summer after the killing by a policeman of George Floyd, a black man, the heat could be felt in the air-conditioned corner offices above. America Inc rushed to announce plans to tackle racial inequality. Walmart said it would set up a $100m initiative to fight racism. Pepsi vowed to double spending with black-owned suppliers. Facebook and Estée Lauder pledged to hire more non-white candidates. JPMorgan Chase promised to extend $30bn in loans over five years to minority households and businesses. Even nascar, which runs a motor-racing series for a mostly rural and white fan base, prohibited the display of confederate flags at its events. Diversity, many said, is not just the right thing to do. It is good for business.
For one breed of firms it has been very good indeed. Consultancies and recruiters are enjoying a mini-boom as companies look for advice on how to become more inclusive. The newly created diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) practice at Bain, a consultancy, now has two dozen staff, and another two dozen want to be part of it at least some of the time, says Julie Coffman, who heads it. She calls diversity ""the next digital"". A partner at another consultancy says dei is the ""fastest growing business line we have right now"". Lyndon Taylor, who leads dei at Heidrick and Struggles, an executive-search firm, discerns a ""quantum"" jump in demand for such services.
Lots of companies promised to do things during the protests. Now, Mr Taylor says, they must work out what those are and how they are going to do them. The priority is hiring black senior executives or board members. Before 2020 diversity meant women, Latino, Asian and lgbtq, says Dale Jones, boss of the Diversified Search Group, a 46-year-old recruitment firm originally set up to promote women. Now Mr Jones sees ""a hyper focus around black leadership"", with board placements up by half and c-suite recruiting by around a third over the past year.
Julie Hembrock Daum, who recruits board members at Spencer Stuart, another search firm, says she has to temper clients' expectations about what is possible. She tells them to think long and hard about what qualities they need on their board rather than ""a knee-jerk reaction like 'we need a ceo who is black'"".
Recruiters remind clients that boardrooms and c-suites are not overly blessed with other ethnic minorities, lgbtq people or women. They also highlight other underrepresented groups, such as veterans, migrants and refugees, the ""differently abled"" and the all-encompassing ""cognitively diverse"" (consultant-speak for people who think differently).
The diversity industry has expanded beyond finding new hires. Consultancies' and recruiters' services include training staff on bias, advice for diversifying supply chains and coaching senior executives on how to run more inclusive firms. Some offer broad-ranging strategies for organisational and managerial changes. As one recruiter puts it, ""hiring can be a quick fix, but you can't just add a couple of diverse fish. You actually need to change the water in the pond.""
Demand for such services is unlikely to abate any time soon. A survey by Edelman, a public-relations firm, conducted soon after news of Floyd's death, found that 60% of respondents said a brand's reaction to the protests ""will influence whether I buy or boycott them in the future"". Younger customers and employees are likelier to hold strong views: 53% of those aged 18-34 said they would not work for a firm that failed to speak out during the protests, compared with 42% for all ages.
The change is driven by the drive and passion of younger employees, says Pamela Warren, who in July was appointed coleader of the dei council at Egon Zehnder, a big executive-search firm. As more of them enter the workforce, pressure on employers to be more representative of the population will grow-and with it demand for the diversity industry's services."

Are online ads being viewed by virtual eyeballs?
IT WAS A spectacular bit of timing. On November 16th Baidu, a Chinese online-search giant, said it would buy yy Live, a China-focused video-streaming service with 40m monthly users, for $3.6bn. Two days later Muddy Waters, an American short-seller, published a report claiming yy Live was ""an ecosystem of mirages"" and ""almost entirely fake"". The share price of joyy, yy Live's parent company, slid by 26%.
Muddy Waters alleges that joyy's platforms, including yy Live, are infested with ""bots""-computers that log on to ""watch"" streams, pretending to be human. Many, it says, appear to sit in joyy's internal networks. The upshot, it alleges, is that somewhere between 73% and 84% of joyy's revenue is suspect.
JOYY responded by saying the report contained ""numerous errors, unsubstantiated statements and misleading conclusions and interpretations"". It said it would be open to ""cash verification and diligence"" conducted by ""competent third-party advisers"", (joyy and Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.)
The allegations are unusual in accusing the platform of creating its own fake users. Technological complexity and minimal human oversight means the ""attention economy"" is full of virtual eyeballs. But such mischief tends to be the work of outsiders. Last year America's Federal Trade Commission fined the boss of a firm called Devumi $2.5m for selling fake YouTube views, the first time such a complaint had been brought. Digital advertisers pay to have their ads shown to users. It is an open secret that many end up served to fake viewers, generated by computers infected with malware written for this purpose.
A new report by the University of Baltimore and cheq, an anti-fraud firm, estimates that $35bn is lost annually to such scams, from a total market worth $333bn. South-East Asian fraudsters employ humans to scoot between racks of smartphones, tapping ads and installing apps, says Gary Danks of Machine, a firm that offers ad-fraud detection. Those in places with higher labour costs simulate phones on computers.
Companies are fighting back. Last year Uber sued more than 100 ad agencies, accusing them of buying fake views on its behalf. Facebook launched a lawsuit against firms it says create malware that hijacks users phones, forcing them to generate fake ad clicks. Neither suit is likely to stem the fraudsters' rise."

TIME FOR a confession. Normally, Bartleby's family waits until December before putting up the Christmas decorations. But this weekend, even though it is only November, the festive lights will go up. Furthermore, he has bought some new (especially gaudy) decorative items to brighten up the front of the house.
Your columnist is far from alone. Some celebrities have already decorated their Christmas trees; Joan Collins, an actress, was pictured next to hers on November 10th. The local coffee shop and minimarket had dressed in fir by mid-November. These early seasonal signals have been triggered by the possibility of a long and depressing winter, in which the pandemic will disrupt traditional celebrations and families may be kept apart. There is the prospect of a vaccine but, for most people, not until the spring.
A recent survey found that 68% of Britons said the pandemic had adversely affected their mental health before the nights started drawing in. In the circumstances, many people will be tempted to put up more Christmas lights just to have a cheerful sight.
The approach of winter is a problem for employers and workers alike. When Western economies endured their first covid-19 lockdown, it was the spring. The days were lengthening and people working from home could take a break from their labours and go for a stroll in the local park. Many could take their laptops and work in the garden (if they were lucky enough to have a backyard, and a job that could be done remotely).
But the second wave of the disease has hit as days get both colder and shorter. Workers are stuck inside for most of the day; in many countries, restaurants and bars are shut. The idea of working from home seems less inviting when there is little scope for taking a break.
To counter the seasonal gloom, humans have long celebrated the winter solstice, the moment when the days start getting longer again. This helps explain why even atheists are enthusiastic participants in Christmas festivities.
The fact that the solstice is followed by the start of a new year only adds to the need to mark the event in some way. In Christian countries these celebrations are a part of people's working lives. At the minimum, this means lights and decorations in the office, or a Christmas tree in reception. Often, it will involve a lunch, after-work drinks or a party for staff, where they can relax and reflect on the year's efforts. The effect is to bolster team spirit.
Look back to the suggestions made by management consultants about improving winter morale in previous years and it is striking how many of them involve collective activities: ice-skating, fitness classes, potluck lunches and the like. Social distancing now rules out pretty much all these distractions.
Online collective activities are a substitute, but not a great one. When the pandemic is over, few people will want to maintain the tradition of ""Zoom drinks"". Quizzes are a potential substitute, although they do not appeal to everyone. Some will be embarrassed if they do not know the state capital of South Carolina or the losing side in the last fifa World Cup final.
The other way companies can boost morale at the year end is with an annual bonus. But the economic damage caused by the pandemic has crimped many businesses' ability to offer this perk; they are struggling hard enough just to keep everyone in their jobs.
That leaves another hardy perennial. Around this time chief executives send out a message to all staff in an attempt to rally the troops by recounting the successes of the previous year. These always remind Bartleby of the scene in the bbc sitcom ""Are You Being Served?"", when a department store's elderly owner tells his shop assistants ""You've all done very well"", before tottering away on the arm of his nurse. It is hard to feel motivated by such bland, indiscriminate praise.
So this year managers need to do a better job. A personal message (or a phone call) to each staff member in their team is a good start. The conversation should contain some praise that is specific to the individual, as well as a check on how the colleagues are feeling at a difficult time. This will be time-consuming-and all the more appreciated for it. The art of management is not merely about hitting a budget.
If this doesn't happen at your company, never mind. Praise from a boss is priceless. For everything else, there is always a display of luminous reindeer."

Back in the 1980s a young Francesco Starace was working in the Saudi desert on a wasteful fossil-fuel project. His task was to build an oil-fired power plant. It was highly inefficient. Even though the country sits on a sea of the stuff, the fuel needed to be transported by lorry hundreds of kilometres across the desert from Jeddah. And to begin with there were no customers; its aim was to provide a way to persuade nomadic tribes to settle down in airconditioned homes. Mr Starace loved the job. Only years later did it strike him how ""crazy"" it was. He tells the story to illustrate that the significance of sustainability did not dawn on him quickly.
Today the 65-year-old is boss of Rome-based Enel, Europe's largest utility. Its market value has more than doubled to €85bn ($ioibn) since he took over in 2014, making it as big as an oil giant. Concerns about climate change are now all the rage among the world's business elite. But few companies match Italy's biggest firm in putting its money where its mouth is. On November 24th Mr Starace unveiled plans to invest €i6obn by 2030 to virtually triple its renewable-energy capacity to 120 gigawatts and transform its grids in Europe and Latin America to prepare for an all-electric future. The announcement came weeks after a similarly striking pledge by Iberdrola, Spain's second-biggest company, to invest €75bn in renewables and grids by 2025. In America NextEra, a pioneering utility which briefly eclipsed ExxonMobil in value of late, has also promised to fork out a fortune on wind and solar.
The triumvirate's spending plans are still dwarfed by the vast sums oil companies pour into fossil fuels every year. But they make three things clear. First, renewables have moved from niche to the big time. Second, utilities, formerly the dowdiest part of the energy universe, are now where the action is. Third, the oil industry has a lot to learn if it wants to invade their patch.
Sitting in his book-lined study on the eve of the announcement, the bespectacled Mr Starace does not fit with the caricature of a gruff utility boss. He wears a black crew-neck sweater. He reads poetry. He drives a Tesla. When he set about selling off Enel's legacy coal-fired power stations in 2015 he wanted them turned into museums and art galleries. He talks about energy with a softspoken enthusiasm more usually found among tech evangelists. When discussing the money that America, Britain and the European Union are promising to invest in clean energy over the next few years, he purrs: ""They finally got it.""
The pandemic, Mr Starace says, has given the world a glimpse of a renewables future. For years it was a matter of hot debate how much intermittent wind and solar power an electricity system could absorb without crashing. Lockdowns, he thinks, have helped settle the argument. They crushed demand, driving out conventional sources of power generation in favour of cheaper renewables, yet systems withstood the shock ""beautifully"". Though gas and coal will bounce back, he believes governments will be reassured that renewables do not pose the dangers that their critics claim. Enel is taking advantage of the political tailwinds. By 2023 it plans to invest €i6.8bn in onshore wind and solar, promising to raise core earnings, or ebitda, by 13%. It still operates coal-fired power plants in Italy but vows to close them down by 2027, three years ahead of schedule. In a dig at the oil industry, it has taken to calling itself a ""renewable supermajor"".
Renewables catch everyone's attention. But Enel also proposes big investments in networks and distribution-the pylons that make up a grid, as well as the poles and wires feeding electricity to customers-which it operates in eight countries. To reinforce and digitise them for a future of clean energy, electric vehicles and mass electrification, Enel plans €i6.2bn of investments in the next three years. It is also open to making acquisitions. Its total spending will be financed by a slight increase in net debt, green bonds and government clean-energy programmes.
The €20bn in annual ebitda Enel is likely to generate as a result marks a ""mind-blowing"" turnaround, says Sam Arie of ubs, a bank. When Mr Starace took over, Enel was debt-ridden and had recently cut the dividend. Yet now it promises a guaranteed payout for the next three years, even as many pandemic-hit companies can scarcely look beyond January. Utility analysts, a nerdy bunch, relish the boldness. ""You have made our job a lot more interesting,"" one from Goldman Sachs, a bank, told Mr Starace.
Oil companies, which once peered down their noses at utilities, now eye them with envy. They have a lot to learn. For all their efforts to repaint themselves green, their ambitions remain a pale shade of it. Enel's promised renewables investments in the next three years almost match those of bp, Royal Dutch Shell and Total combined. The oil majors also lack the right skills. Mr Starace says vertically integrated utilities such as Enel are different from most oil companies chiefly because of their relationships both with regulators and customers. ""The only thing they have in common with us is the word 'energy',"" he quips. And, as Meike Becker of Bernstein, a broker, puts it, oil giants tend to lack utilities' financial discipline. They talk a good game. Utilities, in contrast, like to underpromise and over-deliver.
Dangers lie ahead. Increased competition means Enel is lowering its predicted returns beyond 2023. Its desire to move into India, a minefield of an energy market, may lead it astray. And its zeal to expand could lead to costly bidding wars for networks, such as the one it won in 20i8 against Iberdrola in Brazil's Sāo Paulo state.
Generation change
Mr Starace, recently given a third term as boss, appears as unflappable as ever. He has strong lieutenants who could take over when he retires. He is a model of southern-European business acumen. And he has a smooth Italian charm. ""I'd love him to be the grandfather of my kids,"" coos one investment adviser. Not many utility bosses can claim that as an endorsement. *"

The ECB's boss is taking the bank out of its comfort zone-and into hers
CHRISTINE LAGARDE has been an outsider before. Speaking to The Economist, she relishes the memory of shaking up bureaucrats-""men in grey suits""-when she took over as France's finance minister in 2007. She even installed a ""psychedelic"" carpet in her office, to get them to look up from the floor. Now Ms Lagarde, who then went on to run the imf, is shaking up the idea of what it is to be a top central banker.
The main prerequisite used to be a degree of nerdiness: just think of Janet Yellen, a former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and Joe Biden's choice for treasury secretary (see next story); Ben Bernanke, her predecessor at the Fed; or Mervyn King, a former governor of the Bank of England. All spent decades in academia. By contrast Ms Lagarde, who has been the head of the European Central Bank (ecb) for just over a year, is not an economist but a lawyer and a former executive and politician. She brings a glittering cv and a high public profile to the job, but is probably more comfortable rubbing shoulders with heads of state than participating in a research seminar.
On the face of it, Ms Lagarde and the ecb have had a decent year. The bank has acted decisively, avoiding the mistakes of the financial crisis of 2007-09 and the sovereign-debt woes of 2010-12. Since the start of the year it has injected stimulus of €2.2trn ($2.6trn) into the economy (see chart 1). In contrast with the austerity of a decade ago, fiscal policy is acting in concert with monetary easing, including at the EU-wide level. The new opportunity to help co-ordinate monetary policy and government spending plays to Ms Lagarde's strengths. Yet it is precisely her willingness to venture into areas that most central bankers consider political terrain that is causing some controversy among the experts.
The ECB's ammunition was sorely depleted even before covid-19 struck. Its benchmark deposit rate was -0.5%, and it had been buying government and corporate bonds through its quantitative-easing (qe) scheme since 2015. But the bank warded off a credit crunch earlier this year by ripping up self-imposed rules. Instead of buying a country's assets in rough proportion to the size of its gdp, it has bought more of those of Italy and Spain. The ecb has also expanded the generosity of its long-term loans to banks, paying them up to 1% if they continue to lend. That, together with government guarantees, has kept credit from seizing up, even as a second wave of infections and lockdowns make a double-dip recession seem inevitable. An ecb survey published on November 24th found that access to finance was towards the bottom of small firms' list of anxieties.
All this, however, has done little to revive the outlook for inflation. The bank itself expects annual inflation of only 1.3% by 2022. Market participants are even gloomier (see chart 2 on next page). It is becoming harder to believe that the ecb can do much more by itself. The Economist spoke to executives from five of the euro area's biggest banks. None thought the ecb's cheap funding alone would stir demand for credit, or encourage banks to lend to risky prospects. Ms Lagarde insists stimulus is ""not exclusively a fiscal business"", and that the ecb can still do its bit. But in a speech on November 11th she made a forceful case for further fiscal action.
There have been two criticisms levelled at Ms Lagarde. One is that communication slip-ups over the past year show that she has only a weak grasp of the technical detail of monetary policy. That may in part reflect economists' snootiness. But her missteps did indeed move markets. In March her comment that the ecb ""was not here to close spreads"" sent Italian government-bond yields soaring. In September her seeming indifference to a strengthening euro and its impact on inflation meant the currency only rose further against the dollar. Both were followed the next day by an explanatory blog post from Philip Lane, the bank's accomplished chief economistseeming to correct the president's words.
Ms Lagarde is only too aware of the fact that markets hang on her every word, and now carefully watches what she says. In order to stress collective decision-making, blog posts by Mr Lane and others on the bank's executive board will no longer appear immediately after a press conference. Some wonks reckon she has improved markedly on the job. Still, it is hard to imagine her becoming a conviction rate-setter.
Where she does have conviction is on matters such as climate change and gender equality, subjects that she promoted while at the imf, to which grey-suited monetary policymakers generally give a wide berth- and which are the source of the second concern about her approach to central banking. It is instructive to compare Ms Lagarde's speeches and interviews over the past year with those of Mario Draghi, her predecessor. Though ""inflation"" has featured 190 times, she is half as likely to mention it as Mr Draghi did in 2018 and 2019. By contrast, Ms Lagarde has mentioned ""climate change"" 80 times-compared with just seven across Mr Draghi's entire eightyear term.
Climate change, according to Ms Lagarde, is an element not just of the ecb's ""secondary"" objective-which is to support the eu's economic policies. More controversially, she sees it as having a bearing on the bank's primary mandate of price stability. She has said before that the bank will consider the merits of ""green"" qe, which would tilt bond-buying away from polluters. The idea clashes with the views of many central bankers, including Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank. At a Bloomberg conference on November 16th, both Ms Yellen and Lord King worried about mission creep at central banks. Few economists think climate change has a big influence on inflation; most would point out that changing polluters' behaviour is a job for elected officials.
Ms Lagarde intends to win over the rest of the ecb's 25-strong governing council during the bank's strategy review, due to conclude in mid-2021. It will cover everything from relatively uncontroversial tweaks to the inflation target to more contested areas, the financial-stability effects of low interest rates and, of course, climate change. She says she hopes to convince her colleagues to ""appreciate that they should be not only on the right side of history and face their children and grandchildren with a straight face, but be able to focus on the core mandate of price stability"".
That the euro area has avoided a financial crisis means Ms Lagarde can look back on the past year with some satisfaction. But her term lasts for eight years-far longer than many politicians or executives hang around for. Her push to broaden the ecb's mission has just begun. And if some countries (eg, Germany) return to economic normality sooner than others (eg, Italy), then the ecb will also face tough choices about when precisely to unwind its emergency measures. The outsider's next seven years promise to be more controversial than the first one."

The Fed's former chairwoman will lead the Treasury. What does she stand for?
In the first instalment of the ""Harry Potter"" series, the protagonist stumbles across the Mirror of Erised. Anyone who looks into the mirror sees the ""deepest, most desperate desire"" of their hearts reflected back at them. There is a touch of Erised about President-elect Joe Biden's decision to nominate Janet Yellen as America's next treasury secretary, first reported on November 23rd. No economist is more qualified than Ms Yellen, a former head of the Federal Reserve and a respected academic, for the job. Perhaps more important, however, for what is a political role as much as an economic one, people from the progressive left to the conservative right can see something to like in her.
In today's political configuration, that matters. Mr Biden must tame a split in the Democratic Party between run-of-the-mill centrists and tear-it-down millennial socialists. And before she becomes treasury secretary, Ms Yellen must be confirmed by the Senate, which Republicans currently control. That hurdle ruled out candidates such as Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts whom many Republicans would never confirm because she is seen as too hostile to free markets and the financial industry.
In the days before the announcement Washington insiders believed the race was between Ms Yellen and Lael Brainard, a governor of the Fed. Some favoured Ms Brainard on the grounds that she had more expertise in trade economics, others because she is younger than Ms Yellen, and would therefore do a better job of balancing an elderly president. Left-leaning Democrats were particularly taken with Ms Brainard's monetary doveishness.
Yet Ms Yellen has many advantages of her own. She is an accomplished economist, originally specialising in labour economics, and is the president of the American Economic Association, the field's pre-eminent learned society. (There are also few better-liked people in the profession; wonks turn up their collars in homage to one of Ms Yellen's sartorial quirks.) She was a highly competent chairwoman of the Fed between 2014 and 2018, communicating the central bank's intentions clearly in advance so as not to take investors by surprise. Her experience at the Fed may prove useful given that the central bank and the Treasury must continue to cooperate to help the economic recovery 1 ? along. Under Ms Yellen there would be little chance of the sort of spat that has developed over the Fed's lending schemes (see next story).
The genius of choosing Ms Yellen lies in the fact that people of all political persuasions can find some reason to cheer her appointment. That means she will almost certainly be confirmed by the Senate. Take monetary policy. Hawks point out that during Ms Yellen's tenure the Fed raised rates from near zero to 1.25-1.5%. Doves counter that hawks were over-represented on the rate-setting panel at the time, and that Ms Yellen in fact did a good job of keeping them in check.
It is a similar story on fiscal policy. Shortly before Donald Trump became president, Ms Yellen argued that ""fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment"". She is on the board of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organisation that spends a lot of time warning people about the dangers of high public debt. Yet in the pandemic Ms Yellen has urged ""extraordinary fiscal support"". In June she co-signed a letter saying ""Congress must pass another economic recovery package.""
Passing another stimulus bill may be her first big task. Republicans and Democrats have been unable to agree on a replacement to the bill passed in the spring, with particular disagreement on the size of the eventual package, even as it is now clear that America's economic recovery is slowing. It is a lot to expect that the sheer force of one person could help break the deadlock, not least because Republicans are likely to retain control of the Senate for a while yet. But if anyone can do it, it may be Ms Yellen. *"

IMAGINE YOU are the boss of a public company. Normally you are busy making decisions, visiting outposts, talking to customers, suppliers and employees. The meetings are endless. You have little time for reflection. Then, suddenly this spring, after a bout of firefighting, the diary is bare. You sit in your study, hiding from the family, and ruminate-about what your firm lacks, about what it has too much of. You call a friendly investment banker and say: ""I may need to do a deal soon.""
The results of such stay-at-home strategy sessions are now apparent. The past few weeks have seen a burst of m&a activity. There are merger deals of all kinds, in all parts of the world, across many industries-from tech and health care to banking and publishing. The dealmakers at investment banks are joyful. The last time things were this busy, they say, was in 2007-08.
Shareholders have some call to fear the worst. There is a weighty body of literature, some of it dating from the stockmarket bust of the early 2000s, that says mergers do not create value for the acquiring company. More recent research is more nuanced. Mergers overseen by serial acquirers tend to add to value, it finds. Once m&a gets going, things can quickly get out of hand, of course. But this early in the economic cycle, and in the unusual circumstances, mergers are more likely to have a coherent logic to them.
To understand the burgeoning m&a boom, go back to January and February. Bankers had a full pipeline of deals. Then the pandemic took hold. A dealmaking ceo had to think again. If you had a merger in the works, you pulled it. You couldn't project numbers with confidence. You didn't know if you could afford a deal, or finance it. Even then, the calls with bankers never stopped. In place of black-tie events came virtual schmoozing-from one home study to another.
The deal pipeline started to thaw in June or July. Announcements have been coming thick and fast since. A lot of this is down to market conditions, which quickly turned favourable and have remained so. Equity prices have roared back from their lows of late March. The companies with shares that rallied first-technology and health care-found themselves with a highly valued currency with which to pay for deals. The corporate-bond market has reopened with a vengeance, making debt finance available. Interest rates are at rock bottom and likely to stay there for a while. Private-equity firms have a lot of unused capital (""dry powder"") to call upon.
But financial conditions are not the only explanation. The economy is another. The pandemic has given companies new problems to solve and made some existing ones more pressing. m&a offers a fix. Debt-laden firms need to sell assets. Buyers want to plug some strategic holes. The rationale for a deal might be to secure supply chains, to diversify across geographies, to acquire a specific (often digital) capability; or simply to bolster revenues or cut costs when the outlook for profits is rather bleak. Some of the transactions that are happening now are deals of opportunity, says Alison Harding-Jones, head of m&a in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Citigroup, a bank. And some are deals of necessity. Covid-19 has created winners and losers across industries, but also within them. ceos of winning companies may find that the acquisition on their lockdown wishlist is available. Those of losing companies must simply try to sell wisely.
Both kinds will be wary of the response from shareholders. The risks of getting the price wrong or of underestimating the hassle of integrating acquisitions are ever-present. But deals that have a decent-looking strategic case are likely to be given the benefit of the doubt. Serial dealmakers will get the most leeway. Research from McKinsey, a consultancy, finds that companies that do lots of smallish acquisitions over time tend to add value to them. Such ""programmatic acquirers"" take more care in assessing targets, aligning m&a with broader corporate strategy and integrating their purchases.
As a rule big, one-off deals are riskier. The dangers seem small now but will grow the longer the m&a boom goes on. Bosses will start to worry that their dealmaking rivals look more in command of events. They will be prone to the illadvised, grandiose merger. When the boom is all over, a few such souls will find themselves back in the study at home, but this time because they no longer have an office to go to, asking themselves: ""Why did I do it?"""

NEW YORK
Jerome Powell and Steve Mnuchin are at odds over emergency lending
As covid-19 spread across America, its fiscal and monetary tsars donned their masks, bumped elbows and presented a united front. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, slashed interest rates and bought Treasuries and mortgage debt. Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, pushed through a stimulus package worth $2.2trn that increased the generosity of unemployment benefits and secured funding for the Fed to support firms and market participants in need.
This partnership seemed to fracture on November 19th, when Mr Mnuchin wrote to Mr Powell to say that he would let several of the Fed's emergency lending schemes expire on December 31st. He asked for Treasury funds that had been allocated to the Fed, as capital to support these programmes, to be returned.
Mr Mnuchin's decision earned a rare rebuke from the Fed, which said that it ""would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities...continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our stillstrained and vulnerable economy. Just a few weeks earlier Mr Powell had said the pair were working on an extension. On November 20th, though, he acquiesced to Mr Mnuchin's request. The Treasury had allocated $i95bn in capital to support the Fed's programmes, half of which had been transferred to the central bank. The Fed will now return $7obn, keeping $25bn for loans it has already made.
Mr Mnuchin pointed out that the programmes that would cease-including facilities to buy corporate and municipal bonds, and those that make direct loans to firms-were under-used and seemed to have served their purpose. The Fed could have made up to $2trn-worth of loans; instead it lent just $25bn. The schemes were intended to quell market dysfunction; corporate-credit and municipal spreads on Treasuries have since normalised, and companies have been able to issue plenty of debt.
Emergency-lending schemes can act as a sort of insurance, even if they are not widely used. Indeed the mere announcement of the schemes in the spring served to kick-start credit markets, even before anything had been bought. But capital markets seemed to broadly endorse the idea that the Fed's emergency lending schemes were no longer needed. Stockmarket futures and bond yields dipped a little, as Mr Mnuchin's letter was published, but both had recovered by the end of the day. Credit spreads did not widen.
What might explain Mr Mnuchin's actions? With government-borrowing yields near all-time lows, the cost of allocating capital to the Fed's facilities is small. But the political costs may have been higher. When Mr Mnuchin and Mr Powell testified to Congress in September, no fewer than seven representatives quizzed them about the poor take-up of the Main Street Lending facility, which makes loans to firms.
Mr Mnuchin has suggested directing some of the funds to other schemes, such as the Paycheck Protection Programme, a vehicle that lends to small businesses, which ran out of funds in August. Perhaps he hopes that promising support for small firms will sway Republicans reluctant to approve another stimulus package. A less charitable explanation is that he wants to obstruct the next administration. The returned cash will go to the Treasury's General Fund, which will require legislation if it is to be tapped. If Janet Yellen, Presidentelect Biden's choice for treasury secretary, wants to use it, she will have to secure the votes first. *"

HONG KONG
Bad debts lead to even worse behaviour
Debt-collection videos have become a popular subgenre on Chinese clipsharing platforms. Many feature young men deftly fielding phone calls from aggressive collectors. Some portray the abuses-hair pulling, slapping-that have come to define a business that has long gone largely unregulated in China. The result has been a Wild West for collections. Debt collectors sometimes impersonate police officers; the details of debtors' friends and family are sold so that they can be harassed. A swift rise in personal debt, though, is forcing regulators to act.
Between 2015 and 2019 the stock of household debt in China rose by about $4.6trn, close to the $5.itrn accrued by Americans over a similar period before the global financial crisis of 2007-09, according to data from Rhodium Group, a consulting firm. The outstanding balance of delinquent consumer receivables could reach nearly 3.3trn yuan ($500bn) next year, up from just itrn yuan in 2015, reckons iResearch, another consultancy.
In June the southern city of Shenzhen drafted the country's first personal bankruptcy law. Courts routinely heard disputes between lenders and borrowers, but allowed only creditors to file suits. The new law, to be rolled out next year, will offer debtors more protection against creditors. A few other cities are conducting similar experiments, though ""these reforms are still very limited,"" says Li Jiao of Buren, a law firm.
The central bank, meanwhile, issued draft rules late last year, threatening to punish banks for working with dodgy debt collectors, though it softened the language before the guidelines took effect on November ist this year. Government pressure, say industry executives, has prompted consolidation. Some companies, such as yx Asset Recovery, have banned in-person visits and operate only call centres-a practice considered less intrusive. yx, which had more than 10,000 agents last year, has sworn off practices including selling debtor information, impersonating government officials, and threatening violence.
Yet the early reforms do not quite hit the mark. They have helped control debt collection for banks, but it is online lenders and microloan companies that pose a bigger risk. Delinquency rates have climbed above 30% this year at many nonbank lenders, compared to 5% for banks. Most online lenders are not targeted by the new rules and tend to hire local collections agencies that pursue aggressive, often-illegal tactics for recovering debts.
Nor has the shift away from in-person visits eliminated debtor harassment. Physical threats seem to be being replaced by mediated forms of ""emotional pressure"", applied during frequent phone calls, says Tom McDonald of the University of Hong Kong. Those seeking advice on how to deal with officious agents need look no further than the growing archive of debt-collection videos available online. *"

KABUL
The world's shrewdest financiers, hawala traders, are being squeezed
Packed trading floors are rare these days. An exception is the Shahzada currency-exchange market in Kabul. Seven days a week hundreds of men crowd into a modest courtyard. Each has a bundle of banknotes; some have piles several feet deep. Prices-for American dollars, Iranian rials and Pakistani rupees-ring out and deals are done, on the spot, in cash. In the small offices around the sides, money that is changed can then be transferred to almost anywhere in the world. Cash is handed over and WhatsApp messages fly.
The money travels by hawala (from the Arabic for ""transfer""), a centuries-old system. Transactions in opposite directions are matched against each other through a network of personal contacts. An Afghan in London sending remittances home might in turn finance a Kabuli merchant importing Chinese goods purchased in Britain. Banks may be used-but not formally. The sender is given a serial number, which they send (these days on WhatsApp) to the recipient, who then picks up the money from a contact of the hawala merchant.
Hawala is the core of Afghanistan's financial system. One in six adult Afghans has a bank account; there are just two branches for every 100,000. Most remittances-which some estimates reckon amount to 15-18% of the country's gdp each year-flow through it. Even international aid agencies use it. And Afghanistan is not the only place where hawala dominates. In Iraq, Somalia and Syria, the transfer system is vital too. Hawala is used in India and Pakistan to avoid slow and unwieldy banks. And the presence of huge numbers of migrants means it is well-established in the Gulf, especially Dubai.
Yet hawala is under intense pressure. Regulators around the world hate the system, because of its opacity and its role in helping to fund terrorism. And covid-19 has hammered many merchants, by drying up cross-border trade and closing the small shops and businesses that do transfers.
Hawala dominates in places like Afghanistan because it is so efficient. Margins on even small international transfers may be as low as 1%, far less than banks' charges. Indeed, sending money from Afghanistan to the West is often free, says Haroun Rahimi of the American University of Afghanistan. It is not only cheaper to use a hawala merchant than a bank, but quicker and easier too. Transfers can typically be picked up the same day. Customers do not need to prove their identity, or explain why the money is being sent. That is why it is essential in places like Afghanistan and Somalia, where large parts of the population do not have identity documents.
But this is also precisely why regulators dislike it. Western banks cut off anyone they suspect is using an account to send money to places that are considered highrisk, such as Afghanistan or Somalia. In India and Pakistan hawala merchants are arrested for evading the countries' capital controls. In Afghanistan the central bank, under foreign pressure to ensure transparency, has long sought to crack down on traders. In 2018 they were banned from holding deposits and making loans, and were required to start collecting documents on their customers. Instead of complying they went on strike, claiming that the new rules would destroy their business. Within a week the government had backed down. ""Shutting down hawala markets would paralyse the economy,"" says Mr Rahimi. Now an uneasy truce prevails.
Covid-19 has not helped hawala traders, many of whom also provide trade finance. In his office at Shahzada, Haji Zarak, the spokesman of the union of currency exchangers, says that the past year has been the toughest ever. When coronavirus first hit Afghanistan, the traders at the market went down to three days a week to socially distance. But the bigger hit was to goods trade. With borders closed, importers did not need to move money around, or to borrow to cover liquidity gaps. The only country with which transactions have increased is Turkey-which Mr Zarak suspects is largely rich Afghans moving money out to buy property, fearing a Taliban takeover. He worries about a second wave. ""If covid-19 comes back, we will be in trouble.""
What comes next for hawala? Some think that it can, in effect, be taken over. Abdul Bari Ahmadzai of Moore, a consultancy that works on Hesab Pay, a mobilemoney app, says if regulators allow it, hawala merchants could work as mobilemoney agents on the side. Transactions around the country at least could be done instantaneously on phones. In Somalia, where telecoms operators are largely unregulated, that has already happened. According to the World Bank, around threequarters of Somalis use mobile money- mostly denominated in dollars-and it is more common than cash. Mr Bari reckons the shift would in turn expand Afghans' access to banking, and gradually formalise the financial sector.
Yet that outcome is far from guaranteed. Hawala merchants will be nervous of anything that requires them to start collecting data or comply with other regulations. And if they do not, Afghanistan's few formal banks have a lot to lose by working with them. These already have only limited access to the international banking system. Huge amounts of money travel from Afghanistan to neighbouring Iran, its main source of imports. And as the number of people on America's sanctions list rises, the risks for western banks dealing in the region grows. They could decide to cut off many Afghans entirely. If that happens, hawala could be the only alternative left. *"

IN 2005 BEN BERNANKE, then a governor of America's Federal Reserve, noted a ""remarkable reversal in the flows of credit"" to several emerging economies, especially those in East Asia. These countries had begun to save more than they invested at home, becoming a ""net supplier of funds"" to the rest of the world. Their ""saving glut"", as Mr Bernanke called it, was helping finance America's widening current-account deficit, allowing the world's richest country to buy more goods and services from others than it sold to them. Mr Bernanke wondered whether this arrangement could, or should, persist. Some economists later blamed the glut for America's housing bubble.
Similar concerns are resurfacing. In the second quarter of this year, America's net national saving rate dipped below zero, as Stephen Roach of Yale University pointed out in the Financial Times last month. Lacking saving of its own, America instead borrowed ""surplus saving from abroad"", he wrote. Its current-account deficit widened faster in the second quarter than ever before recorded.
This sort of reasoning is quite common, not least in these pages. But a number of economists, including Michael Kumhof of the Bank of England, Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul of the Bank for International Settlements (bis) and Andrej Sokol of the European Central Bank, take strong issue with it. Echoing work by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat of the bis, they call for a careful distinction between flows of saving and flows of finance. The two are not the same. They need not even move together. The implication is that Mr Bernanke may have got things the wrong way around.
In everyday language, saving is the opposite of spending. The word evokes money accumulating in a bank account. And it is easy to imagine this money helping finance spending elsewhere. But in economics, saving is rather different. It is the opposite of consumption. By producing something that is not consumed, the economy is saving. Thus someone who spends all their earnings on home improvements is saving, however stretched they may seem, because a house is a durable asset, not a consumer trifle. Similarly a farmer who stores his harvest in a barn, rather than eating it, is saving-even if he never deposits money in a bank.
So how does saving, properly defined, flow across borders? Any output that is not consumed meets one of two fates: it is either invested or exported. It follows that anything that is neither consumed nor invested at home must be exported. (A farmer might, for example, export wheat to a barn overseas.) What flows across borders are the unconsumed goods and services themselves. ""Other countries are not sending saving to America to give it 'funds' to finance their imports,"" argue Mr Kumhof and Mr Sokol. ""Their net exports are the saving, by definition.""
But how then do Americans pay for these foreign goods? That raises the question of financing. Unlike saving, financing is inseparable from money. To ask ""how did you finance that?"" is to ask ""how did you obtain the money to buy that?"". Most money is brought into the world by banks, which have the happy ability to create it whenever they make a loan or purchase an asset. Thus the amount of financing available to a country depends heavily on the behaviour of banks, rather than on the amount of saving that either it or its trading partners do.
In a world of gluts and deficits, who finances whom? The conventional answer is that countries with excess saving finance those with saving shortfalls. But this less conventional group of economists argues that the answer depends not on the geography of saving and investment but on that of banking and finance. In many cases, American importers will fund their purchases with dollars borrowed from (or already held in) American banks.
When the purchase is complete, the dollars will be held by foreigners. They then represent a foreign financial claim on America. Because America is buying more stuff from the world than it sells, these claims on America will grow faster than the payments it receives for its exports. Many conventional economic models treat these net payment flows as the only kind of capital flow. But in reality, they are but a small fraction of the financial flows between countries. Many cross-border transactions, after all, do not involve goods and services at all. They instead represent purchases of foreign assets, including shares, bonds, property and the like. In the year Mr Bernanke made his speech, the net capital outflow from ""saving glut"" countries (with current-account surpluses) was 2.5% of global gdp. Gross capital flows, by comparison, were around 30%, according to Mr Borio and Mr Disyatat.
Gluttonous behaviour
An excess of saving, then, determines neither the geographical source nor the scale of cross-border financing. Nor is excess saving necessarily the right causal starting point. The paper by Mr Kumhof and others models what they call a ""credit glut"": an abundance of lending by American banks to the country's citizens. In spending this fresh money, Americans would no doubt suck in goods from abroad. This leads other countries to increase their saving, since America cannot import goods that are being consumed or invested elsewhere. But in this case, the increase in foreign saving and surpluses is a side-effect of a financial boom within America, not a cause of its overspending. The authors believe a credit, rather than a saving, glut is a more convincing explanation for the pre-2008 imbalances identified by Mr Bernanke, although they have less to say about more recent developments.
For many people (including some economists), it is natural to think that saving must precede investment and that deposits must precede bank lending. It is therefore tempting to see saving as a source of funding and the prime mover in many macroeconomic developments. Mr Kumhof and his co-authors see things differently, giving banks a more active, autonomous role. They give less credit to saving and more to credit."

But there are doubts about the data describing its efficacy
On november IBRD, for the third Monday in a row, the results of an anticovid vaccine were announced. This time the protagonists were AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, and Oxford University. They reported their vaccine to be 70% effective. But doubts have since arisen about the conduct of the trials which arrived at this figure.
The consortium's researchers estimated their vaccine's efficacy from interim data collected by trials in Britain and Brazil. These involve more than 23,000 volunteers, half of whom have received the vaccine and the other half a placebo of one sort or another. Like the previous offerings (one from a partnership between Pfizer, a big American pharma company, and BioNTech, a small German one; the second from another American firm, Moderna), the AstraZeneca-Oxford inoculation is administered in two jabs. Of those given it, none has been admitted to hospital with covid-19, nor suffered a severe case of it. The researchers from AstraZeneca and Oxford also say that their vaccine may reduce passage of the virus between people-a property not yet established for either of the other two. An ideal vaccine needs to break the chain of transmission, as well as stopping recipients from falling ill, so this claim is important.
Half measures?
The consortium's claim of 70% efficacy is, however, complicated by concerns about a slip-up during the trials which meant some participants were given only a half-dose of the vaccine to start with, followed by a full one. Intriguingly, the efficacy of this approach seemed to be about 90%. But if that is confirmed as correct, it follows that the efficacy of the intended protocol is actually only 62%. Further complications are that the half-dose group was a small fraction of the total, making statistical analysis less robust, and that group members were under 55, rather than fully representative of the population.
Why a lower initial dose might yield a stronger response is puzzling. The answer may lie in how the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine delivers genetic material from the coronavirus into the recipient's body, in order to stimulate that person's immune system. It uses what is known as a viral vector to carry this material, a substance called RNA that is a cousin of dna. The other two vaccines deliver rna as a ""naked"" molecule, wrapped up in a fatty bubble.
Before the trials began, some researchers had worried that going down the viralvector route might cause people to develop immunity to the vector as well as to the coronavirus proteins which the rna payload would encourage that person's cells to make. The findings from the accidental subgroup hint that anti-vector immunity may, indeed, be happening, causing a large first dose to prime the body to develop antibodies to the vector. These would then attack the second-dose vectors before they could do their job. A smaller first dose might diminish this priming effect-explaining the better efficacy of unequal doses. The researchers expect to gather more information about the nature of the immune response in the weeks ahead.
As with data on the other two vaccines, much of the information provided so far is frustratingly preliminary. However, the Oxford group say they hope soon to submit a paper, presumably containing fuller information, to a journal. It is not clear when those developing the other two vaccines will do the same, but data from their trials will be made available prior to meetings with the American regulator in December.
Haste versus speed
The headline figure of 70% efficacy contrasts superficially with announced values of 95% for the other two vaccines. But, tempting as it is to compare these figures, that is actually hard to do. The most important reason for this is that developers count covid-19 cases in different ways. In particular, the AstraZeneca-Oxford trials checked participants for asymptomatic infection, rather than relying on self-reported symptoms to establish who was infected. The number of cases after vaccination may therefore seem higher than for the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna jabs, which relied on self-reporting by patients with a follow-up confirmatory test.
One bonus of the AstraZeneca-Oxford offering is that, if approved, it could be rolled out quickly. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's boss, says his firm has partnerships with suppliers in India, Latin America, Russia and Thailand. The Serum Institute in India agreed to manufacture the vaccine in bulk as long ago as April. ""We are going to supply low- and middle-income countries around the world from different sources,"" Mr Soriot says. ""We are aiming at doing this more or less at the same time, so everybody gets access in an equitable manner as quickly as possible."" Altogether, AstraZeneca says the capacity exists to make 3bn doses of its vaccine over the course of next year. That compares with i.3bn of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while Moderna hopes for between 500m and ibn.
The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is also cheap, and can be kept for at least six months in a normal refrigerator, meaning it can be stored in any surgery or pharmacy around the world. Moderna's vaccine, by contrast, can be kept in an ordinary fridge for just a month. The Pfizer-BioNTech offering is even more sensitive. For most of the time it needs ultra-cold storage at -70°C. It can sit in a standard fridge for only a few days. Richard Hatchett, the head of cepi, a foundation that pays for research into vaccines against novel pathogens, says he thinks the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has the potential to alter the course of the pandemic, and could be delivered anywhere, including poor countries.
Although AstraZeneca says its vaccine was well tolerated by those who received it, questions remain about an unknown adverse event which caused trials to be halted temporarily earlier this year. These, and other matters, must now be considered by regulators, as they assess applications for emergency authorisation that the makers of all three vaccines will submit. AstraZeneca says it will also seek an emergency listing from the World Health Organisation. That would permit its jabs to be used in places which do not have regulatory authorities capable of assessing vaccines.
If time were not of the essence, it would make sense to wait for longer-term data on all the new vaccines. But in the face of a pandemic, that is not sensible. Regulations to allow for emergency use are designed for just such situations. Regulators will, however, have to keep tight control of these new vaccines to start with. At the outset their use will probably be restricted to those who need them most-doctors, nurses and other health-care workers, and also the elderly. Regulators will also insist on close monitoring for side-effects. But, as data accumulate over the first months of next year, those chains are likely to be loosened. The past three weeks, then, have transformed the prospects for 2021. The world now knows covid vaccines are possible. Let the hard work begin."

And now it can be used indirectly for that purpose, too
In the history of medicine, praise is rightly showered on those who invented vaccines, antibiotics, antiseptics and anaesthetics. Few, though, remember Charles Chamberland, inventor of the humble autoclave. Yet the ability to sterilise surgical instruments reliably, by exposing them to high-pressure steam in such a device, has been crucial to the development of modern surgery. A mere 12 minutes in an autoclave at 121°C and two atmospheres of pressure kills 99.99% of common pathogenic bacteria. Standard boiling, at 100°C and one atmosphere, takes 80 hours to achieve that level of bactericide.
Electrically powered autoclaves have, as a consequence, become so routine as to be almost unregarded-at least in those places with a reliable electricity supply. Where electricity is not reliable, though, it can be hard to keep surgical instruments germfree. This is a problem to which Zhao Lin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thinks he may have an answer. As he and his colleagues describe in Joule, they have designed an autoclave that is powered directly by sunlight. And not only that; they also reckon it should cost just a tenth as much to make commercially as a conventional autoclave of equivalent potency.
Dr Zhao's device is a work of simplicity and cheap materials. It consists of a metrelong box of rectangular cross section, with two curved fins of polished aluminium, just under 30cm high, sticking out of the top (see diagram). Each fin, seen end on, forms a section of a parabola, and it is a property of parabolic mirrors to focus light from distant sources (the sun, for example) onto a single point-or, in the case of elongated mirrors like these, onto a line.
The new invention's principal trick is that these focal lines coincide with the edges of a copper plate within the box. This plate is part of a commercially available device called a fin-tube absorber. The absorber's other element is a copper pipe running along the plate's central axis. The particular geometry of the aluminium fins means that any incident sunlight will continue to be focused onto the copper plate even when the sun is not directly overhead. Anything inside the pipe is therefore going to get-and stay-pretty hot.
Within the box, the fin-tube absorber is seated on a bed of glass fibre, an excellent insulator, and it is covered with a layer of silica aerogel. This stuff, referred to colloquially as ""solid smoke"" because it has a density of a mere 200 milligrams per cubic centimetre, has the valuable properties of being transparent to light but opaque to heat. This means it admits the sunshine reflected from the mirrors while keeping the pipe as hot as possible. Although such a material sounds rather high-tech, and does, indeed, require specialist equipment to make, silica aerogel is actually quite cheap to buy, at $4 a litre. And a production model of the autoclave, Dr Zhao reckons, would require only half a litre of the stuff.
The whole thing is then topped off with a pane of glass, to protect the aerogel from damage while admitting light. All that is needed after this is to attach a sterilisation chamber to one end of the pipe and a water supply to the other, and then aim the mirrors at the sun. With an appropriate arrangement of valves, the sun's heat will boil the water, heat the resulting steam well above boiling-point and increase the pressure in the tube-and thus also in the sterilisation chamber.
In tests carried out at a hospital in Mumbai, in partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology in that city, Dr Zhao's new autoclave was able to sustain steam at a temperature of 128°C and two atmospheres of pressure for half an hour. When tested with autoclave indicator tape, a material used routinely to make sure autoclaves are working properly, it passed with flying colours, meaning it would have successfully sterilised anything within the sterilisation chamber.
Demand for this product is likely to be high. Some 15% of hospital patients in lowand middle-income countries get infected while receiving treatment, and surgery is an important cause of this iatrogenesis. Dr Zhao therefore hopes to have commercial versions ready by 2022. Recognition for his work, as Chamberland might have observed, could take a while longer."

NEW YORK
Child-safety laws may have surprising unintended consequences
In the early 1970s American women gave birth, on average, to 2.12 children each. By 2018 that figure had fallen to 1.73. Many alterations in people's lives have been invoked to help explain this change, including the facts that women now are better educated, more likely to have jobs or run businesses, and have better access to contraception than their antecedents of five decades ago. Also, demand for children to work as extra pairs of hands on family farms has dropped.
None of these explanations, though, overlaps neatly with birth-rate curves. Other factors must be at work, too. And Jordan Nickerson and David Solomon, professors of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston College respectively, think they have found an intriguingly counterintuitive one: America's increasingly protective child car-seat laws.
Their study, ""Car seats as contraception"", published in ssrn, a repository for so-called preprint papers that have yet to undergo formal peer review, examines the effect that car-seat policies may have had on American birth rates between 1973 and 2017. During the Reagan era, only the truly wee-tots aged under three-had normally to be secured in child-safety seats. But states' governments have, since then, gradually ramped up the requirements. Today, most places in America make children sit in safety seats until their eighth birthdays. That concern for youngsters' safety has had the unintended consequence, Dr Nickerson and Dr Solomon suggest, of fewer three-child families.
In drawing this conclusion they have correlated census data with changes in state laws on safety seats. They discovered that tightening those laws had no detectable effects on the rates of births of first and second children, but was accompanied by a drop, on average, of 0.73 percentage points in the number of women giving birth to a third while the first two were young enough to need safety seats. That may not sound much, but it is a significant fraction of the 9.36% of women in the sample who did become third-time mothers.
The authors also made two other pertinent observations. The reduction they saw was confined to households that did actually have access to a car. And it was larger in households where a man was living with the mother. The latter point is relevant, they think, because this man would take up space in a vehicle that could otherwise be occupied by a child.
And space in the vehicle is the crucial factor. In pre-safety-seat days, squeezing three young children into the back of a family saloon was a perfectly feasible proposition. Most such cars, though, can comfortably accommodate only two safety seats. So, the older a child must be before no safety seat is required, the longer a family must wait before a third child will fit in the car. Sometimes, that wait will mean no third child is ever conceived and born.
Unless, of course, the family concerned buys a bigger car. And here things get yet more interesting, for the obvious reasons not to do so-big cars cost more, and are more costly to run-may not be the only disincentive to changing. Dr Nickerson and Dr Solomon found, in fact, that the third-child deterrent appears stronger among wealthier families. As they observe, ""large cars like minivans also have class and aesthetic connotations that may make people reluctant to switch even when they can afford to.""
Back-seat driver
Oddly, though, the authors do not leave it at that. Instead, they point to previous studies which suggest that, for children over two, safety seats are no better than seat belts at protecting against death or serious injury in a crash. They estimate that laws requiring children to sit in special seats until they are eight years old saved about 57 lives in 2017 and contrast that number with the 8,000 children who might have been conceived and born in the absence of such rules. There is, they conclude, no ""compelling social interest"" in requiring child seats for children over four.
This seems weird. Comparing putative lives forgone to actual lives saved is, to put it politely, a strange moral calculation. And the empirical basis for it is, in any case, doubtful. Alisa Baer, a paediatrician in New York who specialises in car-seat safety and who says she has installed at least 15,000 such seats over the years (she is known as ""The Car Seat Lady""), says that this part of the paper is ""completely preposterous"". Children's car seats, she says, ""save the quality of life"" of children who would suffer higher rates of injury compared with simply belting up-including massive abdominal trauma and paralysis. A recent study by Mark Anderson at the University of Washington and Sina Sandholt at Columbia University bears this point out.
That does not, though, detract from the wider observation Dr Nickerson and Dr Solomon make that well-intentioned actions can have surprising knock-on effects. And one such, it seems, is that the back seats of American cars, once renowned as places where children were conceived, may now, themselves, be acting as contraceptives. *"

How one of history's most formidable marine predators raised its young
If sharks had bony skeletons, which preserve easily as fossils, rather than cartilaginous ones, which do not, then Otodus megalodon would probably be as famous as Tyrannosaurus rex. Even though only its teeth are routinely available for study, it has starred in at least one film, ""The Meg"", released in 2018. Were it better known, a whole ocean-based franchise akin to ""Jurassic Park"" might now exist.
No matter. It is still an intriguing animal. Adults are reckoned to have reached a length of 18 metres. (T. rex was 12 metres from snout to tip of tail.) And megalodons, as they are called colloquially, lasted as a species from the beginning of the Miocene epoch 23m years ago to 3m years ago, during the Pliocene. That is far longer than T. reXs brief appearance 68m-66m years ago at the end of the Cretaceous. Their family life has, however, hitherto been obscure.
Perhaps ""family"" is a slight exaggeration. But many modern sharks lay their eggs (or, if viviparous, give birth) in places known as shark nurseries. Jose Herraiz of the University of Valencia and his colleagues wondered if that had also been true of megalodons. As they report this week in Biology Letters, it seems it was.
Shark nurseries are shallow coastal areas that have abundant food available and are, precisely because of their shallowness, difficult for predators like other, bigger sharks to move around in. Some 16m years ago part of north-eastern Spain, between what are now the cities of Barcelona and Tarragona, was just such a shallow, protected bay. And two quarries dug into the rock that formed from the sediment in this bay have yielded a number of megalodon teeth.
Shark's teeth indicate, by their size and shape, the size of their possessor's body. That is how O. megalodon's adult length has been estimated. But body size within a species is also a good indicator of age. Dr Herraiz and his colleagues therefore studied the 25 best-preserved megalodon teeth from these quarries, to deduce the size distribution, and thus the age distribution, of the sharks that had lived there.
To do so they used a formula for length determination worked out for great whites, the largest existing shark that hunts individual prey. (There are larger species, such as the whale shark and the basking shark, but these filter small prey from the water in a manner similar to baleen whales.) Applying this formula to the teeth from the quarries, they found that the sharks in question had probably ranged in length from about three to 14 metres. These animals were therefore either juveniles or small adults, suggesting it was, indeed, a nursery.
Thus encouraged, the researchers then applied their method to eight other sites from which megalodon teeth have been recovered (see chart). Four were similarly youngster-dominated. The other four were dominated by adults. They therefore think they have identified five megalodon nurseries. The remainder, they suspect, were either breeding grounds or feeding grounds for grown-ups."

An era ends for radio astronomy
Arecibo observatory was conceived in an era of space-age monumentalism, an imposition of geometry onto geology as striking in its simplicity and scale as the greatest brutalist architecture. When the James Bond franchise, in its pomp a showcase for iconic 1960s design, eventually got around to using the 306-metre dish as a location in the 1990s, the only surprise was that it had taken so long.
The observatory was not new to spycraft. It was created as a tool for using radar to study the ionosphere, an electrically charged upper layer of the atmosphere. America's defence department had an interest in such work, which might lead to new ways of characterising incoming missiles or of snooping on enemy transmissions, so it stumped up some cash.
A free-standing dish big enough for the job would have been impractical. The designers therefore looked for a hole in the ground to repurpose. They found it in north-western Puerto Rico, a sinkhole where the limestone landscape had collapsed in just the right way. They built three towers on the sinkhole's rim and hoisted the electronic heart of the instrument-the bit which emits and receives radio waves- into the empty space between them. Signals travelling to or from this equipment would bounce off eight hectares of wire mesh stretched out beneath it.
As a radar, Arecibo used the world's biggest dish to study not just the ionosphere but also the surfaces of nearby planets and passing asteroids. But it was as a radio telescope that it truly excelled, making some crucial discoveries during the 1960s and 1970s, radio astronomy's golden age. The most famous was a pair of pulsars-spinning neutron stars-orbiting each other in a way which was shown to prove Einstein's general theory of relativity. Later data revealed planets around another pulsar. This was the first definitive detection of planets beyond the solar system.
Arecibo was also used for radio astronomy's wayward offshoot, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Since 1960 radio astronomers have occasionally employed their instruments to look for artificial signals from the stars. In 1974, after an upgrade that saw the original mesh replaced by a dish made up of 38,778 aluminium panels, Arecibo was used to go a step further. It transmitted a 1,679-bit message towards a star cluster 25,000 light-years away. Encoded in this message were graphical representations of basic biochemistry and astronomy, and of the technology with which it had been sent.
Over time, technological advance eroded the advantages of Arecibo's sheer size, and its funding dwindled. The engineering began to show its age. In August one of the cables supporting the instrument platform snapped, damaging the dish. The snapping of a second, in early November, seemed to presage imminent collapse. And so it is to be closed.
But as the vegetation beneath the dish rises through its remains, and the site falls into picturesque ruin, the sketch of its cross-section encoded in that message from the 1970s will continue on its way. It is already 46 light-years from Earth. Its pixels now constitute the farthest-flung memorial to a human achievement anywhere in the universe. And they always will. *"

By Tim Harper. Allen Lane; 864 pages; £35. To be published in America by Harvard University Press in January; $39.95
In june 1919 a petition circulated among delegates to the peace conference at Versailles. The ""Demands of the Annamite People"" claimed to speak for the inhabitants of the part of French Indochina that is today the heart of Vietnam. The petition, Tim Harper writes, was one of many ""into which were decanted the hopes of entire peoples"". Its demands seemed moderate enough-things like freedom of the press, the right to education, abolition of government by decree-and it was received politely by Woodrow Wilson and even the president of the French republic.
But its tone, of presuming to speak directly to power, got under the skin of the French authorities, who had built an empire in Indochina on the back of forced labour, while plantations ran their own private prisons. As the document circulated among the diplomatic missions and, within two months, hit the streets of Hanoi, the security services knew that its author, Nguyen Ai Quoc-a pseudonym meaning ""Nguyen the Patriot""-was in some way important. They were to maintain that conviction for more than three decades.
Briefly, Nguyen Ai Quoc would break cover, for instance to address political meetings in Paris, scruffily dressed. Yet the expanding secret-police files on him reflected official frustration. He lied about his age, his name, his origins and his profession. He changed his accent to suit. Time and again, Nguyen Ai Quoc slipped like quicksilver through the fingers of imperial powers. His shadow was found in libraries, cafés and boarding houses across France, in port cities such as Singapore and New York, and even in the London suburb of Ealing; one rumour had him as a pastry chef under the great Escoffier. His writings surfaced in illicit journals in China and Korea. But just when the SÛreté Générale picked up his scent again, he was gone.
Nguyen Ai Quoc is emblematic of a global underground of Asian nationalists and revolutionaries that is the subject of this superbly original book. In it, Mr Harper, a historian at the University of Cambridge, describes how in the first decades of the 20th century dreams took hold of a continent freed from imperial shackles-British shackles in India and South-East Asia, Dutch in the Dutch East Indies (modernday Indonesia), French in Indochina and those of assorted European powers in China. These dreams were nurtured in the liminal cracks of empire: in steerage class along the new steamship routes connecting Asia with Europe and North America, in the doss houses of teeming port cities from Yokohama to Marseille, and among the modernist and radical circles in metropolitan centres such as London and Paris.
""Underground Asia"" breaks new ground by showing how a collective consciousness emerged among revolutionaries on this shifting terrain. Some were well-heeled, sent to Europe with imperial blessing for a 1 ? good education. Sumatran traditions encouraged young men like Tan Malaka to expose themselves to ""the largeness of the world""; he went to the Netherlands. Others were more like Nguyen Ai Quoc, whose father, a local magistrate, was cashiered for drunken violence, whose sister hung out with pirates, and who worked his passage to Europe as an ordinary seaman. All nevertheless shared resources and knowledge, made alliances, or ""were simply witness to each other, drawing strength from a sense of co-presence"". Activists from China, Japan and Vietnam struggled to understand each other's speech. But through ""brushtalk""-deploying the Chinese logograms common to all their writing systems-they laboriously exchanged ideas into the night.
Back home this wave of consciousness fostered experiments in mass education and political instruction, a new culture popularised by radical ""mosquito journals"". It generated a powerful belief that-as Narendra Nath Bhattacharya, the Indian revolutionary better known as M.N. Roy, put it-Europe was not the world.
This was a fluid realm. Western ideas raced back to Asia, transmuting into action. Anarchism, ""the quintessential ideology of exile"", shaded into the republicanism of Giuseppe Mazzini and Sinn Fein. At times, Islam claimed to transcend borders.
Back to the future
After Nicholas II of Russia abdicated in 1917, meanwhile, ""the tempests of the world outside blew directly into the households of Surabaya and Semarang."" On seizing power, Vladimir Lenin had looked to Europe's working classes to foster wider revolution. When that hope fizzled, the revolutionary potential of Asian peasantries-whom Lenin, like the colonialists, had hitherto deemed backward-was reassessed. Asian radicals were summoned to Moscow. Nguyen Ai Quoc, M.N. Roy and Tan Malaka were at the heart of what Mr Harper calls the greatest missionary effort in Asia since the Jesuits set out to convert China, India and Japan in the 16th century.
In Asia, and even in imperial homelands, action sometimes took violent form. Assassinations were attempted against the British viceroy of India and the governorgeneral of French Indochina. In early 1925 a young Chinese woman with the bob-cut of the ""Modern Girl"", an attitude popularised in Shanghai and Tokyo before Paris or New York, walked into a welfare office in Kuala Lumpur and coolly tried to blow up two British functionaries.
Such violence aroused lurid fears of a ""yellow peril"". In truth, strikes and boycotts targeting economies that required colonial subjects to be both producers and consumers had more effect. But by the late 1920s the authorities had the upper hand. Not least, borders were no longer porous, while the SÛreté and its counterparts had established ids, fingerprinting and rigorous record-keeping. They recruited narks and watchmen from the same waterfronts and brothel areas inhabited by the revolutionaries. International co-operation was regularised when Interpol was founded in 1923.
Radicals caught in the colonial net were rounded up and sent to detention centres, such as at Port Blair in India's Andaman Islands or, in the case of Indonesians, to Boven Digoel, upriver in malarial New Guinea. Mr Harper argues that these camps were a harbinger of the kind in which political undesirables would be held in Europe.
After the devastation suffered by even the victorious powers during the second world war, Asia's revolutionaries saw fresh chances. Some seized the moment and rode to power. Today Nguyen Ai Quoc, he of countless aliases, has one of Asia's most teeming metropolises named after him: Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Malaka, by contrast, was devoured by the revolution he helped spawn-killed by his own side in the fight against the Dutch and the British.
Yet the lives of both men are testament to an early premonition that, far from being a morass of backwardness requiring firm imperial tutelage, Asia lay, as Mr Harper writes, ""at the forefront of human futures"". And so, though many of the revolutionaries he evokes are now forgotten-or, for some Asian nations, too inconvenient to remember-their underground stories still echo through time. *"

It was snapped up for a television adaptation starring Colin Farrell that is due to air soon. That novel's many admirers will wonder whether Mr McGuire's new book, ""The Abstainer"", has the same pageturning pull.
This time the setting is tamer. It is 1867 and James O'Connor, a Dublin policeman, is on secondment in Manchester, though the assignment is not of his choosing. He is a man adrift: when his beloved wife and young son died of illness in Ireland, he took to drink, and this job is his last chance. O'Connor is the abstainer of the title, haunting coffee houses instead of saloons.
The fictional copper arrives just as three real historical figures are to be hanged for the murder of a policeman; the men were Fenians (agitators for Irish independence) and afterwards became known as the ""Manchester Martyrs"". O'Connor sees that this is what they will become, and that the hangings are merely cruelty and bombast: ""Yet cruelty and bombast are what the English prefer.""
His antagonist is Stephen Doyle. Born in Sligo, Doyle left for America as a teenager and fought in the civil war; he has now come to Manchester as a Fenian operative. He has about him something of the terror of Henry Drax, the animating force of wickedness in ""The North Water"", though Doyle's character is softened by a compelling backstory and the reader's understanding of his ultimate political aim.
This blend of politics, personal tragedy and revenge is moreishly compelling. The book's powerful setting is almost a character in itself. Mr McGuire teaches creative writing in Manchester and his passion for the city shines through. The physical world that he imagines assails the reader's senses: the stink of a tannery, the clangour of factory bells and the way O'Connor's grief drives him to a ruthlessness beyond his nature.
The novel's weakness is its ending, when Mr McGuire swerves away from the consummation readers may be expecting. A small shame-but it is still worth raising a toast to ""The Abstainer""."

Two years ago your reviewer stood in an office overlooking the Pacific Ocean at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, California. Outside, giant pelicans sliced through the sea air. Inside, the walls and windows were shaken by a below-bass note that boomed out of huge speakers. This, said John Ryan, an oceanographer, was the moan of a humpback whale, the darling of whalewatchers, known for its impressive finand tail-slapping displays and haunting ""song"". Most recordings of humpbacks seem almost violin-like, but this was much, much deeper-barely a sound, more a vibration that was felt rather than heard.
In the opening scene of ""Fathoms"", Rebecca Giggs describes a very different kind of encounter with a humpback: on a beach in Perth, Australia, where a young giant had found itself stranded. For three days, she witnessed its enormous mass crushing its vital organs; the blubber that evolved over millions of years to keep the species alive in the frigid abyss now had the opposite effect. The humpback, she says, ""was boiling alive in the kettle of itself"".
Stirred by this encounter, Ms Giggs embarks on a poetic exploration of the largest creatures alive today. ""Fathoms"" is a series of essays that span aeons and vast amounts of space, from the bottom of the ocean to the far reaches of the solar system. The Voyager probe carries a recording of humpback song; ionic bursts at the surface of the Sun ricochet through space, provoke the shimmery displays of the Northern Lights and eventually disrupt the geomagneticfield maps that whales use to orient themselves. Throughout, Ms Giggs weaves the human and whale stories around a central question: did the conservationists of the late 20th century save the whales from extinction-by-slaughter, only to deliver them to a more insidious demise? From plastics to toxins, warming oceans, melting sea ice, acidifying waters and modified soundscapes, humanity is warping everything that whales need to live and thrive.
Many of these changes are reflected in the whales themselves. Their flesh, guts, blood and even their song are all, in this telling, a record of human activity. One whale is found to have ingested an entire greenhouse. Postmortems performed on others reveal gas-bubble lesions, ruptured ear canals and abnormal nitrogen levels, all of which are eventually linked to antisubmarine warfare training. And after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, researchers who were monitoring stress hormones in North Atlantic right whales (by analysing their faeces) noticed that their subjects had relaxed, presumably because most ships temporarily returned to port and, for that time, the oceans were quiet.
Death runs through the pages. Today it would be impossible to write a book about whales that did not combine a sense of awe with inevitable tragedy. But ""Fathoms"" is brilliantly full of wonder. A passage lingers on whale lice, describing how, even now, their genes hold traces of an epic migration made by at least one right whale in the past im-2m years. Another marvels at how the decimation of whales in the oceans has transformed ecologies on land: the past movements of whaling communities can be traced in aerial surveys of Arctic vegetation, in places made richer and greener by buried giants. A third section asks whether conserving whale populations might help stabilise the climate. Whales draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and down into the abyss, by fertilising tiny plankton with their faeces, as well as when they die and sink to the sea floor.
The tragedy is detached rather than gory. In places it is beautiful. The afterlife of a whale is tracked from the surface, where its floating carcass is pecked, chewed and debrided by scavengers, down through the water column, past fish that resemble ""bottled fireworks"", to its resting place on the seabed. There, ""the ballooning mass scatters skin and sodden flesh...upon which grows a carpet of white worms."" One ""whale fall"" feeds entire ecosystems. It jiggles with life-crabs, fish, worms, bacteria. ""A whale body is, to this glitter splash of biology, a godsend,"" writes Ms Giggs in one of her finest turns of phrase.
When she encounters a live whale, she feels herself shrink to the size of a pinhead yet retains the detachment that she applies, elsewhere, to her observation of dead ones. She does not sense the affinity that others aver. ""Only the most witless individual would believe in a benevolent connection with real whales,"" she insists. In the presence of leviathan, ""the adrenalin in me was the kick of imminent danger."" *"

The moment he saw an organ, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart knew what to do with it. Aged six, already a prodigy on the clavier, he encountered pedals and stops for the first time in an Austrian church. Within moments he was accompanying mass and improvising freely. In the following year, 1763, an official in Heidelberg was so astonished by his organ-playing that he had a plate engraved for his church to mark the boy's visit. Mozart composed his first symphony at eight. His father wrote that ""every day God performs fresh miracles through this child.""
Youthful promise often wanes. With Mozart the reverse was true: his precocity only hinted at the wonders to come. Through him classical music may have found its most ideal expression. As Jan Swafford writes in his outstanding biography, Mozart's compositions displayed ""a kind of effortless perfection so easily worn that they seem almost to have written themselves"". He drafted quickly, often without needing to revise. He ""could dispense delight by the yard"". A man of his time rather than a reactionary like Bach or a revolutionary like Beethoven, Mozart was equally at home composing for the concert salon or the opera stage.
Mr Swafford eschews myths about tortured genius. Mozart, he insists, ""was fundamentally a happy man"". Despite his natural gifts, he worked relentlessly to master his art. He enjoyed a contented and loving marriage, and deftly parried his scheming father, who clung to his coat-tails while resenting his success. As he made his life's journey from Salzburg to Vienna he remained childlike and obscene, fixated on bottoms. Mr Swafford describes ""an inex- 1 ? plicable force of nature who could rise from a luminous improvisation at the clavier for a round of meowing like a cat and leaping over the furniture"".
He is the subject of many biographies, but the leading one, by Hermann Abert, is 100 years old and 1,600 pages long. Mr Swafford, himself a composer and a programme-writer for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, offers an updated, accessible and authoritative life, beautifully written and full of astute critical judgments and incisive notes on the works. The overture to ""The Marriage of Figaro"" is all ""quicksilver brightness"" and ""indefatigable energy""; the Piano Trio in B-flat Major has ""only a touch of galant preciousness"". ""Eine kleine Nachtmusik"" is ""crystalline perfection"".
Mozart's way with melody and keen view of human nature-his letters reveal an almost Dickensian ability to paint character-combined to elevate opera from light fare to a serious medium, the author contends. ""His wit, his often-mordant scrutiny of people and their foibles, his fascination with the frenzies of love and lovemaking-all this made him the consummate composer"" of the form, Mr Swafford reckons. As his characters scrambled around the stage, lost in the human comedy, Mozart gave them divine arias.
He was admired but not adored in his time. Most of his music adhered to conventional structures yet went over the heads of the average listener. Legend has it that his most important patron, Emperor Joseph II, reacted to one performance with backhanded criticism: ""Too beautiful for our ears, my dear Mozart, and monstrous many notes!"" Mozart, irrepressible and ever cheeky, supposedly replied: ""Exactly as many as necessary, Your Majesty!"" *"

During the Obama years, the Onion, a satirical online newspaper, carried a series of articles about a man it referred to as ""Diamond Joe"" and ""The President of Vice"". It featured headlines like ""Shirtless Biden Washes Trans Am in White House Driveway"" and ""Biden Huddling With Closest Advisers on Whether to Spend 200 Bucks on Scorpions Tickets"".
The real Joe Biden, then vice-president, was a teetotaling and avuncular elder statesman, not a hair-metal-loving party animal. But the caricature of him as a regular guy drew on an element of truth. The now-president-elect, the son of a second-hand-car salesman, will be the first president since Ronald Reagan to lack an Ivy League degree, having finished near the bottom of his class at both the University of Delaware and Syracuse University's law school.
And this is reflected in his use of language. In his speech, he is such an everyman as to defy parody. ""Saturday Night Live"", which has featured impersonators for every president since Chevy Chase's Gerald Ford, has yet to settle on a memorable Joe Biden. Forced to name Bidenisms, you might single out ""malarkey"", his favoured disparagement for humbug, or ""Here's the deal"", to signal that he's about to cut the malarkey. His favourite vocative is the folksy ""Folks..."". In his first debate with Donald Trump, perhaps the most arresting thing he said was (to his constantly interrupting opponent) ""Keep yappin', man.""
He is, it is true, known for gaffes, though these are often overstated. Competing with Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in 2007-08, Mr Biden praised his future boss as ""the first mainstream African-American"" to run for the presidency, ""who is articulate and bright and clean"". (A gap before ""who"" made clear that he did not mean previous African-American candidates lacked cleanliness, just that they had been less ""mainstream"".) While vice-president, he stood just a bit too close to a microphone as he said ""This is a big fucking deal"" into Mr Obama's ear at the signing ceremony for their health-care reform. He once asked a wheelchair-bound state senator to stand and be recognised.
These bloopers give the impression of a mouth running faster than a brain. Mr Obama was famous for long, thoughtful pauses; not so Mr Biden. His campaign speeches, like his questions as a longtime Senate committee chairman, tended to ramble. He once mystifyingly called a young student who asked a tough question a ""lying, dog-faced pony soldier"". Accused of corruption by a voter in Iowa, a bit of hotheaded ""Diamond Joe"" came out: he called the man a ""damn liar"" and challenged him to a press-up contest. And he mused that, were they in high school, he would ""beat the hell"" out of Mr Trump.
Instead, he beat him in politics, with words rather than fists. As things turned out, the contrasting styles of his predecessors may have made Mr Biden's deeply prosaic register an asset after all.
Receiving his party's nomination in 2008, Mr Obama said future generations might remember the occasion as ""the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal"". His high-flown rhetoric raised expectations to messianic levels. Dashed hopes led many voters to look for someone who sounded as little like a politician as possible. In 2016 that meant a political novice who eschewed focusgrouped formulations in favour of provocative, often vulgar tirades. Not only did voters not mind; Mr Trump's outrageous style was hugely effective. His vernacular delivery implied that he was a real boss, not a backslapping hack, with unique skills to get things done. But in office his coarseness turned some voters off, even as it thrilled others.
All that makes this an ideal time for Average Joe, for whom being able to talk fluidly at all was a hard-won achievement. Mr Biden grew up with a severe stutter, which he overcame as a young man. In one of the most touching scenes of his campaign, he told a boy who stutters, ""Don't let it define you. You are smart as hell."" Mr Biden took the boy's number and called him with some tips that had helped him; later the boy spoke to the Democratic National Convention.
Even careful presidents make gaffes under constant scrutiny. In office, Mr Biden will no doubt give comics plenty of material to sharpen their impersonations. But if he gets tongue-tied or says the wrong thing every now and then, well, so do most people. After 12 years of extraordinary political speech, Americans may be ready for a president who sounds like them."

LESS THAN a year after covid-19 spread across the world, scientists have produced several vaccines that may offer high immunity. But mass inoculation is months away. Until then people must contain the virus by wearing masks, travelling less and limiting contact with other households.
Politicians who thought their citizens would stop socialising of their own accord have been disappointed. America's daily deaths are near record highs as the virus runs amok. Europe's cases surged in October, causing 11 governments to reimpose national stay-at-home orders. They hope these lockdowns will reduce infections to manageable levels for Christmas. But after a grim spring, they must worry that people will be less compliant this time around.
Google's smartphone data confirm that Europe's latest restrictions have had less impact on daily life. In March the average number of trips-to places such as supermarkets, restaurants, transport hubs and offices-fell to 35% of the level in January. After rebounding to 83% by the time of the latest lockdowns, mobility has now dropped only to 68%. This smaller effect could be caused both by more flexible rules and less enthusiasm for obeying them.
Yet these less stringent lockdowns are still working. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's estimates of R-the average number of new people who catch the virus from each infected person-are dropping. In European countries that enacted second lockdowns, R fell from an average of 1.1 in the week before the new restrictions to 0.9 in the week after. That small change makes a big difference. Over four weeks, it would mean new infections falling by 21%, rather than rising by 36%.
For 334 local authorities in England and Wales (akin to America's counties), we have also calculated which aspects of lockdowns matter most. We combined estimates of R from Imperial College London with travel records from Teralytics, a Swiss technology firm, and Google's smartphone data. Then we used mediation analysis, a statistical technique, to disentangle the effects of different types of mobility.
We found two ways that lockdowns suppress R. First, reducing trips to work helps, as do fewer outings to restaurants, bars and shops, though the effect of those leisure settings may vary a lot. (Usage of parks or public transport had no impact, perhaps because visitors are outside or wearing masks.) Second, lockdowns deter people from travelling to other local authorities. This is probably the most important factor in decreasing r overall.
This is all good news. Looser lockdowns cost less than total closures. And when governments reopen businesses, they can mitigate extra mingling among customers by urging them to stay in their local areas, for now. That is the best way to get the virus under control before Christmas."

CONSIDERING her life, as she most liked to, from the sprawling stone stables of Trefan Morys in north Wales among trees, owls and waters, Jan Morris divided it into three parts. For the first 35 years she had been James Morris, a soldier and an intrepid reporter. For a decade after that, as she took the hormone pills that gradually lightened and rejuvenated her, she was an androgynous creature, untethered and strange. Then, from 1972 and the procedure in Casablanca that permanently altered her body, she was herself.
James, however, had not gone anywhere. He was still about: the little lad with his precious telescope already trained on the blue mountains of Wales, the Christ Church choirboy piping in his white and scarlet, the intelligence officer rattling in jeeps through the deserts of Arabia, the craver for fire, salt and laughter as a writer for the Manchester Guardian. He was a handsome man, tall, lean and sinewy, exulting as young men could in the full, controlled power of his body. In 1953, when he was working for the Times, he accompanied Sir Edmund Hillary's Everest expedition (though he had never climbed a mountain before) and brought back the world scoop that the peak had been conquered. That slithering, bounding descent to the telegraph office, forcing his way down a glacier as if sparks flew from him, and the sending of the message in ""skulldug"" code to London in time for the queen's coronation, was the best memory of his life, and hers.
Of the androgynous years there was less to report. Commissions flooded in, incessant travelling went on, books were written and much praised. But the work was now freelance, not for any employer, and despite marriage and children a sense of tormented solitude descended. Fame seemed repugnant, as part of maleness. In Africa or India people inquired whether this visitor was a man, a woman, or some holy hermaphrodite. The body became disturbing and could not be shown, except to a small deserted lake high in the Welsh hills that embraced it with no questions.
And then, at last, came the triumphant liberation of being a woman, as she had known she should be since toddlerhood. The ""Why?"" was unimportant, though it struck her as only common sense or, at least, good taste: gentleness against force, give more than take, yielding and accepting rather than pushing and initiating. The subtle subjection, the condescension and assumed inferiority, were a small price to pay. The prurient curiosity of her legions of readers could be satisfied with a book about it all, called ""Conundrum"", in 1974. Then she could resume her life.
For what had really changed? Almost nothing. Her dispositions were as they had always been: a liking for cats and smart cars, moules and white wine, for speed, wind and great spaces, for the role of the loner and onlooker, and romanticism in the bones. The army still attracted her for its dash, courage, self-discipline and swagger. When she took a walk for exercise, she marched like a soldier. She remained married (though, between 1972 and 2008, formally divorced because illegal), to Elizabeth, with an intensity of love different from all others. They lived surrounded by the intimate presence of thousands of books, to which she chatted as friends.
The writing went on seamlessly, every day and with any implement available, navigating the wonderful, inexhaustible, shimmering sea of words. Through the 1970s she continued and completed a wistful three-volume history of the decline of the British Empire, ""Pax Britannica"", her best work she thought, which had been started in the spirit of a Roman centurion witnessing the decline of Rome. She kept up the irresistible habit of visiting every city greater than Bucharest, barging in uninvited and ignorant with the same voracious cheek to wander and record impressions: sparkling Manhattan, where Fred Astaire might dance at any moment down Fifth Avenue; Sydney, vacuous and frigid at the soul; Beirut, a Carmen among cities, tossing its curls and flouncing its skirts; Cairo, with its smell of unrefined petrol, dust, jasmine and new concrete. She retained the old love of shifting places, not quite fixed, such as name-changing Trieste and St Petersburg, crossed by both snow-light and sea-light. Above all, she kept Venice. To drift on inky waters in a gondola at night, slightly drunk, watching the pale buildings pass, was a sublimation as good as sexual. In those years of sexual misery, it was compensation.
But far too much was made of organs. Gender was distinct from sex, a more fundamental reality, based not in the loins so much as in head and heart. It was an inner music, a light and shade. For her ""the conundrum thing"" was less a matter of science than a divine allegory, a union of selves. One had absorbed the other, and nothing was discarded. As with writing about a place, which was also a search for unity of a sort, hard facts were less important than feeling, mood and even imagination. These produced a subtler, personal truth. Even the British Empire was evoked in looks, smells and sensations, the dates left vague. Her first drafts were usually stream-of-consciousness, letting it all go through; her second inserted the more sober, conscious self, often, she thought, wrongly.
She attributed her mystical feelings largely to Wales, the land of her fathers, damp, demanding and bemusing as she knew it to be, but also worked through with allusions, lore and magic and underpinned by kindness. In ""The Matter of Wales"" she declared herself a firm nationalist, though the softness and humour of England pleased her. Something of Wales, she wrote, lurked and smiled behind all her writings, for she owned it, every lichened boulder, every spin of the pit wheel, like all her places. She was one with the peasants, the miners, the mythmakers and the shape-changers.
There at Trefan Morys, on the banks of the river Dwyfor that ran, loudly through weed and moss, round a tiny island where her ashes would be scattered, she planned to spend most of the afterlife wandering with Elizabeth. She foresaw the odd excursion, though, to the seafront at Trieste, the city that always looked over its shoulder at the tangled illusions and yearnings of the past, to toast its sweet melancholy with a glass of sparkling wine."

Zoom, one of the chief beneficiaries from the turn to remote working, reported that revenue soared by 367% in its latest quarter, year on year, to $777m.

Airbnb said it would price its forthcoming IPO at between $44 and $50 a share, which would value it at up to $35bn. That is double a private estimate from earlier this year, when the home-rental firm was hit by lockdowns. It has since bounced back, as people seek remote dwellings either to work in or to get away from it all. The pandemic ""has accelerated the ability to live anywhere"" Airbnb recently said.
China followed through with its threat to impose tariffs of between 107% and 212% on Australian wine imports. China is the biggest market for Aussie wineries. Beijing says the tariffs are an anti-dumping measure to stop Australian imports damaging the domestic wine industry, but it has slapped tariffs on other Australian goods this year, as the countries' diplomatic relations have worsened.

It forecasts the world economy will grow by around 4% in both 2021 and 2022. The recovery will be uneven, however. China and other non-OECD countries will chalk up faster growth rates than developed ones.
In Britain, the pandemic pushed more long-struggling retailers to the wall. Arcadia, which owns a string of highstreet clothing brands, such as Topshop and Burton, fell into administration. That led the firm behind a potential rescue of Debenhams to pull out of its deal; the department-store chain now faces liquidation. The collapse of both retailers puts 25,000 jobs at risk.

AROUND THE world the mood is shifting. Xi Jinping has adopted a target to cut China's net carbon emissions to zero by 2060. Under Joe Biden, America will rejoin the Paris agreement, which it adopted five years ago. In the financial markets cleanenergy firms are all the rage. This month Tesla will join the s&p 500 share index-as one its largest members.
Remarkably, in a realm where words are cheap, there has been action, too. In America and Europe the consumption of coal, the largest source of greenhouse gases, has fallen by 34% since 2009. The International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental body, reckons that global use will never surpass its pre-covid peak.
Yet coal still accounts for around 27% of the raw energy used to power everything from cars to electric grids. Unlike natural gas and oil, it is concentrated carbon, and thus it accounts for a staggering 39% of annual emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels (see Briefing). If global emissions are to fall far enough, fast enough, the task now is to double down on the West's success and repeat it in Asia. It will not be easy.
Coal came of age in the Industrial Revolution. In the rich world its use in furnaces and boilers peaked in the 1930s and faded as cleaner fuels became available. Consumption in the West has recently collapsed. In Britain the last coal-fired power plants could close as soon as 2022. Peabody Energy, a big American coal miner, has warned that it may go bankrupt for the second time in five years.
Although carbon prices accelerated the shift in Europe, the Trump administration has favoured America's coal industry with deregulation and political support-and still it has declined. One reason is competition from cheap natural gas produced in America by fracking. Tax credits and subsidies have prompted renewables to scale up, which has in turn helped drive down their costs. Solar farms and onshore wind are now the cheapest source of new electricity for at least two-thirds of the world's population, says BloombergNEF, a data group. As coal faces cleaner rivals and the prospect of more regulation, banks and investors are turning away, raising coal's cost of capital.
This is a victory, but only a partial one. In the past decade, as Europe has turned against coal, consumption in Asia has grown by a quarter. The continent now accounts for 77% of all coal use. China alone burns more than two-thirds of that, followed by India. Coal dominates in some medium-sized, fast-growing economies, including Indonesia and Vietnam.
If the aim is to limit global temperature rises to 2°C above preindustrial levels, it is no good waiting for Asia's appetite for coal to fade. New plants are still being built. Many completed ones are not yet fully utilised and still have decades of life in them. Nor is it enough to expect a solution from ""clean coal"" technologies, which aim to capture and store emissions as they are released. They may help deal with pollution from industrial uses, such as steelmaking, but they are too expensive for power generation.
Hence Asia needs new policies to kick its coal habit, and soon. The goal should be to stop new coal-fired power plants being built and to retire existing ones. Some countries have taken a first step, by imposing new targets and bans. The Philippines has declared a moratorium on new plants; Japan and Bangladesh are slowing construction, too. China's new five-year-plan, which will be published next year, may limit coal use. It should set its cap at current levels, so that the decline can start immediately.
If targets are to be credible, Asian countries must tackle deeper problems. The strategy that worked in Europe and America will get them only so far, because the mining firms, power stations, equipment-makers and the banks that finance them are often state-controlled. Market forces and carbon taxes, which use price signals to change incentives, are therefore less effective. And coal politics is treacherous. The coal economy forms a nexus of employment, debt, tax revenues and exports. China has used its Belt and Road Initiative to sell both mining machinery and power plants. Across the region, local governments depend on coal for revenues. Many will defend it ferociously.
One step in fighting regional lobbies is to redesign power systems so that renewables can compete fairly and incentives work. Most renewables provide only intermittent power, because the weather is changeable. National smart grids can mitigate this by connecting different regions. Too many of Asia's electricity systems muffle market signals because they are locked into legacy long-term supply contracts with coal firms, and because they are riddled with opaque subsidies and price caps. Removing these so that markets and taxes work better will let renewable power undercut coal.
The other step is to compensate losers. The lesson from destitute mining towns in south Wales and West Virginia is that job losses store up political tensions. Coal India, the national mining colossus, has 270,000 workers. From Shanxi province in China to Jharkhand in India, local governments will need fiscal transfers to help rebalance their economies. Banks may need to be recapitalised: China's state lenders may have up to $itrn at stake.
Europe and America have shown that King Coal can be dethroned, but they cannot be bystanders as Asia works to complete the revolution. Coal powered the West's development. In 2019 coal consumption per person in India was less than half that in America. It is in Asia's long-term interests to topple coal, but the short-term political and economic costs are large enough that action may be too slow. If politicians in Europe and America are serious about fighting global warming, they must work harder to depress coal elsewhere. That includes honouring prior promises to help developing countries deal with climate change.
Ultimately, though, the responsibility will lie with Asia itself. And the good news is that it is overwhelmingly in Asia's interest to do so. Its people, infrastructure and agriculture are dangerously exposed to the droughts, flooding, storms and rising sea levels caused by climate change. A growing middle class yearns for their governments to clean up Asia's choking metropolises. And renewable energy offers a path to cheaper power, generated at home, as well as a source of industrial employment and innovation. Coal's days are numbered. The sooner it is consigned to museums and history books, the better. *"

The world's most complex and immovable industry has been reinventing itself
VAST, BUREAUCRATIC and amorphous, health care has long been cautious about change. However, the biggest emergency in decades has caused a revolution. From laboratories to operating theatres, the industry's metabolism has soared, as medical workers have scrambled to help the sick. Hastily and often successfully, they have improvised with new technologies. Their creativity holds the promise of a new era of innovation that will lower costs, boost access for the poor and improve treatment. But to sustain it, governments must stop powerful lobbies from blocking the innovation surge when the pandemic abates.
Covid-19 has led to the spectacular development of vaccines using novel mRNA technologies. But there have also been countless smaller miracles as health workers have experimented to save lives (see Britain section). Obsolete iT-procurement rules have been binned and video-calls and voice-transcription software adopted. Machines are being maintained remotely by their makers. With patients stuck at home, doctors have rushed to adopt digital monitoring of those recovering from heart attacks. Organisational silos have been dismantled. All this has taken place alongside a boom in venture-capital-raising for medical innovation: $8bn worldwide in the most recent quarter, double the figure from a year earlier. jd Health, a Chinese digital-medi- cine star, has just listed in Hong Kong (see Business section).
More innovation is needed. Global health spending accounts for 5% of gdp in poor countries, 9% in rich ones and 17% in America. The industry employs over 200m people and generates more than $300bn of profits a year. But as well as being risk-averse, it is insulated from change. Patients may not know which treatments are effective. The need to pool risk among many people creates administrative leviathans, typically national-health schemes in Europe, or insurers in America and some emerging economies. Complex rules enable firms to extract high profits.
The result is that productivity growth has been sluggish. High costs mean that many people in the developing world lack access to health care. Low efficiency may cause a fiscal crisis in some rich countries over the next two decades, as ageing populations force medical bills up further.
The pandemic helped show what is possible, partly because it got people to put aside their caution. Remote medical consultation and monitoring can lower costs and increase access. The share of remote visits at the Mayo Clinic, an American health provider, rose from 4% before the pandemic to 85% at the peak. Sehat Kahani, a Pakistani firm, has helped female remote doctors treat the poor in a socially conservative society. Ping An Good Doctor, a Chinese portal, had 1.1bn visits during the height of the pandemic there.
A surge in online pharmacy would increase competition. On November 17th Amazon announced its entry into the field, which promises to disrupt America's industry dominated by big pharma and middlemen. That is just the start. Data-rich diagnosis could help specialists in routine analysis of, say, medical scans such as x-rays. A new generation of continuous glucose monitors for diabetics benefits from recent improvements in sensors. In time artificial intelligence will lead to drug innovations. This week DeepMind, an ai laboratory, announced a breakthrough in the analysis of proteins (see Science section).
Many of these trends should improve efficiency directly- with lower office rents, or the allocation of doctors in real time to rural areas where surgeries are scarce. But they are also likely to unleash a burst of competition and continuous improvement. More data will make it simpler to judge which treatments are most effective, the holy grail of medicine. Personal-health monitoring will mean that treatment becomes more preventive rather than reactive. And with more information, patients can make better decisions.
Governments can do their bit to help. Big health-care firms, such as insurers, and state-run health schemes, should be eager to recognise new digital services and pay for them. Germany and China have passed laws or new rules urging reimbursements of online services, for example. The evaluation of digital services for efficacy should be faster. America's Food and Drug Administration has modernised its approval process for apps.
The other priority for governments is to build a system for the flow of health-care data. Individuals should have control over their records and grant permission to providers to gain access to them. India is creating national health ids that will aim to combine privacy with mass data. Around the world hundreds of millions of medical records need to be anonymised and aggregated more efficiently so that researchers can scour data sets for patterns.
A rare chance to improve the quality of health care and lower its costs may vanish by the end of 2021. Exhausted health-care workers may prefer a rest to a revolution. Some of today's medtech startups will flop, prompting a backlash. A few big tech firms may try to monopolise pools of data. And the industry's powerful lobbies will try to lock out competitors. Health care is not a field where you set out to learn from your mistakes. Yet the pandemic has revealed that the industry became too used to being careful. It has redefined what is possible. *"

Having stolen an election, Belarus's government is torturing those who object
GREEN MEANS humiliation, which may involve sexual abuse or the threat of rape. It is reserved for young men sporting dreadlocks, long hair or piercings. Yellow paint, when daubed on those who ask too many questions or argue with riot police, spells a beating. Those who try to run away or resist arrest are sprayed with red paint and subjected to torture so severe that it could leave them disabled for life.
Colour-coding prisoners is standard practice in Belarus, a European country that has been ruled by Alexander Lukashenko for the past 26 years. What is new is that since August, when Mr Lukashenko declared himself president again after another fraudulent election, his goons have used colour codes to systematise the brutalisation of thousands of peaceful protesters, according to Nash Dom, a Belarusian ngo.
The colour codes testify to the scale both of state terror and of the national resistance movement. Over the past four months more than 30,000 people have been detained, and some 4,000 have alleged they have been tortured. Some have been stripped naked, shot with rubber bullets from close range, sodomised with truncheons or driven through a corridor of thugs for more beatings. Victims are paraded and humiliated on state television. Terrified into submission, some are forced to apologise on air for imaginary crimes.
Mr Lukashenko has so far stopped short of opening fire on demonstrators. However, several have been killed. The latest, 31year-old Roman Bondarenko, a military veteran and children's art teacher, was reportedly bludgeoned to death for trying to stop Mr Lukashenko's thugs from taking down red and white ribbons, a symbol of national resistance. A doctor who tried to save him, and who contradicted the official story that Mr Bondarenko was drunk, was arrested and forced to recant on camera.
That such abuse can take place in a country which borders the European Union is a blot on the continent's reputation. Yet the response from the eu's key member states has been limp. Many European leaders, including Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, have made the symbolic gesture of meeting Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the probable true winner of the rigged election in August, who has since then been forced into exile (see Europe section). But sanctions against the Belarusian regime have been limited to a travel ban and an asset freeze for a few named officials, including Mr Lukashenko. In a slap to the Belarusian people, Israel has sent its ambassador to present Mr Lukashenko with his credentials.
The main reason for European inaction and Mr Lukashenko's staying power is Russia, which has forged a kind of political union with Belarus. Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, has warned the West against meddling in what he claims as his backyard. After his invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014, few Western leaders are willing to wade in. But there are some simple steps that they could and should take, preferably together.
To start with, they should stop buying chemicals, petrol and metal from Belarus's stateowned firms and impose sanctions on anyone who does. More important, they should offer the prospect of justice to the people of Belarus and punishment to their torturers. They should do so not just for the sake of Belarusians but also to honour their own values. Next year, when Joe Biden is president of the United States, he should do the same.
Violence is carried out not by abstract agencies, but by specific people who serve in them and hide their faces beneath balaclavas. Those agencies should be designated for what they areorgans of terror. Western governments should take a cue from Lithuania and Poland in collecting evidence and setting up investigations into crimes against humanity. They should apply the principle of universal jurisdiction in cases of torture. Standing up for human rights in Belarus is not interference. It is the duty of every self-respecting country."

Joe Biden should drive a hard bargain with the mullahs
FOR THE past four years Iran's enemies in the Middle East have had a friend in the White House. President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the region's problems, sold arms to Israel and Arab states, and pulled America out of the deal that saw Iran limit its nuclear programme and agree to inspections in return for the lifting of international sanctions. In November Mr Trump retweeted news of the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of Iran's past nuclear-weapons programme.
The killing appears to have been the work of Israel, which has a history of bumping off Iranian nuclear scientists. With the clock ticking on the Trump administration, it may have been an attempt to scorch the earth before Joe Biden takes over. When it comes to Iran, Mr Biden prefers statecraft to sanctions and talks to targeted killings. He promises to return to the nuclear deal if Iran, which began breaching parts of it last year, moves back into compliance (see Middle East & Africa section).
More diplomacy would certainly be welcome. Mr Trump's policy of ""maximum pressure"" has hurt Iran by cutting it off from the world economy-but the administration never seriously pursued a new deal. Iran is now closer to a bomb than it was at the start of Mr Trump's term. Although covert operations may set Iran's nuclear programme back, negotiations hold out the promise of a more lasting solution. Before Mr Biden jumps back into the nuclear deal, however, he should consider how things have changed since it was signed in 2015.
Start in the Gulf. The region has long lived under an American security umbrella. Yet when Iran carried out a series of attacks, including missile strikes, Mr Trump barely stirred. That not only raised doubts about American deterrence; it also highlighted a flaw in the nuclear deal, which says little about Iran's missile programme and regional aggression. Such concerns have brought Israel and the Gulf states together. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have normalised relations with Israel, which is also working with Saudi Arabia. As the mullahs step up their nuclear activity, this anti-Iran axis is growing bolder. Israel may be behind several covert attacks inside Iran this year.
Things are also different in Iran. Five years ago Barack Obama's team dealt with a pragmatic administration there. But the pragmatists have been discredited by the failure of the nuclear deal to bring economic benefits. Hardliners won parliamentary elections this year and one may win the presidential election in June. Iran's response to the killing of Mr Fakhrizadeh highlights the tug-of-war between the camps. Parliament approved plans to stray further from the nuclear deal and kick out international inspectors. Hassan Rouhani, the relatively moderate president, opposes the bill.
All this complicates Mr Biden's effort to turn back the clock. But America's position has changed, too. The new administration may not like how Mr Trump and his team have handled Iran, but they have bequeathed it an extensive sanctions regime. Iran's gdp fell by 5.4% in 2018 and 6.5% in 2019, and it is expected to fall again this year. The value of the Iranian rial has collapsed. The annual rate of inflation is around 30%. Although the ruling elite have found ways around sanctions, ordinary people are hurting. Their protests are put down by ruthless security men, but Iran's clerical rulers are nervous.
Were Mr Biden to jump back into the nuclear deal quickly, it would mean lifting the sharpest sanctions and giving up much of this leverage. That would be a mistake. The president-elect says he wants to re-establish trust with America's allies, but he will do that by negotiating competently, not by rolling over. Although he is unlikely to satisfy Israel, Saudi Arabia or Republicans, he should use his leverage to wring more out of Iran.
Mr Biden's priority should be to extend the original accord, which expires over the next decade. Iran's leaders appear open to the suggestion. They are less keen to discuss missiles, Iran's principal means of deterrence. But Mr Biden should demand that they forswear long-range rocket launches and the transfer of missiles to regional proxies. In return he could gradually ease Iran's economic pain and throw in sweeteners, such as access to dollars and more civilian nuclear co-operation.
There are steps Mr Biden can take in the meantime to lower tensions with Iran, such as lifting Mr Trump's more symbolic sanctions. But he should drive a hard bargain with the mullahs. He is in a position to negotiate a broader, longer-lasting deal with Iran. He should take advantage of it."

Yet a television series that fictionalises reality is more truthful than the story the royals sold
I'm struggling to find any redeeming features in these peoIple at all,"" says Margaret Thatcher to her husband Denis in the course of a visit to Balmoral Castle, where the Thatchers are snubbed, humiliated and forced to play an after-dinner game called Ibble Dibble in which players smear their faces with burnt cork while getting drunk. Oliver Dowden, Britain's culture secretary, takes a similar view of the portrayal of the Royal Family in ""The Crown"". He believes that the real royals have been traduced by Netflix, which makes the drama, and has demanded that the company issue a health warning before future episodes, pointing out that the programme is fiction.
It seems odd that a government led by a man who is writing a book on Shakespeare should insist on historical accuracy in drama. Boris Johnson has not been heard complaining that ""Richard III"" libels a supposedly non-nepoticidal monarch. All drama that involves real people is, to some extent, fiction: when Charles and Diana stared into each other's eyes and realised it was over, no one else was in the room where it happened. If those being portrayed are dead, decently behaved and unimportant, nobody cares what lines script writers make up for them. But if they are alive, adulterous and the heir to the throne, things are bound to get sticky.
It is not surprising, then, that the release of the latest episodes has been accompanied by the sound of remote controls ricocheting off Home County walls. Conservatives are furious because their pin-up, Margaret Thatcher, appears as a rasping termagant determined to spill the blood of Argentines and rub the noses of the poor in the dirt. The royals' friends and flunkeys are outraged that the Windsors are portrayed as cold-hearted bullies who drive Diana to bulimia. The series, they claim, is untrue, unfair and will harm the monarchy.
If the monarchy is so vulnerable that a man pretending to be Prince Charles saying mean things to a woman pretending to be his wife damages it gravely, then the institution has probably outlived its usefulness. Famous people are often portrayed in ways they do not like, but that is one of the costs of free speech. If they feel strongly enough about it, they can sue; but Netflix's lawyers are probably not sitting by the phone.
The most interesting charge is of untruth. Certainly, ""The Crown"" distorts chronology and invents events. Prince Philip was not estranged from his mother. The queen did not visit Churchill on his deathbed. The row between Lord Mountbatten and Prince Charles before the prince's mentor is blown up by the ira is, so far as anybody knows, made up. Yet the monarchy, too, is a purveyor of fiction. ""Richard III"" was propaganda written by a Tudor toady to justify the overthrow of the previous regime. The Windsors constructed their own happyfamily story, which turned out to be less true than the fictionalised tale of dysfunction and despair. And, all in all, they do not come badly out of ""The Crown"". Its theme is the conflict between duty and personal fulfilment, which causes pain to cascade down from generation to generation. That is no fiction.
Since a government wedded to free speech is unlikely to haul Netflix's chief executive to the Tower of London for ignoring Mr Dowden, the intervention should be read as mere virtue-signalling to conservative Britons. Still, the government's concern for veracity is welcome. Perhaps in future Mr Johnson will pay closer attention to the truth than he did when heading a campaign to leave the European Union which claimed that Brexit would save the country £35om a week, or when he said over a year ago that a trade deal was ""oven-ready"". Those lies could lead to a geopolitical divorce far messier than the Windsors'."

You warned of the dire implications of America withdrawing from Afghanistan (""Leaving too soon"", November 21st). Certainly, the parallels with the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and the eventual collapse of the Najibullah regime are uncomfortable. However, it was not the withdrawal of Soviet combat troops that brought about the collapse, but the ending of Russia's subsidies in 1992.
Other pivotal moments in Afghanistan's history are also linked to the withdrawal of subsidies, from the rivalries between Shah Shujah and Dost Mohammad in the early 19 th century, culminating in the first Anglo-Afghan war, to arguments over military pay in 1879, which led to the murder of the British envoy, and through to post-1918, when Britain cut its subsidy. There is a pattern here. Intimately linked to the historic, systemic weakness of the Afghan state and its inability to raise taxes, the government is beholden to those who subsidise it. When the money runs out, it fails.
The key to securing Afghanistan's future is to keep the government financially afloat. nato has promised that funds will be provided until 2024. That is a start, but 2024 too closely matches the postSoviet trajectory to be comfortable. Instead, our commitment should be as open as our military one has been. That may give a chance for the post-Taliban generation to take power and for the country's economy to flower.

Hong Kong's legislature
You reported that four legislators in Hong Kong were disqualified from office (""Leaving in despair"", November 14th). What you did not say is that each of the four had earlier been barred from running for re-election by the returning officers. It was found they had not genuinely upheld the Basic Law and honoured their pledge of allegiance to the Special Administrative Region, which is required under Article 104.
As the elections to the Legislative Council were postponed in September for a year because of the pandemic, a decision was made by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the highest organ of state power. The logic is simple. People not qualified to contest the election should not be allowed to continue to serve as legislators in the current extended Legco.
The Special Administrative Region government is not targeting any member of the Legco. Nor are we suppressing political parties or silencing dissenting views. There is no question of the Legco becoming a ""rubber stamp"" body.
Our rules relating to the behaviour of public officers follow international norms. In Britain, members of Parliament must take an oath of allegiance to the crown before assuming office. In America members of Congress must swear to support and defend the constitution.
It is regrettable that 15 lawmakers subsequently chose to resign from the Legco. For them to abandon their monitoring role in providing checks and balances for the government is an irresponsible act that serves the interests of no one.

Political diversity
It is correct and reasonable to suggest that the structure of America's electoral college is disadvantageous to the Democrats because of the current geographical distribution of the party's supporters (""City v hills"", November 14th). But there are pros and cons in all democratic systems, and there are arguments for the characteristics that yield this particular outcome as well as arguments against. You recognise that Democrats tend to live in more ""diverse"" cities, but you also note that they tend to ""cluster"" to a greater extent. Crucially, it is the latter point that works against Democrats.
Diversity is a word we hear a lot of these days, often in support of laudable policies. But it involves including all parts of our society in the political conversation. If the Democrats cannot win rural votes, maybe they have a problem with diversity, which the electoralcollege voting system is merely helping point out.

J.M.W. Turner was another artist drawn to the evocative possibilities of the colour black, especially in his watercolours and paintings depicting the utilitarian grime of the Industrial Revolution (""Paint it black"", November 7th). Black is an essential element in his numerous images of steamboats, which marked early 19th-century technological progress. In ""Peace: Burial at Sea"", a hulking black steamship dominates the canvas, extruding heavy dark smoke; its blackened sails a sombre reference to the death of his colleague Sir David Wilkie (""I wish I had a colour to make them blacker,"" Turner said). The painting is on display as part of the Turner's Modern World exhibition at Tate Britain.

Pierre Soulages, who will be 101 this month, has devoted the second part of his very long life exclusively to the colour black, or rather non-colour, as he calls it. It is not so much black that interests him as the emotions elicited by the reflection of light off black paint and the intense sensorial and introspective experience this brings the viewer.
Unlike Anish Kapoor, who featured in your article, Mr Soulages does not resort to a new material but works on the texture of paint and pigment, matte or gloss, breaking up the surface with lines, contours, crevasses and forms that either absorb or reflect the light, thereby leading the viewer into another world, beyond black: outre-noir.
He has exhibited extensively outre-Atlantique, but perhaps not outre-Manche?

The world is finally burning less coal. It now faces the challenge of using almost none at all
Escalante, a coal-fired power station north of New Mexico's Zuñi mountains, is designed to produce some 250MW of electricity. Since August, however, it has produced none. Nor will it ever do so again.
The economic slump brought on by the covid-19 pandemic hit electricity demand around the world; non-renewable generators of all sorts reduced their output. But in many places the owners of coal-fired plants went further. Britain shut a third of its remaining coal-fired generating capacity in the first half of the year. In June Spain closed seven coal-fired stations from A Coruña to Córdoba, halving the country's coal capacity. Even in India, where coal generates nearly three-quarters of all electricity, the crown slipped a tiny bit: 300MW of Indian coal-fired power was retired in the first half of the year, according to Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit, and no new coal plants were built.
Consumption of coal has been on a slightly downward-sloping plateau for some years. But the capacity to burn it continued to increase, suggesting that things might change. Now the world's capacity to generate electricity from coal, too, has begun to drop (see chart 1 on next page). It is a significant milestone in the fight against climate change.
For the world to meet the ambitions it set itself at the Paris climate summit five years ago, that milestone needs to quickly vanish in the rear-view mirror: coal's decline needs to be made both steep and terminal. Coal-fired generation typically emits a third of a tonne of carbon dioxide for every megawatt-hour of electricity generated, around twice the emissions from a natural-gas plant. And although coal is used directly in some industrial processes, such as steelmaking, two-thirds of the stuff is burned to generate electricity-a role that many other technologies can fulfil more cleanly and even more cheaply.
Eliminating coal-fired electricity generation is thus a big but doable deal. Failing to get that deal done will see the world blaze past the Paris agreement's goal of keeping global warming since the Industrial Revolution ""well below"" 2°C.
A tale of three continents
The global peak in coal-fired capacity masks divergent stories in different countries. In the West, countries whose economic ascent was powered by coal and colonialism have been reducing their coal use for years and are shedding capacity with gusto. In South America and Africa- South Africa apart-coal has never been a big part of the energy mix. But Asia's largest countries depend overwhemingly on coal for the electricity their economies need, and they are still adding capacity.
Merely using the capacity they already have in place could easily push the world past the Paris limits. According to Dan Tong, a researcher at uc Irvine, coal plants operating and proposed in 2019 would, if operated to the end of their lives, emit 36obn tonnes of carbon dioxide-a total dominated by Asia.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ipcc) calculates that if the world is to have a decent chance of keeping warming below 1.5°C-the Paris agreement's stretch goal-it has to keep all future emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases down to the equivalent of 42obn-58obn tonnes of carbon dioxide. Today's coal plants could use up 60-85% of that budget on their own. The 2°C budget is more generous: i,i7obn-i,5oobn tonnes of carbon dioxide. But if existing coal plants use up between a quarter to a third of that allowance, the chances of staying within the bounds are slim.
Coal's decline in the West has been made possible by three mutually reinforc- ing developments: government policy, cheaper alternatives and restricted access to capital.
A growing number of governments have adopted policies designed to support clean energy and/or to eliminate coal. In 2013 Britain imposed a ""carbon-price floor"" on emissions by electricity generators which made coal a more expensive fuel. In 2015, in the run-up to Paris, the country mandated that coal-fired power in England, Wales and Scotland be phased out within a decade. Sixteen countries in the European Union either have a plan to phase out coal or are mulling one; even in those that do not, the carbon prices imposed by the eu's Emissions Trading Scheme have made burning coal more expensive in recent years. Some owners of coal-fired stations have chosen to shut them rather than make the investments necessary to comply with new environmental standards which enter into force next year.
They can do so because of the increasing availability of other sorts of power. In America the alternative which started coal's rout was a glut of gas created by the country's fracking boom. But at both federal and state level America has also supported renewables, as has Europe. And as those policies have increased the scale at which renewables operate, their costs have plunged. BloombergNEF, a data group, calculates that better technology and cheap capital mean that, if you divide the amount of energy that can be expected over the lifetime of a new solar farm in Germany by the cost of building and operating that farm, the ""levelised cost of electricity"" (lcoe) you get is lower than the marginal cost of electricity from a German coal plant. The same is true for onshore wind in Britain; BloombergNEF expects new American wind and solar to pass the threshold next year.
Banks have tightened finance for coal, too, wary of stricter regulation, stranded assets and continued pressure from green investors. In all, more than 100 financial institutions, from Credit Agricole to Sumitomi Mitsui, have set limits on the financing of coal projects, according to the Institute for Environmental Economics and Financial Analysis.
The effects have been impressive. In Britain the share of electricity generated by coal fell from 40% in 2013 to 2% in the first half of this year; the country now burns less coal than it did when the first coalfired power station was built in 1882. In the eu coal-fired power generation nearly halved between 2012 and 2019. In America President Donald Trump's promise that he would save the nation's ""beautiful"" coal industry proved as worthless as it was misguided. Coal-fired electricity generation was 20% lower in 2019 than in 2016, when he was elected. Peabody Energy, an American company that digs more coal than any other listed firm, warned in November that it might file for bankruptcy for the second time in five years.
This displacement needs to be speeded up and prolonged. The unique circumstances of 2020 have seen a 7% drop in coal consumption. According to a report published this week by the un and an international coalition of climate researchers, hitting the 2°C Paris target would require coal consumption to drop by the same amount every year for a decade. To hit the 1.5°C limit would require cuts of 11% year on year.
Prevaricate not
Those reductions would need to be even steeper were it not for the report's assumption that, by 2030, a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide produced in power stations and industrial plants will be captured on site and sequestered away underground, a process known as carbon capture and storage, or ccs. At the moment the world's ccs capacity is 4% of that. The technology could definitely be useful in steelworks and the like. Adding it to coal-fired electricity plants, though, is a pricey undertaking in which companies have very little experience. What is more, ccs has a long history as what Duncan McClaren of Lancaster University calls a ""technology of prevarication"". Holding the possibility of emissionsfree coal open but not realising it simply prolongs the status quo. Easier, cheaper and more definitive just to generate electricity by other means, such as renewables and nuclear.
Analysis like this has led Antonio Gutteres, the un secretary-general, to call for coal-fired electricity to be eliminated worldwide by 2040; he says the oecd, a club of rich countries, should get to zero by 2030. That would require a huge increase in effort. Japan currently envisages getting 26% of its electricity from coal in 2030. Germany plans to go on using coal until 2038. Though American coal use has fallen, its outright abolition will be staunchly opposed by some.
That said, the fall so far has been deeper and faster than most expected. Portugal, which had planned to be coal free by 2030, now looks like hitting that target in 2021. Perhaps political pressure, industrial momentum and business opportunity can speed things up elsewhere, too.
If Mr Gutteres's exhortation gives nonoecd countries a decade longer, it reflects the fact that many, especially in Asia, have a lot more to do. Asia is currently home to nearly 80% of coal consumption. Most of that-52% of the global total-takes place in one country: China. India, Asia's second-biggest market, consumes less than a quarter as much.
The growth in China's coal-fired generating capacity between 2000 and 2012 helped reshape the global economy and drive a 200% increase in Chinese gdp per person. It also nearly tripled the country's carbon-dioxide emissions, making it the largest emitter in the world. Its effects on air quality hastened millions of deaths.
Though new installations have never stopped, concerns over pollution and a glut of generating capacity have seen their rate decrease (see chart 2). The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, which oversees several large coal companies, has drafted plans to reduce coal capacity by one-quarter to one-third. Meanwhile alter- natives are on the rise. The government's spending on nuclear power handily outstrips that of any other country, and it has built up a massive renewables sector. The lcoe from new coal plants in China is already higher than that for solar and onshore wind farms, according to BloombergNEF. By the middle of the decade, the firm's analysts calculate, the lcoe of onshore wind and solar will be less than the marginal cost of operating existing coal plants (see chart 3).
Add to all this the country's recently promulgated target of carbon neutrality by 2060 and the future of coal in China might seem to be one of rapid withering. Yet coalplant construction shot up in 2019. And in the first five and a half months of 2020 provincial governments, keen to boost employment and economic growth, gave companies permission to add a further 17GW of new coal capacity. Various stateowned companies such as State Grid, the country's giant utility, China Electricity Council, the coal industry's main lobby, and some provincial governments want to see this growth sustained, even though a lot of current capacity is underutilised. One argument is that more electricity will be needed to supply demand from the electrification of heating and cars. Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a research institute, estimates that the China Electricity Council's statements imply a net increase in national coal capacity of 150-250GW.
Two eagerly awaited documents should reveal how much influence these pro-coal lobbies have. One is China's 14th five-year plan, which will be published early in 2021. The other is the new ""nationally determined contribution"", or NDC, required of the country under the Paris agreement-a list of its emission-reduction plans. If the five-year plan includes a near-term cap on coal capacity and the ndc calls for a peak in carbon emissions by 2025 it will signal a real turning away from coal (though perhaps not one fast enough for Mr Gutteres).
Other countries' coal
Chinese interests in new coal plants do not stop at the country's borders. Chinese-financed coal plants in other countries are on course to add 74GW of coal capacity between 2000 and 2033, according to Kevin Gallagher and his colleagues at Boston University. Chinese-funded foreign fossil-fuel plants-the vast majority of which burn coal-account for 314m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. That is nearly as much as the total annual emissions from Poland. The past decade has seen Chinese companies seek new opportunities for coal-plant construction in Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh, though Bangladesh and Vietnam have both started considering cuts in their plans for future coal capacity. If China limits coal at home, those concerns will work even harder to find growth elsewhere while the country's miners, too, look for new markets.
In Japan a similar dynamic is at play as the coal industry and its financiers look for new opportunities. This year the country set new limits on the financing of foreign coal plants, but loopholes remain. In November development banks from around the world issued a statement that they, too, would consider ways of reducing fossilfuel investments. But they resisted pressure from Mr Guterres and others to eliminate such investments entirely.
In India, as in China, significant new coal-fired capacity is planned on top of ambitious government targets for boosting solar power, the intermittency of which policymakers worry about. As India contemplates surging future demand for power, it has fewer alternatives to coal than China. The infrastructure for importing natural gas is underdeveloped and the fuel itself pricey; nuclear capacity is growing only slowly.
Ajay Mathur of the Energy & Resources Institute, in Delhi, argues that low utilisation rates of existing coal plants mean there is little rationale for further construction. But coal remains a political force. India's state-owned banks have financed much of its development. Power markets give coal-fired plants fixed payments, which lessen their incentives to work flat out but also make it harder for solar power to break in. In states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand jobs provided by Coal India Limited, the state-owned coal behemoth, are vital to the economy. And the government has recently authorised the development of new privately owned mines to reduce India's imports of foreign coal. With new miners come new constituencies to advocate for coal's future.
Similar political obstacles exist elsewhere. Fitch, a ratings agency, pointed out earlier this year that for all Indonesia's professed desire to limit pollution, its price caps on coal for domestic power generation are designed to keep coal-fired power cheap and promote economic growth. This limits competition from other fuels. Markets rigged for coal in countries with expanding energy needs will not necessarily last all that long. But the new coal capacity they bring into being may stick around for decades.
If it can be made politically feasible, redesigning electricity markets-easing rigid power-purchase agreements in India and Indonesia, for instance-can quickly boost renewables, and the batteries which smooth out their contributions. Carbon prices, too, make coal less competitive, and if designed in such a way that their benefits are visible to all-perhaps as dividends- they may offer a counterbalance to the concentrated political power of coal lobbies.
Perhaps most important, though, is support for those who will suffer from coal's demise. ""If you've got 30 years, one can plan a phase-down,"" says Mr Mathur. ""If you've got ten years, it is shutdowns and large financial transfers."" Mine closures must include support and retraining for affected workers. And there is scope for more creative assistance from the West-which has an interest in reducing coal emissions wherever they come from. The private arm of the Inter-American Development Bank recently helped a Chilean developer replace coal assets with wind turbines by means of a low-interest loan. The Sierra Club, Carbon Tracker and Rocky Mountain Institute, three green groups, suggest paying for reverse auctions in which developing-country coal-plant owners bid for debt-forgiveness to retire their coal stations early in favour of clean power. Only if alternatives are made attractive to incumbents can coal be crushed as speedily and completely as the world requires. *"

ASHFORD
Covid-19 has pushed the nhs to breaking point. It has also brought forth a wave of innovation
ACCORDING TO SHELAGH O'RIORDAN, a consultant in geriatric medicine, patients often experience the National Health Service (nhs) as a conveyor belt. ""You feel ill, you call this number. This number calls an ambulance. That ambulance tells you that you should go to hospital. You go to hospital. And then, if you're frail, you might not come out."" Her job, as she sees it, is to help people off the conveyor belt, and even on a quiet Sunday morning the telephone keeps ringing. Most calls are from nurses, paramedics or care-home workers. After a quick chat, each is given a set of instructions about the care of the patient to whom they are attending.
Dr O'Riordan set up this home-treatment service at the start of the pandemic, spurred by the need to keep patients out of hospital. The service offers acute care at home: diagnosing, assessing and looking after frail locals who wish to avoid hospital. Operating from a nondescript office on the edge of Ashford, a town of 75,000 in Kent, by the start of November it had treated more than 2,000 patients, around a third with covid-19. In the first wave of the pandemic it was unable to replicate the care received in hospitals, with people needing to head into an infirmary for oxygen or dexamethasone (a cheap but effective steroid). Both are now available at home.
The pandemic has put the nhs under unbearable strain, but it has also unleashed a wave of innovation. Freed from bureaucracy, and pressed by the need to keep patients out of hospital, medics and health officials have rethought how care is provided. In areas from remote care, to the use of technology, to breaking down silos across the health and social-care systems, covid-19 has accelerated policies that were making slow progress. As Jennifer Dixon of the Health Foundation, a think-tank, puts it: ""The safety blanket was thrown off.""
This presents an opportunity. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has drawn a comparison to the Great Fire of London in 1666, from which emerged the fire brigade, the first insurance firms, new water regulations and St Paul's Cathedral: ""Devastating shock can force people to find new and better ways of doing things."" Those in charge of the nhs now face two big questions. The first is which of these innovations make sense beyond the pandemic, and should become permanent features of the health service. The second is whether this burst of innovation can be sustained.
A senior nhs official calls the widespread adoption of remote care a ""move away from the dominant mode of medicine for the last 5,000 years"". Before the pandemic, 80% of appointments in primary care were face-to-face. Now they count for many fewer (see chart), and those who do see a general practitioner (gp) mostly have to go through triaging first. ""The change was arguably the most extensive and rapid the nhs has ever gone through,"" says Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care at the University of Oxford. Yet, despite the fears of many doctors, ""nothing very terrible happened"".
Remote medicine-which is now more commonly used for hospital outpatient ap- pointments, too-offers the hope of more convenient and possibly even cheaper care (see Business section). Pre-pandemic evaluations found it was as effective as in-person treatment for lots of illnesses. There is, though, a caveat. Before the pandemic, remote consultations tended to be done on patients who were considered ""very safe bets"", warns Dr Greenhalgh, who is leading a study to assess the impact of their widespread adoption.
Early in the pandemic, the health service signed contracts to provide Microsoft Teams and Attend Anywhere, a video-conferencing platform, to medics. It also offered reassurance on information-governance rules to those who used FaceTime, Skype or WhatsApp. In October 137,000 gp appointments took place online. Yet the same month 10m happened by telephone. ""We went to products that were readily available, not the most earth-shattering, transformative digital solutions,"" says Axel Heitmueller of Imperial College Health Partners, a non-profit consultancy that focuses on innovation. For the most part, existing care has been replicated (as far as possible) from a distance. In some places, though, it has been transformed.
A breath of fresh air
In north-west London, doctors had been installing a remote-monitoring system for people with high-risk diabetes. When the pandemic hit, the focus switched to covid-19. Patients in a serious condition, but short of hospital admission, were given a pulse oximeter (to measure blood-oxygen levels) and an app into which they entered its readings. ""We know people sat at home through the first wave feeling fine, but with their oxygen levels going down,"" says Sarah Elkin, a respiratory consultant. ""This is a way of picking up earlier the people who are becoming hypoxic.""
Remote monitoring of patients is one of the frontiers of digital medicine. The pandemic injected a new urgency into its introduction. The approval of the app used in north-west London took three weeks, instead of the six months or so that would be expected in normal times. Instead of weaving through a maze of committees, it went straight to those at the top who make the final decision. Covid-19 virtual wards have since sprung up in places from Manchester to South Tees, and nhsx, the health service's tech unit, has offered support to others who want to follow their lead. In northwest London, medics now plan to use remote monitoring to keep track of people recovering from heart attacks and with lung disease.
People focus on the whizzy technology required to do this. In fact, says one insider, the bigger challenge in schemes like these is changing work patterns and getting disparate parts of the health system to work together. For covid-19, gps referred patients to the remote-monitoring system, working alongside hospital consultants to decide when to admit patients. This teamwork was part of a broader shift during the first wave. Across the health service, staff, equipment and ideas were shared. Hospitals shuffled responsibilities, acting as part of wider networks rather than as standalone institutions.
Bob Klaber, a director at the hospital trust in north-west London, asks why it takes a pandemic for this to happen. In the popular imagination, the nhs is a monolithic organisation, powered by goodwill. In reality it is a tangled network of organisations, many of which have competing incentives, leading to behaviour that is, with varying degrees of intensity, territorial. Dr Klaber, who also works as a paediatrician, cites the payment-by-results mechanism as one obstacle: ""If I see a new patient 240 quid will come into the hospital. If a local gp who I know phones me up and says, 'I think we could probably clear this up in a five-minute conversation on the phone': no payment for that.""
The mechanism is part of the ""internal market"", which was introduced by Conservative governments in the early 1990s. This separates purchasers of services (mostly gps) from providers (mostly hospitals), which compete for contracts. Studies looking at its effectiveness have obtained mixed results, with none suggesting great success. In an age when rising numbers of (often elderly) patients have multiple health problems, and when the nhs is trying to focus on prevention rather than merely treatment, the bureaucracy and fragmentation it imposes is a problem.
Mr Hancock has said that health care must be ""based on the needs of the population, not the design of the institution"", to ensure the co-operation of the pandemic continues. In recent years the government has tried to circumvent the internal market, bringing together purchasers and providers in local areas to plan services for the whole population-an idea imported from America, Germany and Singapore.
Improvements have so far been modest. A recent paper by academics at the universities of Kent and Manchester looked at ""Vanguard sites"", which trialled the new approach from 2015 to 2018. It found that emergency admissions rose more slowly than elsewhere, but still increased, and that there was no significant difference in bed-occupancy rates. The nhs leadership thinks the solution is more integration; it hopes to match the financial and legal plumbing of the health service to this new reality. Accordingly, it has asked the government to introduce legislation to restructure the health service, either creating local health boards or adapting existing bodies to serve that purpose.
Along with the potential for the first major nhs legislation since 2012, next year is likely to be dominated by the need to shrink waiting lists, which ballooned during the pandemic. That places very different pressures on the health service from during the first wave, when non-urgent hospital admissions fell by around 70%. Spending has tightened and bureaucracy has reappeared. Mr Heitmueller, who formerly worked in the Cabinet Office, worries about where the spark for innovation will come from in the post-pandemic health service.
While the pace of change may slow, many of the changes will endure. Even over the summer, when the virus waned, the proportion of face-to-face appointments remained far lower than before the pandemic. Connections have been forged across the health system, and barriers broken. ""The nhs surprised itself by how quickly it did some major things,"" says Chris Hopson of nhs Providers, a representative group. ""One of the things that will stick is that sense of the possibility of much, much more rapid change."" With lengthy queues and tight public finances, ministers must hope he is right. *"

A court ruling upsets trans groups
In anglo-saxon countries, trans people have gained rights in the past few years. Those in Canada and some Australian states can be legally recognised as belonging to the gender of their choice, irrespective of whether they have had gender reassignment surgery. In America, the Equality Act, which Joe Biden has promised to sign, would have a similar effect. But in Britain there has been a push-back. In September, the government said it would not reform the Gender Recognition Act, which Theresa May, a former prime minister, had said she would change to allow gender selfidentification. And now a High Court ruling has upset trans-rights activists.
On December 1st, three judges ruled that the youth gender-identity clinic at the Tavistock Hospital in London was not upholding the law, which requires that children have a mature understanding of the consequences of hormone treatment before consenting to it. The ruling was part of a judicial review brought by Keira Bell (pictured), a 23-year-old woman who identified as a boy when she was younger, and was given puberty blockers at 16, then testosterone, then a double mastectomy. She later detransitioned. Ms Bell argued that she was too young to understand the implications, and that the protocol for giving the drugs did not have an adequate scientific basis. The court agreed, calling the treatment ""experimental"".
Last year 2,700 people were referred to the Tavistock's youth gender-identity clinic. Around 40-50% of them were put onto puberty blockers. The clinic argued that the drugs are safe and reversible. Ms Bell's lawyers produced a study showing that in 97% of cases they led on to further treatments such as cross-sex hormones and surgery. The court agreed that once on the pathway, ""it is extremely rare for a child to get off it"".
The clinic said it would pause putting under-age patients onto puberty blockers. Most future cases will be referred to the courts. Trans campaign groups were aggrieved. The ruling was ""shocking"", according to Nancy Kelley, head of Stonewall. ""Hormone blockers,"" she said, ""play a vital role in helping to alleviate the distress many trans young people experience and offer much-needed time...to explore their identity. Denying this vital support is not a neutral act and can be deeply harmful.""
Some feminist lobby groups, who believe that there is a conflict between trans rights and women's rights, are delighted. They maintain that mistaken beliefs about gender have led to children wrongly being put on the path to gender reassignment, as Ms Bell was, and that the court has cut through the ideology and got to the facts. Stephanie Davies-Arai of Transgender Trend, a campaigning group, points out that scientific studies that her group submitted to the court were accepted as evidence, while submissions from Stonewall and Mermaids, a trans support group, were denied because the evidence had either already been given or was irrelevant. The judgment is a victory for the trans activists' opponents; but there are more legal battles due next year. *"

Talks inch towards a last-minute deal-but it is not done yet
THE GOVERNMENT is urging businesses to step up preparations for the end of Britain's transition out of the European Union on December 31st. This week Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, announced the setting up of a new border operations centre, adding that significant change was coming with or without a trade deal. Yet many companies retorted that uncertainty over the negotiations made proper preparation all but impossible.
This week's talks in London have made some progress, yet the old gaps remain over fisheries and a level playing-field for competition. Officials suggest Boris Johnson now needs to intervene to seal a deal. The prime minister is under pressure, especially after a big backbench Tory revolt on December 1st against his new covid-19 tier system. But Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, sees little sign of early readiness to give more ground to the eu. And the mooted inclusion of more unilateral (and illegal) changes to the Northern Ireland provisions of the withdrawal treaty in next week's finance bill could upset the applecart again.
As repeated Brexit deadlines come and go, the timetable for ratifying a trade treaty that runs to some 800 pages (plus annexes) becomes ever tighter. Getting a deal through Westminster should not be hard even with another revolt by hardline Tories, because the Labour opposition is unlikely to vote it down if the alternative is no deal. But rushed approval by the eu is a lot more problematic.
All national governments must agree. Some may jib if there is not enough time for full legal scrutiny and translation. In a few countries, such as Finland, parliamentary approval is needed before a government signs. Some parliaments may also demand a say if the deal is ""mixed"", meaning it includes issues such as airline regulation or social security that fall within national not eu competence. But Georgina Wright of the Institute for Government, a think-tank, says lawyers in Brussels may still argue that the deal needs only eu approval. She also points to precedents for provisional application of trade deals pending any national ratifications later deemed necessary.
That is harder with the European Parliament, since its approval has always preceded a trade deal taking effect. Next week sees its last planned plenary meeting of the year. Two committees normally scrutinise and report on trade deals before they are voted on. Yet meps are well briefed on the Brexit trade talks, and are anxious not to be seen as an obstacle to a deal. They have already planned a remote session with a vote in the week of December 28th just in case.
Brexit's potential cost is becoming clearer. The government tried unsuccessfully to head off this week's backbench revolt by publishing a hasty economic-impact assessment of its covid-19 tiers. Yet Mr Johnson still refuses to offer a similar assessment of any Brexit trade deal (or of no deal). Fortunately the independent Office of Budget Responsibility has now done the job. It predicts a 4% long-term loss of output with a deal, and an extra cut in gdp of 2% next year with no deal. This echoes other forecasts and the Bank of England's conclusion that Brexit will cost more than the pandemic. And it will come on top of a poor outcome in 2020. The oecd has just downgraded its forecasts, putting Britain second-to-last among leading members, with an expected fall in gdp this year of 11.2%. That is an unhappy position in which to inflict further disruption. *"

PETERBOROUGH
Brexit did not cause eastern Europeans to flee. They just stopped coming
OLENA HRABOVENSKA, who owns several Polish food shops in Huntingdon and Peterborough, shudders to remember the Brexit referendum in 2016. The campaign to leave the eu had unleashed ugly prejudices. Cards about ""Polish vermin"" were posted through letterboxes. Her customers seemed despondent, asking: ""what's the point of being here if we're not appreciated?"" Soon afterwards, eastern Europeans' numbers started to decline, but not because they rushed for the exit.
Eight Baltic and eastern European countries joined the eu in 2004: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Many of their citizens moved to Britain, which, unlike most European countries, imposed no transitional controls. But according to the Labour Force Survey, the number of adults in England and Wales born in those countries has fallen from 1,139,000 in 2016-17 to 926,000 (see chart). Other data tell a similar story. Last year fewer than 17,000 babies were born to Polish women-down from almost 23,000 in 2015.
The Brexit vote caused sterling to fall, reducing the purchasing power of remittances sent from Britain. Two years later the government told people who wanted to settle to prove they had been mostly resident for five years in a row-a test that some found offputting. ""You are treated as a number,"" says Aga Dychton, a Polish immigrant who is now chairman of Watford borough council. Yet all Europeans face these problems. The number of French, German and Italian immigrants has not fallen much; nor has the number of Bulgarians and Romanians, who have been able to work in Britain since 2014.
The countries that joined the eu 16 years ago have changed in a way that makes Britain seem less attractive. Marius Vainauskar, who moved to Britain in 2005 to take a job sticking labels on vegetables, remembers that he used to feel rich when he went back to Lithuania. Today he has a better job, as a driving instructor, but no longer feels so flush. Over the past 16 years the average wage in Lithuania has risen from 41% of the British level to 61%, at purchasing-power parity. And many eastern Europeans are underemployed in Britain. The Oxford Migration Observatory, a think-tank, finds they have the lowest pay of any migrant group and are the most likely to be overqualified for the jobs they do.
Ruta Dalton, an accountant originally from Lithuania, suspects that Brexit itself persuaded few eastern Europeans to depart. Some have left-but most of them would have gone anyway, pulled back by family obligations or simply because they had saved as much money as they wanted to. The big change is that many fewer eastern Europeans are coming. Last year only 77,000 people from the 2004 accession countries received a British National Insurance number. In 2015, the year before the Brexit vote, 185,000 did so.
This is not exactly a ringing endorsement of the ""global Britain"" that Boris Johnson boasts about. But attracting eastern Europeans would be getting harder even if sterling and the economy were strong and Britain went easy on the immigration paperwork. A baby bust after the fall of the Iron Curtain and years of emigration means there are fewer potential migrants left in eastern Europe. The United Nations estimates that the number of 18-year-olds in Poland has fallen from 598,000 to 340,000 since 2005.
New customers
Some immigrants are still arriving in Lincoln Road, the traditional starting-off point for newcomers in Peterborough. Shops that once specialised in Polish food now sell Romanian products. And Petr Torak, a former police officer who now runs a community centre, says that Roma from the Czech Republic and Slovakia are settling in the area. Unlike the Poles and Lithuanians who came before, they are fleeing persecution as well as looking for jobs. He struggles to imagine them returning to their homelands.
Ms Hrabovenska's shops are doing fine for now. But, like a good businesswoman, she worries about the future. What will happen if Britain enters a prolonged economic slump and unemployment soars? If everyone ends up counting their pennies, she thinks, the eastern Europeans really will leave in a hurry. ""They can count pennies in their own country,"" she says."

Britain launches a new cyber-force of soldiers and spies
The head of America's Cyber Command, Paul Nakasone, is a four-star general whose chest is plastered in medals. The commander of Britain's National Cyber Force (ncf) is a bespectacled, middle-aged man in a beige blazer-a 20-year veteran of gchq, Britain's signals-intelligence service, whose name the government has asked to keep secret. Unassuming as he may be, his agency, responsible for offensive cyber-operations, now stands at the centre of a sweeping overhaul of British defence capabilities.
On November 19th Boris Johnson announced the biggest programme of investment in defence since the Thatcher era. The cash, an extra £6.5bn ($8.7bn) during this parliament over previous manifesto plans, reverses nearly a decade of military cuts and cements Britain's position as the second-largest military spender in nato, behind America, and the largest in Europe, with a budget of £46.5bn this year. It includes a tilt towards the seas and skies, with more spending on ships, a commitment to send an aircraft-carrier to Asia next year (with American marines aboard) and a Space Command to watch for threats to satellites.
The central theme, though, is technology. Britain will establish a new agency for artificial intelligence (ai). It will invest more in drones and lasers. And it will beef up cyber capabilities. That explains Mr Johnson's decision to avow the existence of the ncf, which has been quietly hacking away since the spring. The force brings under unified command for the first time personnel from gchq, the Ministry of Defence and mi6, Britain's foreign intelligence agency, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (dstl). The force is thought to number in the hundreds, with the aim of growing to 3,000 staff over the next decade. Adverts are up online.
The ncf's purpose is not to collect intelligence-gchq has done that since its inception-but to make things happen. That could include shutting down the communications of a terrorist group or disabling enemy air defences, but also something as simple as sending a message to dissuade someone from acting.
Such offensive cyber-activity is increasingly common, though most countries keep quiet about it. Britain broke its own silence in 2013, when Philip Hammond, the defence secretary at the time, said that Brit- ain was building a cyber ""strike"" capability. In 2017 Britain acknowledged it was ""routinely"" using offensive cyber against Islamic State, a terrorist group.
Acknowledging these offensive cyber campaigns was a cheap way of demonstrating counter-terrorism prowess. Yet these campaigns served a secondary purpose, too. They were low-key shows of force obliquely directed at bigger foes. British officials are wary of discussing operations against Russia or China. But ""the fact you don't see that we use it doesn't mean we don't,"" noted Mark Sedwill in October, freshly retired as national security adviser.
Therein lies some of the appeal. ""Policymakers love offensive cyber, for the same reason that they love special forces and intelligence operations,"" says a former senior British official, who worked closely with two prime ministers. ""They are largely covert, can be deployed flexibly and don't have to be disclosed to or debated in Parliament or the press.""
Some cyber-operations are dramatic attacks that literally destroy physical equipment. Most are more prosaic. The ncf will probably spend more time tackling online child sexual exploitation and fraud than threatening Russia's power grid. That a mixture of soldiers and civilians should handle everything from criminality to allout war is unusual. The ncf ""has no equivalent anywhere else in the world"", notes Marcus Willett, gchq's former deputy head, approvingly.
Yet if the ncf has laid its foundation stones, its intellectual scaffolding remains a work in progress. Ciaran Martin, who retired as head of gchq's defensive arm in August, warns that ""in all my operational experience, I saw absolutely nothing to suggest that the existence of Western cyber capabilities, or our willingness to use them, deters attackers."" A former British spy chief agrees. ""The reality is that nonmilitary uses of offensive cyber are massively over-played."" Outside wartime, he says, such operations ""will always be niche and ephemeral, though occasionally useful for sending messages"".
Mr Martin expresses another concern: that Western cyber-armouries might be raided, with baleful consequences for civilian digital infrastructure. ""No one is likely going to be able to steal a nuclear weapon. No one will accidentally lose or leak a ballistic missile...None of these statements hold true for cyber capabilities.""
gchq says that its operations are ""responsible, targeted and proportionate, unlike those of some of our adversaries"". The ncf will be scrutinised by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Even so, Mr Martin urges caution. ""We weaponise the internet at our peril,"" he maintains. ""In the cyber domain, the best form of defence is defence."" *"

The collapse of two retailers bodes ill for Britain's most prevalent occupation
Unable to compete with the convenience of shopping online, the high street has been crumbling for years; and the covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend. Arcadia, a retailing conglomerate, announced that it would enter administration on November 30th. The next day Debenhams, a 207-year-old department store chain, which has been in administration since April, said it would start winding down its business. Some 25,000 jobs are at risk across the two companies. The real estate they occupy, some 15.5m square feet according to the Local Data Company, a research firm, risks falling fallow.
The retailing business employs 3m people and occupies vast swathes of property. The proportion of shopping done online has increased from 20% before the pandemic to 27% today, according to data compiled by the Royal Society for Arts. Whereas jobs in hospitality and leisure are likely to return as the virus subsides, the changes in retail are ""a longer-term adjustment and the jobs won't bounce back"", reckons Hannah Slaughter of the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank.
The full effects of the covid shock to retail are likely to arrive next summer. By then the government's job-retention scheme, and its holiday on business rates, a commercial-property tax paid to local authorities, will have run out. The truth will be writ in retailers' quarterly filings, which lag by three months. It will almost certainly mean a sharp rise in the number of unemployed retail workers, and the number of unoccupied commercial premises in town centres. Ms Slaughter notes that the long decline of retail over the past decade has been slow enough to manage itself from a policy perspective. The pandemic's acceleration may require government help to minimise the pain.
Retail workers who lose their jobs as a result of covid-19-the British Retailers Consortium reckons they will number a quarter of a million by the summer-are more likely to find work in other sectors, such as care, which is short of labour. Ms Slaughter suggests that government workcoaches might focus more on this reallocation than they usually do.
Empty shops may be a harder problem to solve. A loosening of planning laws may encourage the repurposing of vacated shops for a trendier and more diverse range of businesses and allow a mix of retail and residential to revive town centres. But the results of an older retail bankruptcy suggest caution. A quarter of the property left empty by British Home Stores, which went bust in 2016, is still empty today. In the premises that have new tenants, the majority are other retailers paying knockdown rents, according to Ronald Nyakairu of the Local Data Company. In a few places, such as London, have they found new uses: one in Putney has become a swanky block of flats, while one on Oxford Street is an indoor golf course.
But for depressed town centres, left behind in myriad other ways, the hipsterfication of the cavernous corpses of shopping spaces looks an empty promise. Bringing vibrancy to those areas will be far more complicated. And for the retail workers there who have lost their jobs? A position at an Amazon logistics warehouse beckons. Those are being built apace. *"

The first months of Boris Johnson's tenure as mayor of London, back in 2008, were, by common consent, a mess. Projects fizzled. Senior aides flounced. Chaos reigned. Then ""bungling Boris"", as the newspapers dubbed him, appointed a talented chief of staff. The self-effacing but effective Simon Milton brought order to chaos and turned dither into decisiveness. Mr Johnson became Britain's most popular Tory and was re-elected by a landslide.
His first year in Downing Street recalls those early days in the mayor's office. A slow response to the outbreak of covid-19 may have doubled the death rate; clumsy handling of the purchase of personal protective equipment left front-line workers vulnerable and led to dodgy deals to get hold of the stuff; faffing about exams generated confusion and anxiety. The angry departure of Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's former chief adviser, and his Brexiteer acolytes left Downing Street shell-shocked. Party discipline has collapsed. On December 1st 53 Tory mps voted against the government's tiered-lockdown system and 16 abstained, the biggest revolt since Mr Johnson became prime minister.
But his premiership may be about to undergo a transformation, for he may have found himself a new Simon Milton. Dan Rosenfield is due to take over as his chief of staff on January 1st. In a political world in which almost nobody agrees on anything, almost everybody has a good word for Mr Rosenfield.
The new chief of staff's most obvious qualification is that he is the antithesis of Mr Cummings. Mr Rosenfield is a peacemaker where Mr Cummings is a warmonger, an organiser where Mr Cummings is an ideas man, a smooth operator where Mr Cummings is spiky. Mr Cummings wanted to blow up the British establishment. Mr Rosenfield personifies it.
He spent more than ten years in the Treasury, the engine room of the British government, eventually serving as principal private secretary to both Labour's Alistair Darling and the Conservatives' George Osborne. He also has extensive experience in business. He left the Treasury to work as an investment banker and five years later moved to Hakluyt, a posh corporate-advisory firm with close links to the secret service, whose chairman, Paul Deighton, is also chairman of The Economist Group. Some Tories worry that, unlike two of his recent predecessors, Gavin Barwell and Nick Timothy, he is a neophyte when it comes to the ruling party's internal machinations. But for a man with sensitive political antennae, which Mr Rosenfield clearly has, a certain distance from the warring Conservative tribes may be an advantage.
Mr Rosenfield has two qualities that his boss conspicuously lacks. As his success at Hakluyt suggests, he is a master of getting things done rather than generating ideas or spinning stories: the company expects its people to complete projects, not just to act as rainmakers. He is also steeped in economics and business. Mr Johnson's indifference to economics puts him at a disadvantage in arguments with the Treasury, let alone in policymaking. His poor relations with business could also become a problem if Sir Keir Starmer succeeds in mending fences between Labour and the private sector. Mr Rosenfield is business-friendly to a fault.
The appointment of a new chief of staff is the centrepiece of a wide-ranging shake-up of Emperor Boris's Praetorian Guard. The congenitally narcissistic media has fixated on the appointment of Allegra Stratton, one of its own, as head of press relations, but more interesting changes have taken place behind the scenes. Mr Johnson has appointed Neil O'Brien to run the Policy Review Board, the party's internal think-tank. A northern mp, Brexiteer and former Treasury adviser, Mr O'Brien is a fount of ideas on what ""levelling up"" means in practice. Mr Johnson is also working hard to repair the damage Mr Cummings did to his relations with the parliamentary party. There are even rumours of a plan to move the Whips' Office from Parliament back to Downing Street (Number 12, where it used to be, not Number 10). Most important of all, a big cabinet reshuffle is in the works.
Mr Rosenfield's first day in the job could be difficult if, as looks quite possible, Britain leaves the European Union without a deal. Even if there is one, he will be wading into quicksand. The prime minister's biggest problems are political rather than purely organisational. Brexit was always a bundle of contradictions held together by a shared hostility to the eu and a vague optimism about freedom. Mr Johnson's taste for waffle and fudge made him the perfect leader of the movement as long as it was about protest. With the end of the transition period he will have to focus on what he likes least: making difficult decisions and tough trade-offs.
Party management is also becoming harder, as the dysmorphic Tory party completes its transition from the natural party of government into a British version of the Taliban, dominated by a bunch of right-wing revolutionaries and in a permanent state of fury and factitiousness. It was always going to be tricky for a prime minister who made his career by rebelling against the leadership to impose party discipline. The party's disintegration into factions that reflect warring ideological and regional priorities has made it almost impossible: the One Nation group of liberal Tories, the 109 Group of new mps (oddly named, since there are 66 of them), the Northern Research Group, the Covid Recovery Group and the grandmother of them all, the European Research Group of Eurosceptics. Many of the last lot are battle-hardened, addicted to revolt and already convinced that the Downing Street reset is an establishment plot to neuter Brexit and return to business as usual.
For all that, better organisation can improve things. Much of the mess that the government has made of the pandemic has been the result of poor management. And despite that, and despite the infighting, it is still level-pegging with Labour in the opinion polls. Imagine how things might look with a new team in Downing Street, a ruthless reshuffle and mass vaccinations under way. Don't bet against another Miltonic resurrection. *"

VILNIUS
But it is still a time of monsters
Svetlana tikhanovskaya, a former teacher and a mother of two, did not choose to make history. But history has chosen her for a starring role. Despite her lack of political experience, she has come to personify the struggle to transform Belarus from docile former Soviet republic to free and truly independent nation. The leaders of rich democracies greet her as president-elect. Her own people derive comfort from her simple, calm words. Alexander Lukashenko, the gun-toting dictator who has ruled Belarus for the past 26 years, fears her enough to have forced her out of the country after she (probably) won a presidential election in August.
That was not meant to happen. All the main challengers, including Ms Tikhanovskaya's husband, were in jail. Opinion polls were banned. The media and the security apparatus were firmly under the strongman's control. Mr Lukashenko let a tonguetied housewife with no taste for power register her candidacy, some say, just to demonstrate the futility of opposition.
But on August 9th, fed up with being treated like cattle, the people of Belarus voted for Ms Tikhanovskaya, whose only pledge was to release political prisoners and hold free and fair elections within six months. When Mr Lukashenko declared himself the winner, with 80% of the votes, they thronged into the streets. The dictator sent his goons to beat them up, just as he had done in 2006 and in 2010.
But this time the violence was so extreme that instead of clearing the streets of protesters, it detonated a national uprising. Petrified, Mr Lukashenko had Ms Tikhanovskaya taken hostage and coerced into reading a statement denouncing the protests before being driven out of the country. But this tactic, too, has failed.
""When I got here, I was in despair, ready to give up,"" she tells The Economist in an interview in Vilnius, the capital of neighbouring Lithuania. ""I felt like a traitor and when I saw people emerge from detention half-alive, I felt guilt."" But instead of blame, she got support and compassion from the Belarusians. ""When people came out again the next day, after all that happened, I knew I could not stop,"" she says, struggling to hold back tears. And so, after three days of despair, she recorded a new appeal to the nation and called for the protests to go on.
Growing up in Mr Lukashenko's tightly controlled Belarus, Ms Tikhanovskaya had little interest in politics or in the country's history, its symbols or even its language. ""I spoke Belarusian in the summer when I went to see my grandparents in the country,"" she says: Russian the rest of the time. She never bothered with elections, and was unaware of a national revivalist movement that simmered under the surface among the country's artistic and intellectual elite. She could not have imagined that members of that circle, including Franak Viacorka, a journalist and one of the chief ideologists of the movement, would become her righthand advisers.
Unlike them, she was not exercised by the red-and-white flag of the short-lived 1918 Belarusian republic, briefly readopted as the national banner of post-Soviet Belarus only to be crumpled by Mr Lukashenko three years later. She lived instead under a modified green-and-red flag taken from Soviet-era Belarus that Mr Lukashenko brought in. The Soviet Union's victory in the second world war is the main national holiday. ""To me Belarus was a geographic territory inside the former Soviet Union,"" she says.
For years Mr Lukashenko, almost unique among post-Soviet leaders, cultivated a Soviet rather than a national Belarusian identity, in the hope that he might claim the throne of a reconstituted Russian-Belarusian empire. That hope was crushed by the emergence of Vladimir Putin as Russia's all-powerful leader after 1999. And Mr Putin's annexation of Crimea in 2014 made Mr Lukashenko nervous; he came instead to reimagine himself as the guardian of the country's sovereignty against Russia.
But by doing so, he stepped into an unfamiliar space, already occupied by nationalists armed with social media, modern technology, history and ideas. Between them they have built uncontrollable Telegram social media channels that link 3m people, half the adult population of Belarus. Mr Lukashenko provided plenty of fuel for their movement. His ridiculous denials of the coronavirus pandemic mobilised civil society; his blatant election-rigging turned a routine election into a struggle for national emancipation. Ms Tikhanovskaya, an ordinary Belarusian woman, became the face of a mass movement.
The protesters lacked a radical edge. A perfect opportunity arose in late August, when thousands of people besieged a detention centre where people were being tortured, raped and beaten so that their screaming could be heard outside. But at the critical moment, out of nowhere, came a few hundred mysterious ""volunteers"" who formed a human chain and pleaded with their ""fellow"" protesters not to storm the jail. So the storming of the Belarusian Bastille never happened.
Since then, Mr Lukashenko has managed to regain some control and squeeze the protesters from the city centre. They have retreated into courtyards and residential areas, where protests are harder to monitor and control. Mr Lukashenko hopes to wear the protesters out. But a recent poll conducted by Warsaw-based sociologists shows that 84% of those protesting are prepared to go on until Mr Lukashenko is gone. The Kremlin, which has so far backed Mr Lukashenko politically and economically, is aware of this and is nudging him to start preparing for a transition, under a new constitution.
Mr Lukashenko may cling to power a little longer. But the red-and-white flag will not be put away. ""I am proud to be Belarusian. We are an independent country in the middle of Europe. Our readiness to stand for each other is what makes us a nation,"" says Ms Tikhanovskaya. Her story is surely not over. *"

IZMIR
Turkey recovers from one deadly earthquake, and braces for more
Near one of Izmir's main thoroughfares, bulldozers and excavators power through a vast heap of rubble and steel wire, the ghastly remains of an apartment block levelled by an earthquake that struck Turkey's third-biggest city in late October. Movers salvage furniture and kitchen supplies from buildings awaiting demolition or on the verge of collapse, their facades covered with deep cracks. A few hundred metres away, outside a shelter for those made homeless by the disaster, Meryem, a divorced teacher, and her two children are packing their belongings onto a pickup truck. Her house survived, says Meryem, but suffered so much damage that she refuses to go back. ""I would not wish this on anyone,"" she says.
At least 116 people died in the magnitude 7.0 quake, including a woman who drowned in a minor tsunami set off by the tremors. Rescue teams poured in from all over the country. Thousands of people volunteered to give blood. Local businesses distributed food to the survivors. Nearly three days into the search effort, exhausted workers pulled a three-year-old girl from the rubble of her home. A day later, they rescued another toddler.
Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Turkey has seen four deadly earthquakes this year alone and 18 tremors measured at 7.0 or above in the past 120 years. Almost 60m people, or 70% of the population, live in seismic zones. Yet disaster response is no longer a serious problem in Turkey. Preparedness is. Out of a total of about 10m buildings, 20-25% do not meet current standards for earthquake protection, says Mustafa Erdik, head of the Turkish Earthquake Foundation. Others put the figure even higher.
The risk is especially acute in Istanbul, home to over 15m people. Nearly 70% of the city's housing stock dates from before 2000. Two decades ago, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake killed at least 17,000 people. Scientists agree that another big one is a matter of time. Some put the probability at up to 40% over the next 30 years. According to a recent study by the local planning agency, another earthquake of similar magnitude would destroy 48,000 buildings, damage 194,000 and cause 120bn lira ($15bn) in damages. Since Istanbul accounts for a third of Turkey's gdp, the longterm economic damage could be severe.
Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and his government have taken steps to lessen the impact of future quakes. Over 500,000 vulnerable buildings have been demolished and replaced since the launch of an ""urban renewal"" programme in 2012. Under a scheme partly financed by the World Bank, the government has earthquake-proofed more than 1,200 schools and hospitals in Istanbul. A slew of recent infrastructure projects, including a new bridge over the Bosporus and an undersea tunnel, have been designed to withstand big quakes. Over 56% of Turkish homeowners have taken out earthquake insurance, one of the highest rates in the world, and up from 26% a decade ago.
But Turkey seems to have taken a step back for every step forward. Critics say urban renewal has enriched companies close to the government, overlooked environmental concerns and triggered a wave of evictions. ""This was a very good programme,"" says Naci Gorur, a geologist at Istanbul Technical University. ""But they handed it to the developers, who prioritised those neighbourhoods where they could make the most profit."" The construction frenzy that propelled Turkey's economy under Mr Erdogan has swallowed up open spaces and parks. Of the 470 assembly areas designated in Istanbul after the 1999 quake, only 77 remain, according to the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Ahead of an election two years ago, the government announced an amnesty on unlicensed construction. The scheme benefitted the owners of over 7m properties across Turkey. One of these was an apartment building in Istanbul that collapsed on its own early last year, killing 21 people. Three of its eight floors had been illegally built. *"

AMSTERDAM
Thierry Baudet, a classical-music-loving populist, blows up the party he built
A photo of Thierry Baudet from a newspaper profile in 2014 shows him sprawled on his grand piano, gazing fetchingly to camera. The Chopin-playing Dutch intellectual, then 31, had written a book denouncing the eu. Two years later he co-founded a party, Forum For Democracy (fvd), which won the largest vote-share in provincial elections in 2019. In a speech that night Mr Baudet described it as a world-historical turning point, invoking Hegel's ""owl of Minerva"", a symbol of wisdom that ""spreads its wings only [at] dusk"".
This month the fvd blew itself up in a series of scandals, and music again played a role. At a dinner on November 20th a newly recruited politician wanted to play 1980s disco. Mr Baudet insisted on classical. Soon, says an fvd senator who later quit the party, Mr Baudet was ranting that covid-19 was a plot by George Soros. He answered worries about antiSemitism in the party by saying that ""almost everyone I know is anti-Semitic."" (He later repudiated these statements, but did not explain what he had meant.)
The next day a newspaper published chats full of racist and anti-Semitic vitriol among fvd's youth wing, run by Mr Baudet's ally, Freek Jansen. Rather than fire Mr Jansen, Mr Baudet quit as parliamentary leader. But he stayed on as an mp, and said he would return as leader if members asked. The fvd's provincial and city office-holders began deserting the party. So did its other mp and most of its senators, including Paul Cliteur, a legal philosopher whose department at the University of Leiden served as fvd's intellectual breeding ground.
As recently as March polls gave fvd about 11% of the vote. But as Mr Baudet flirted with covid-19 conspiracy nutjobbery, its support slid to around 3%. Many who once thought Mr Baudet merely provocative now see him as a dangerous crank. Henk Otten, a senator and one of the party's co-founders, was pushed out last year after warning that Mr Baudet was being radicalised. He says he has turned into a ""fascist psychopath"".
fvd's board says the party's 40,000odd members will vote on whether or not Mr Baudet should return. Mr Otten says the statutes do not provide for that. But Chris Aalberts, author of a book about the party, says its rules do not matter much: ""It is a one-man system."" Mr Baudet may stay on as head of a rump fvd and win a few seats at the general election in March. Geert Wilders, the head of the Netherlands' other far-right populist party, is overjoyed. As fvd has withered, its voters have come over to him."

PARIS
A bill that could shield cops from scrutiny is being revised
At 6.42PM on November 21st, three policemen forced their way into a recording studio in a smart area of Paris and savagely beat up Michel Zecler, a black record producer. Pursued for not wearing a face mask, Mr Zecler initially spent 48 hours in detention for violence against the police, and says that during the beating he was called a ""sale negre (dirty negro)"". On November 30th, four days after a surveillance video of his beating was posted on social media, contradicting the officers' account, preliminary charges were brought against the three, for intentional violence and the falsification of police records. All have been suspended.
The episode not only shocked France; President Emmanuel Macron said on social media that it ""put us to shame"". It has also prompted an extraordinary u-turn by the government. For the beating took place as a controversial ""general security"" bill designed to reinforce police powers was going through parliament. Article 24 of the draft law, which was passed by the lower house on November 24th and will next go to the Senate, would forbid the posting or broadcasting of any image that identifies an individual officer during a police operation ""with the manifest aim of physically or psychologically causing them harm"". Had the bill already been on the statute books, it might have made posting the video that exposed Mr Zecler's ordeal illegal.
The point of Article 24, according to Gerald Darmanin, the hard-line interior minister who drafted it (presumably with Mr Macron's initial approval), is to protect the police from attempts to identify and target individuals, whether physically or on social media. French policemen regularly get online threats. In 2016 a police officer and a police employee were stabbed to death in front of their three-year-old son in Magnanville, a town north-west of Paris. Investigators found a list of names of police officers, among other figures, on the perpetrator's computer.
The French media and others worried about press freedom, however, cried foul. An editorial in Le Monde, a newspaper, called Article 24 ""pernicious"". Ten deputies from Mr Macron's party, La République en Marche (lrem), voted against the bill, and 30 more abstained. On November 28th tens of thousands of people took to the streets of cities across France to protest. Even Macronistes are concerned about the president's drift to the right on security matters.
At first, the government tried to defend Article 24. Faced with a groundswell of hostile opinion, however, Mr Macron on November 30th told parliamentarians at a crisis meeting at the Elysée Palace to rewrite the article completely. ""It's not a very glorious way of getting out of the situation,"" says Roland Lescure, an lrem deputy. ""But at least it's clear and quick, and a way of saying 'sorry, we got it wrong, let's go back to the drawing board.'""
Mr Macron's и-turn over Article 24 may now defuse the tension over press freedom. But the events that helped to prompt the reversal, and in particular Mr Zecler's beating, will require a longer-term policy response. France does not collect data on its citizens' ethnicity, so it is difficult to know the scale of racial discrimination. But an official study in 2016 found that a young man ""perceived as black or Arab"" is far more likely to be stopped for an identity-card check than anyone else. Mr Darmanin, who now finds himself under internal pressure, has promised to come up with a proper review of training and diversity, as well as police oversight and discipline. It may have taken a particularly nasty case, but the problem of racism among the French police is at least beginning to be acknowledged. *"

It took a pandemic to silence Gerhard Schmiderer. For the past quarter-century, the now 70-year-old ""DJ Gerhard"" has blasted trashy hits for drunken aprės-skiers at MooserWirt, a bar in St Anton, an Austrian ski resort. This year, however, the speakers will be silent rather than blaring out yet another rendition of ""The Final Countdown"", a raucous anthem sung by big-haired Swedes. The usual revellers dancing on tables in ski boots will be absent. The 500-metre run back to the resort will no longer be strewn with those who have quaffed too much and fallen over in the snow.
This sad story is repeated across the rest of Europe's nearly 4,000 ski resorts. Chairlifts have largely ground to a halt because of the pandemic. Bad memories linger from spring, when an outbreak in Ischgl, another Austrian resort, led to at least 6,000 cases in more than 40 different countries. Covid-19 loves ski resorts. People drive or fly in from all over Europe to crowded mountaintop villages. Queues for lifts are packed. Changing rooms are explosions of sweat as panting bankers heave themselves into salopettes. Bars are bacchanalian. Yodelling, an efficient way to spread the virus, is not unheard of. As the rich partied in the Alps in March, hospitals overflowed in Lombardy, a few hundred miles away. No one wants to see that again.
Agreeing to write off the first few weeks of the European ski season until the current wave of the pandemic has passed ought to be uncontroversial. Yet it has triggered a row. France, Germany and Italy all agreed to keep resorts shut until January. Austria was affronted. ""We will not tell France when to reopen the Louvre,"" harrumphed one Austrian minister. Bavaria's premier warned that anyone who crossed the border for a few days on the slopes would face 10 days of quarantine on the way back. Austria eventually acquiesced, effectively banning skiing except for local day-trippers until next year. It was, however, a revealing fight.
Europeans ski a lot. In total, they spend roughly 200m days a year skiing-about the same as the rest of the world combined. Austria, France and America all rack up a similar number of days on the piste, despite their vastly different populations. Skiing is a quintessentially European invention. Its modern form started in Scandinavia, before it was seized on by 19th-century adventurers. It was commercialised across the Alps, after consumers found being pulled to the top of a mountain a more pleasant experience than schlepping up on foot. Each nation brings its own approach: proficient Austrians are notorious for taking it seriously; enthusiastic but terrible Dutch skiers much less so. It speaks to a certain ideal of Europe, in which it is possible to wake up in France and lunch in Italy. All European life is there at any resort-provided they can afford €i,000-plus for a few days of fun.
Skiing raises mountains of cash. During winter months it generates 4% of Austrian gdp, according to ing, a bank. For comparison, Germany's mighty car industry makes up 5% of the country's economy. This explains why Berlin's demands that Austria rope off the slopes for Christmas went down so badly. Imagine if the Austrian chancellor had asked his German counterpart if she would mind temporarily closing the car industry. (There is a climate crisis, after all, Angela.)
For a bloc that prides itself on dissolving borders, skiing is a knotty issue. Mountains are immovable natural frontiers where questions of sovereignty are heightened. Governments in the eu may have pooled sovereignty, but they jealously guard what competences they do have, even if it only involves ski lifts. If resorts in some countries lock down for health reasons, another government could scoop up any spare revenue. Normally, eu regulations are supposed to stop such races to the bottom. When it comes to skiing, the eu has no say. As far as officials in Brussels are concerned, that is a bullet dodged. In Europe's delicate ecosystem, mountain communities sit alongside farmers and fishermen as near-untouchable endangered species to be protected at all costs. Far better to let national politicians take the hit.
After all, there will be a political cost. French resorts can only watch as their Swiss peers-outside the eu and apparently free from any moral obligation not to shaft their neighbours-stay open only a few hundred metres down the valley. Nicolas Rubin, the mayor of Chatel, a resort on the French border, decked his town hall out in Swiss flags in protest.
Those who want to keep on skiing have a point. Sliding down a hill with planks attached to one's feet is no riskier, in terms of catching coronavirus, than a cycling trip. (Although bellowing ""We're headin' for Venus/ And still we stand tall"" into the face of a Belgian stranger in a bar at 1,300 metres is another matter.)
Not going downhill
Whether families can squeeze in a skiing holiday during a pandemic is a decadent debate-and a familiar one. A similar row erupted about whether to reopen the continent for tourism over the summer. If the priority had been to eliminate the virus, the answer would have been no. But Europeans could not bear the idea of being stuck at home in August, so they packed their bags and zipped across the continent. The consequences were predictable and predicted. Holidaymakers spread the virus.
Every polity has sacred issues that make rationality leap out of the window. In America, it is guns. In Britain, it is health care. In France, it is food. One such issue is a constant across every European country: politicians muck about with holidays at their peril. Whether consciously or not, a choice was made in the summer between health and holidays. Holidays won. This time, at least, a more difficult choice has been made. If resorts do fully reopen this season, the Austrian government has decreed that the throbbing aprės-ski parties will be banned. MooserWirt may have to wait until things are back to normal. When they are, expect to find a 71year-old behind the decks. *"

The economic recovery no longer looks indestructible. A difficult winter looms
In the summer and autumn America's economy roared back. After peaking at nearly 15% of the labour force, unemployment fell like a stone, while in the third quarter gdp bounced from its lockdowninduced slump. The recovery of the world's largest economy seemed oddly impervious to a second and then a third wave of coronavirus infections, even as economic activity in other parts of the world took a hit.
Yet there are growing concerns that the run of surprisingly good economic news is over, at least until a vaccine becomes widely available. In congressional testimony on December 1st Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the recovery was slowing, while the decision on the same day by a bipartisan group of senators to release a proposal for a stimulus package reflects the same fears. The jobs report for November, which was to be released shortly after The Economist went to press, will probably be a downbeat one by recent standards-and whatever it shows, it is old news, since the surveys for the report were taken some weeks ago. More up-to-date figures show that the recovery has lost steam. That is bad news for the millions who remain out of work, as well as the rapidly growing share of Americans who are living in poverty.
Official statistics tend to be produced with long lags. So during the pandemic economists have turned to ""high-frequency"" data, largely produced by the private sector and generated by consumers' and firms' transactions, to measure the economy in real time. Wall Street banks now routinely provide clients with updates on everything from weekly electricity consumption to daily hotel bookings. The high-frequency data do not map onto the official kind perfectly. But they are useful for finding turning-points. They pinpointed the start of the downturn in March long before the official statistics could.
America is at another turning-point. str, a data provider, finds that in the week ending November 21st hotels were running at 40% occupancy, down from 50% only weeks ago. The number of diners in restaurants has sharply declined in recent weeks, suggest data from OpenTable, a booking platform, with the fall even steeper in the states hardest hit by the virus. A recovery in air-passenger numbers appears to have ground to a halt as well.
Other real-time measures capture economic activity more broadly. The share of small firms which have temporarily closed is probably rising. Consumer spending in the week ending November 22nd was down by 5% compared with the one before, according to Cardify, a data provider. Using mobility data from Google, The Economist has constructed an economic-activity index measuring visits to workplaces, transport hubs and places of retail and recrea- tion. After rising steadily during the autumn, the index has fallen back-though America still looks better than Europe, where the economic-activity index has crashed as governments have imposed another round of lockdowns. jpMorgan Chase, a bank, produces an estimate of monthly American gdp growth from a range of real-time data. In a report published on December 2nd, it suggests that output stopped growing in November.
Three factors explain the slowdown. To some extent it was inevitable. Loosening lockdowns had allowed millions of people to return to work and start spending again. But there was no comparable loosening of coronavirus restrictions after that. So it was never realistic for America to repeat the 7.4% quarter-on-quarter gdp growth that it saw in July to September.
Fiscal policy is the second factor. Another reason the economy bounced back so quickly in the summer was the enormous generosity of the stimulus packages agreed by Congress in the spring, worth some $3trn (or 14% of gdp). Yet Congress has so far failed to agree to another one, even though the most bullish forecasters still reckon a package worth over $500bn is required to help the economy back to some semblance of normality. A programme set up by President Donald Trump to raise unemployment-insurance (ui) payments by $300 a week, which had boosted aggregate household incomes by 1.5%, wound down in October. States and local governments, facing a severe budget crunch, cut over 1m jobs in the first six months of the pandemic, more than they lost even during the financial crisis of 2007-09.
The third and most important reason for the slowdown is the virus itself. Until recently many Americans, especially in Republican-leaning areas, seemed oddly happy to go about their business as normal. In South Dakota in September and October, for instance, visitors to sites of retail and recreation were 1.5% higher than usual for that time of year, even as coronavirus infections surged. Analysis by The Economist, drawing on Google data and work by Mark Muro and colleagues at the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, found that in the summer and autumn people in pro-Trump areas were half as likely to avoid public places as people living in areas that had voted for Joe Biden (see chart 1).
But now even people in the most proRepublican areas appear to be getting skittish, too. In the week before Thanksgiving attendance at South Dakotan recreationand-retail was 8% lower than normal. The continued increase in coronavirus cases may partially explain this, but a rise in death rates may be more significant. Research by Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson, both of the University of Chicago, finds that local deaths from coronavirus have a big impact on a local economy, perhaps because they bring home the seriousness of the situation. Deaths lag behind cases, and the share of American counties with at least one death from coronavirus in the previous week is soaring (see chart 2). Surveys suggest that a growing share of people worry about catching the virus.
The economy will rise again once a vaccine becomes available. Roughly 40% of the country should be vaccinated by March, suggests a recent paper by Goldman Sachs, a bank, putting America behind only Britain in terms of the speed of the rollout. And the vaccine-induced boost could be bigger than many expect. So far the pandemic has left surprisingly few scars on America's economy. Business bankruptcies and the number of people in long-term unemployment remain lower than during the financial crisis of 2007-09.
Until then there will be further drags on the economy. Two further provisions related to ui, one which expanded eligibility to include the self-employed and gig workers, and one which provided extra weeks of benefits for recipients, are due to expire at the end of the year. A number of emergency lending programmes are also likely to end at that time. And the pandemic remains out of control. America, and especially its poorest folk, face a tough winter. *"

WASHINGTON, DC
Why a Democratic cash advantage in the billions did not matter
In the heady days before the elections on November 3rd, when Democrats dared to dream of unified control of Washington and a coming progressive remake of America, two especially optimistic indicators elicited particular giddiness. First, of course, were the horse-race polls showing Joe Biden ahead of President Donald Trump by nine or so percentage points. But there was also the money race, which Democrats were winning handily: Mr Biden's campaign raised $952m, or nearly 60% more than Mr Trump's campaign, described by reporters as a profligate operation limping cash-strapped into November.
The down-ballot races looked even more favourable. In an election that cost a remarkable $14bn-more than twice the price tag in 2016-Democrats were spending 80% more than Republicans, the most lopsided advantage ever according to analysis by the Centre for Responsive Politics (crp), a research outfit. Unfortunately for them, a few extra billion seemed not to go very far in 2020. Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives and the party faces an uphill battle to take the Senate, by the thinnest possible margin, when runoff elections are held in Georgia in January.
Whether campaign spending actually moves voters is an unsettled debate-one of special academic interest to American political scientists and of special pecuniary interest to America's political-consulting-industrial complex. The political consultants would probably point to the robust correlation between raising the most money and winning an election: even in 2020, 89% of House candidates who spent most went on to win; the same was true of 70% of Senate candidates (albeit a two-decade low, according to the crp).
Political scientists would counter that a correlation is just that-perhaps one driven spuriously by the fact that truly hopeless candidates generally have a difficult time raising money. Candidates who are guaranteed to win also attract a lot of campaign donations from those who want access to them. The more nuanced assessment is that campaign spending can move voters on the margins, going furthest in less prominent and less polarised races (like primaries) where more voters are uninformed and undecided.
Democrats will want a more thorough post-mortem than that, though, given not just their recent grief but also a cruel irony of history. As the Supreme Court issued ruling after ruling deregulating campaign financing, most prominently in its Citizens United decision ten years ago, Democrats fretted that free-flowing dollars from rich Republican donors would place them at a permanent disadvantage, consigning them to the minority for the foreseeable future. But when they managed to secure a serious cash advantage, through considerable investments in online fundraising and freespending by billionaires of their own like Michael Bloomberg, they found it was not as decisive as they had hoped.
One partial explanation for the misfire is that better online fundraising enables greater hauls that are distributed inefficiently. Polls consistently showed that Amy McGrath had little chance of unseating Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, and yet she managed to raise $88m because there were thousands of Americans not in Kentucky willing to set their dollars on fire for the warm feeling of spiting Mr McConnell (and probably ignoring their local state legislative elections where Democrats were shut out). The top three employers for people donating to Ms McGrath were the University of California, Alphabet (based in Silicon Valley) and Microsoft (based in Seattle). West-coast cash helped buy a lot of television adverts for Ms McGrath ($18.6mworth), with little chance of wooing Republican voters in the first place and diminishing marginal returns afterwards.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the prominent Democratic socialist representative, issued a two-pronged post-mortem of her own soon after the disappointing election: moderate Democrats had failed to win because they had ignored online advertising on platforms like Facebook, and had neglected the years-long organising it takes to turn out voters. The first part of her theory is suspect, but the second may be correct.
This is aptly demonstrated by what happened in Maine, where Democrats hoped that Sara Gideon would topple Susan Collins, the longtime Republican senator. Ms Gideon certainly did not neglect internet advertising-spending nearly three times as much as her opponent on Google advertising and four times as much on Facebook ads. But Mainers bristled at the out-of-state canvassers imported by Ms Gideon for her campaign. ""Canvassing, phone-banking and people sending postcards is all a BandAid for a lack of social ties in the community,"" says Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts who has written a withering denunciation of political hobbyism in America. Democrats opt for quickly constructing and then dismantling expensive get-outthe-vote operations in each cycle, Mr Hersh adds, whereas Republicans are able to tap more durable networks built around churches and gun clubs.
Ultimately, money probably matters less than voters suspect. In a provocative (and highly-cited) paper entitled ""Why is there so little money in us politics?"", three political scientists pointed out that if campaign financing were really just an auction for federal spoils, then there ought to be much more of it given the colossal sums at stake. Instead, they argue persuasively that most campaign spending is driven by political dilettantes. During the Trump era, many incensed Democrats were willing to donate record sums to chasing lost causes. Campaigns (and their paid consultants) know that viral advertisements are a ticket to huge sums of internet cash. The donors, on the other hand, have little idea how effective their dollars will be. *"

WASHINGTON, DC
Congress edges closer to cracking down on anonymous shell companies
Out of the $4.5bn pilfered from imdb, a Malaysian state development fund, at least $1bn is alleged by American prosecutors to have been embezzled into the United States-spent in a Gatsby-esque frenzy on, among other things, a Manhattan penthouse, a Beverly Hills mansion and financing Hollywood films (including, naturally, ""The Wolf of Wall Street""). America's porous rules on anonymous shell companies make disguising the origins of money fairly straightforward. The Tax Justice Network, a good-government group, ranks America as the second-worst performer on its annual financial-secrecy index-ahead of famous tax havens like Switzerland and Luxembourg, and eclipsed only narrowly by the Cayman Islands. As recently as last year, American prosecutors were trying to wrest control of a 36-storey office building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, probably worth close to $1bn, on the grounds that it was secretly owned by the government of Iran, which is subject to some of the heaviest sanctions in the world.
Shell games such as these hide not only the penthouses of kleptocrats, but the financial networks for traffickers of arms, drugs and humans. Congress is on the cusp of making them harder to execute. The must-pass annual defence bill is slated to include legislation requiring companies to disclose to the Treasury Department's enforcement division their beneficial owners (those who actually enjoy the proceeds rather than those who sign the paperwork). ""The biggest vulnerability in our anti-money-laundering regime is the incorporation of anonymous shell companies,"" says Clark Gascoigne, a senior policy adviser at the fact Coalition, another anti-corruption outfit that has spent years pushing for the pending legislation. At present, notes Mr Gascoigne, there are more onerous disclosure requirements for obtaining a library card in all 50 states than for starting a new limited-liability company.
America's law-enforcement agencies are keen to get such data. ""The strategic use of these entities makes investigations exponentially more difficult and laborious,"" a senior fbi official testified to Congress last year. In fact, there is impressively little organised opposition to the new rules, which have strong bipartisan support. The Bank Policy Institute, a lobbying group, is a firm supporter (banks not only spend a non-trivial share of operating expenses on anti- money laundering compliance, but would also rather avoid news stories about terrorism financing). So, too, is the us Chamber of Commerce, which until June had opposed such measures. The National Federation of Independent Business, a smallbusiness lobby, is putting up a last stand of resistance, fretting that the new disclosure requirements would impose onerous paperwork requirements of 2.5 hours a year.
If it passes, the legislation would be the culmination of a long campaign. Banks were fairly quick to support the change. Realtors (estate agents to Brits) took longer to come round, as did the secretaries of state in places that make lots of money from incorporation fees. (Delaware earns almost as much from charging businesses as it does from its personal income tax.)
The bill would bring America's rules closer to Europe's. Britain has required disclosure of beneficial owners since 2016 (its register, unlike the one proposed by Congress, is public). The European Union required its member states to set up comparable schemes by January of this year. America has used the global heft of the dollar to go after international flows of illicit cash, while being permissive towards the ideal vehicles for money-laundering. That means ""the United States is increasingly helping to facilitate the very narcotics traffickers, human smugglers, terrorist networks and kleptocrats that weaken us national security,"" according to Jodi Vittori of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That looks likely to change. *"

CHICAGO
Millions of Americans still get their drinking water from lead pipes
Over a century has passed since the dangers of consuming lead became widely known. Ingesting even small quantities damages young brains and may raise the risk of heart problems. Yet residents of Chicago-and many other cities-still mostly swig from taps fed by lead pipes. About 400,000 lead service lines connect to the mains in the Windy City, linking about four in five of all houses there. One study of nearly 3,000 homes, two years ago, found two-thirds had elevated levels of lead in their water.
In Chicago some residents are told to flush their taps before drinking, to fit filters or avoid boiled water (doing so can concentrate higher levels of lead). Older houses in poorer districts may be worst affected. Since this problem has been identified for so long, why does it persist?
The city's water woes can be blamed in part on the historic clout of industrial lobbyists and a union of plumbers. In the last century, even as other cities stopped installing the pipes or started removing them, they nudged Chicago's political bosses to set rules making lead pipes compulsory. That lasted until a federal ban on new lead pipes in 1986. More than three decades on, Lori Lightfoot recently became the first mayor to set out a plan to fix things. The catch? It will cost $8.5bn, which the city government does not have. At the current pace of replacing fewer than 800 pipes a year, notes an alderman, residents won't all get lead-free water until the mid-26th century.
Mayors are more alert to the problem these days, especially since the water crisis in 2014 in Flint, Michigan exposed residents to high levels of lead leaching from their pipes. Flint is spending $100m upgrading its system. Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defence Council, who has campaigned on the issue for 30 years, says thousands of water systems across the country, serving tens of millions of people, still face ""serious problems"". The new attention to the problem encourages him.
A clutch of newish studies on the effects of lead exposure has helped. The hypothesis that lead damage to developing brains causes violence later in life is one of the great mysteries of social science-widely believed by those who plot the decline in violence against the decline in lead exposure and note how the two track each other; widely mistrusted by researchers who mutter about correlation and causation. Newer studies are more nuanced. One, by James Feigenbaum of Boston University and Christopher Muller of Berkeley, tried to control for other factors by comparing cities where the pH of the water supply was below seven, making it acidic, and causing lead to leach into water. The authors found acidic water tallied with more crime.
Some cities flush chemicals-orthophosphates-into pipes, to coat them to stop lead getting into the water. Milwaukee spends $400,000 a year to do so. That helps, but disturbances-such as when mains pipes are replaced but service lines to homes are not-can shake out particulates that remain in water. Karen Dettmer, superintendent of water works in Milwaukee, says events in Flint spurred her city to stop all repairs of lead lines. They also found, in 2017, ten schools fed by lead lines that were promptly replaced. Nurseries run from private homes remain exposed.
Milwaukee is trying to replace 1,100 lead lines each year-hoping to emulate cities such as Lansing, Madison and Green Bay which have recently replaced all their pipes. Pittsburgh, Newark and other cities also plan to do so. But the cost of replacing one pipe averages $11,000 in Milwaukee (it was lower elsewhere). And with service lines mostly on private land, the job involves negotiations and cost-sharing with owners. Doing it all ""will take about 70 years, that's not fast"", she says. Much housing stock is decades old and pipes inside homes may also be a source of lead.
With federal help, states and cities might move faster. One concern is regulation. The epa last updated its Lead and Copper Rule, setting out how fast lead pipes should be replaced, in 1991. It requires 7% of them in a given site to be swapped out yearly, though this has evidently not been enforced. An amendment the epa sent to the White House in July, which is still awaiting Donald Trump's signature, would relax that to 3% a year. (It would also tighten rules to speed replacement in schools.) Mr Olson calls the proposed change ""appalling"".
Cities want to make changes, but swapping out 10m service lines could cost $50bn, says Mr Olson (it is cheaper to do it in bulk). Twice this summer the Democratrun House of Representatives passed bills to start paying for it-first a $22.5bn authorisation, then an appropriations bill that set aside $1bn for this fiscal year. Proposed infrastructure bills also include sums for removing lead pipes. But in the Senate such plans have, so far, led nowhere.
Joe Biden's administration could nudge things on. The epa may set higher standards again and might order overdue public hearings on the topic, perhaps in badly afflicted cities like Flint. A bill co-sponsored by a Republican congressman from New Jersey, Chris Smith, would require all lead pipes to be replaced within a decade. His timetable may look too ambitious, but waiting for 500 more years to fix the problem isn't much of a plan, either."

WASHINGTON, DC
The intelligence agencies prepare for life after Trump
""The whole job of the intelligence T community (ic),"" explains Angus King, a senator from Maine whom Joe Biden considered naming Director of National Intelligence, ""is to seek the truth and tell the truth...[and to] provide absolutely unvarnished information without worrying what the leader wants to hear."" Most presidents value such independence. Donald Trump, less so. Over the past four years, he has compared intelligence agencies to Nazis, rubbished intelligence that displeased him and replaced professionals with unqualified sycophants. Doug Wise, a former deputy director of the Defence Intelligence Agency (dia), calls Mr Trump ""the global equivalent of an intelligence cancer"", who has damaged morale within agencies and emboldened America's adversaries.
The Biden administration will need to undo that damage, while also responding to emerging threats with a set of institutions often deemed too tied to outdated practices. Mr Biden's first steps are promising. He says he wants his national-security officials to ""tell me what I need to know, not what I want to know"". The last two of Mr Trump's four directors of national intelligence (DNi)-a role created in the wake of the September 11th attacks to promote better information-sharing among the 17 entities comprising America's intelligence apparatus-were a former ambassador and a three-term congressman, both of whom had negligible intelligence experience. They were there, according to Robert Cardillo, another former dia deputy director, ""as yes-men to ensure the ic didn't give [Mr Trump] any trouble.""
Mr Biden nominated Avril Haines as dni on November 24th. She was Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser and deputy cia director; John Brennan, her boss at cia, praises her ""humility, interpersonal skills and tremendous capability,"" as well as a ""work ethic...beyond peer"". She vowed to ""speak truth to power"" if confirmed. Her priority, according to Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, is ""restoring morale [and] reaffirming the notion that [analysts] speak the truth, even if it's not the administration's position.""
Undoing the damage abroad could prove trickier. On the one hand, intelligence sharing among the Five Eyes countries-America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand-proceeded more or less as usual during Mr Trump's tenure. The non-American intelligence agencies were occasionally more careful than usual in what they told the White House, to avoid triggering a presidential tantrum. Some worried that intelligence coming in the opposite direction may at times have been coloured by Mr Trump's political considerations. But intercepted communications are shared almost automatically. And Mr Cardillo says that most allies expressed ""relief"" when he told them: ""I get it, I know what's in the headlines and what you're seeing on Twitter, but we're still here, we still have this relationship.""
Trust funds
On the other hand, many worry that Mr Trump's denigration of his own spies has emboldened America's adversaries. His carelessness with classified informationearly in his presidency he offhandedly divulged some to Russia's foreign ministermay make it harder for America to attract would-be sources. The seasoned professionalism of the national-security team that Mr Biden has already assembled may calm some nerves, but restoring America's reputation for stability and care for its intelligence sources will take more than just words, and longer than just months.
Yet it is challenges unrelated to Mr Trump that are likely to prove trickier. After two decades of relentless focus on counterterrorism, the agencies are shifting resources and attention to ""great-power"" rivals, above all China. That requires different skills and capabilities than those wielded in the militarised war against jihadists. As Mr Warner notes, ""it's not just about who has the best rocket or submarine. Who's going to control the 5G network? What will be the ethical and legal criteria around Ai?...We kind of fell asleep at the wheel, and China flooded the zone with engineers in standard-setting areas.""
If all that were not enough, intelligence agencies are also facing something akin to the problems media companies ran into when news moved from the printed page to the internet, and readers no longer needed a paper to give them information such as sports results or the next day's weather forecast. ""Seventy years ago when intelligence agencies were being set up, collecting and analysing secrets was deemed the best way to understand the world,"" says Carmen Medina, a former deputy director of intelligence at the cia. Today, she says, ""a lot of the information that they stamp secret on, I can find anywhere else.""
Open-source intelligence, from commercial satellite imagery to social media, cannot substitute for the most hallowed sources-an agent in the Kremlin, say-but it offers insight without the encumbrances of classification. A new generation of officials and lawmakers have grown up in a world where they expect ""answers on demand"", says Zachery Tyson, a former intelligence official at the Pentagon. ""They are not going to use an ic where you have to go four floors down into the basement and log on to a secret computer with four different passwords to access a simple answer that you can approximate on Google."""

At the hoary age of 36, Jake Sullivan delivered this life lesson to graduating students of the University of Minnesota. ""Reject certitude. And don't be a jerk. Be a good guy."" He cannot be accused of ignoring his advice. The Democratic Wunderkind, who eight years later will become the youngest national security adviser since McGeorge Bundy in 1961, has a reputation for high-grade amiability that is even rarer in Washington, dc, than his big brain.
""He's the smartest guy in the room, but he's not cocky about it,"" says Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, who hired Mr Sullivan from the Minneapolis law firm where he had taken a brief break from elite institutions (Oxford, Yale Law, a clerkship at the Supreme Court). When he left her office to work on Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, he promised to return. He proceeded instead to make himself indispensable, in the State Department, White House and on the trail, to Mrs Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden in turn, including as the then vice-president's nsa. (""He did the trifecta,"" quips Ms Klobuchar, a trifle ruefully.)
Even Iran's mullahs were said to appreciate his lack of condescension, after he was charged by Mrs Clinton with a series of topsecret missions to the Gulf that opened a path to the Iran nuclear deal. More remarkably still, the mullahs of the Democratic left like him, too. This is on account of his intraparty peacemaking for Mr Biden; and also a soul-searching essay on the limits to neoliberalism that he penned in the wake of Mrs Clinton's loss to Donald Trump-for which, as her policy chief, he held himself partly to blame. The bipartisan foreign-policy world has welcomed his latest elevation with a gusto that goes beyond the usual post-Trump relief. ""He's a terrific choice,"" says Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to George W. Bush. ""He's a good person, very smart and very balanced.""
Such plaudits may prove hard to live up to. Especially as Mr Sullivan will be judged by harsher standards than his recent predecessors. Mr Trump's half-dozen national security advisers have been weighed by the media and Democratic opposition chiefly on their reported willingness to restrain the president's excesses. Thus the extraordinary turnabout in John Bolton's reputation on the left. Only Michael Flynn, who this week called for a military coup and the imposition of martial law to overturn the election, has been skewered for the failure of Mr Trump's foreign policy. Mr Sullivan can expect much stiffer criticism for much smaller setbacks. Barbed comments from Republican hawks such as Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, for whom any association with the Obama administration is unforgivable, suggest it has already begun.
On his core responsibilities-which will include restoring sanity to the inter-agency process and managing the rivalries it breeds-he will nonetheless start with big advantages. He knows Mr Biden's mind and has his confidence; the president-elect calls him a ""once in a generation intellect"". He has comradely relationships with Tony Blinken and other senior Biden nominees-and a habit of continually questioning his own assumptions which creates an impression of open debate. Often noted by those who have worked with him, this quality is also indicated by Mr Sullivan's self-critical recent writing, including that essay on economic policy, another in defence of American exceptionalism (""Despite its flaws, America possesses distinctive attributes..."") and a synthesising third essay, in Foreign Policy, on his ambition to bring foreign and domestic policy into alignment.
His willingness to adapt suggests the fear that Mr Biden's security agenda will be too backward-looking may be overblown. When Mr Biden said this week that he would not hurry to scrap the tariffs on China, and that he would try to expand as well as to reconstitute the Iran deal, he echoed positions that Mr Sullivan had previously laid out. The Biden administration will focus on rehabilitating the traditional means of statecraft-including diplomacy and basic competency-that the Trump administration disdains. But it will husband whatever useful leverage its predecessor has accrued, while pursuing some of the same hawkish objectives.
Mr Sullivan will find his grander scheme to integrate foreign and domestic policy tougher going. He makes a strong case-in his Foreign Policy piece and elsewhere-that globalisation has made this essential (as the pandemic underlined). Also that the cosy foreign-policy world needs better answers (as Mr Trump's success showed) for its populist critics. Mr Biden's promise of a ""foreign policy for the middle class"" speaks to the same concern. And Mr Sullivan can be expected to make at least modest efforts to address it. As nsa, he might be expected to play an unusually big role in trade and immigration discussions. By the same token, expect domestically orientated agencies-such as Health and Human Services-to play a bigger part in the inter-agency security debate.
Everything's Jake
Yoking together foreign and domestic objectives could also be offered as a political rationale for the more ambiguous relationship with China that Mr Biden wants. Where any engagement with the Party is currently considered a show of weakness, Mr Biden might argue that closer ties in areas such as public health and climate change are urgently required by the needs of ordinary Americans. But these would be marginal developments, far short of the transformation Mr Sullivan advocates, and for a familiar reason. Presidents pay such heed to foreign policy in part because their prospects of passing much on the home front are so limited. Linking foreign and domestic objectives will not fix the partisan dysfunction underlying that failure, as Mr Sullivan must realise.
His return to government is therefore liable to be much less ambitious than his writings might suggest. Meeting his admirers' expectations will be hard. But in picking Mr Sullivan, Mr Biden has given himself a better chance of bringing a period of disarray in American foreign policymaking to a close."

A movement founded by artists exemplifies a new sort of challenge to the regime
The front door of Damas 855, a ramshackle building in San Isidro, a poor neighbourhood of Havana, snapped like a wishbone when security agents charged through it on the evening of November 26th. The lock and chain tumbled to the ground. The agents, dressed in medical gowns, arrested 14 people (their pretext was that one of the residents had violated a covid-19 testing protocol). They had locked themselves in for eight days to protest against the arrest of Denis Solís, a young rapper who had been accused of disrespecting authority and sentenced to eight months in prison. A few of the Damas 855 denizens were on a hunger-and-thirst strike. Police cars took the detainees away. Facebook, YouTube and Instagram went down on most of the island for about an hour. Connections have been spotty since.
To defenders of Cuba's 62-year-old revolution, the adherents of Movimiento San Isidro (msi) are reprobates. On Twitter the country's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, called it an ""imperial show to destroy our identity and subjugate us again"". A photo of President Donald Trump accompanied the tweet. State media echoed the message.
Some Cubans take a kinder view of the movement, which includes artists, scholars, journalists, rappers, poets and scientists who advocate freer expression and more democracy than the communist regime allows. Its leaders are Luis Manuel Otero, a performance artist, and Maykel ""El Osorbo"" Castillo, a musician who sewed his lips shut in prison in August. They gather in a part of Old Havana where the mainly black residents live in rickety housing in the shadows of luxury hotels. When a balcony collapsed in January, killing three girls, Mr Otero wore a hard hat for nine days to honour them. He has been arrested more than 20 times over the past two years. His hunger strike landed him in hospital.
The movement began in September 2018 in response to Decree 349, which proposed to restrict cultural activity that is not authorised by the culture ministry. After a protest that month outside Cuba's legislature, the government suspended enforcement of the decree. That has not stopped it from silencing voices it doesn't like.
msi is not comparable to Belarus's mass movement to overthrow a dictatorship. Cuba has no such movement, though prodemocracy activists were among the 1,800 people who have been arbitrarily arrested in the first eight months of 2020, according to Human Rights Watch. msi has more in common with other recent home-grown protests that have wrung small concessions from the regime.
In August 2017 cuentapropistas (entrepreneurs) proposed reforms, such as the right to incorporate, to the labour ministry. Initially they were rebuffed. The government forced the cancellation of events meant to help budding entrepreneurs. When in 2018 it threatened to restrict each entrepreneur to one line of business, cuentapropistas, who run much of the economically vital tourist industry, said they would strike. The rules were eased.
A clash between the gamers who cobbled together SNet, a private intranet, and the communications ministry played out in a similar way, though the government yielded less. On an island with poor and ex-> ? pensive connectivity, the network was a way for gamers to play with one another, often games they had created. When the government restricted the use of such networks and threatened to confiscate the equipment in May 2019, SNet users were devastated. Several dozen gathered at the ministry to protest. Police cars quickly surrounded them. The government eventually decided that SNet and its hardware would be permitted, but under the supervision of the state-run youth computer clubs.
Like the cuentapropistas and the SNet gamers, msi began in response to a threat to its members' private pursuits. But it has more potential to grow. On the day after the Damas 855 raid nearly 300 people, many of them supporters of other movements, gathered outside the culture ministry, refusing to leave until the vice-minister, Fernando Rojas, agreed to meet them. Security forces and ""rapid-response groups"", trained to shout communist slogans at sceptics, flooded the area. Agents in plain clothes snapped photos and took videos.
Mr Rojas met with 30-odd activists for nearly five hours on November 27Ш-28Ш and promised more dialogue. But the government then launched a media campaign against msi. Police chased Mr Otero after his release from hospital.
Even so, the movement thinks it has made progress. The gathering outside the culture ministry is a sign of an emerging ""collective unconformity"", says Carlos Manuel Álvarez, one of the Damas 855 detainees and a co-founder of El Estornudo (""The Sneeze""), an independent online magazine. He sees that as a direct threat to the culture of submission demanded by the regime. Its agreement to meet participants in such a large protest ""was unprecedented"", says Camila Ramírez Lobón, a visual artist who joined the meeting with Mr Rojas. ists who both popular and acceptable to the regime, like Fernando Pérez, a film director, and Leoni Torres, a musician, have publicly backed msi . The
internet, unreliable though it is, is making such movements harder to control. More than 60% of Cubans have access to a connection. That has led to ""an explosion of civic activism"" among groups advocating such causes as feminism, gay rights and animal rights, says José Jasán Nieves, editor of El Toque (""The Touch""), an independent online publication. Some were at the culture-ministry protest. If they joined forces more often, they might challenge the government more effectively. Cuba's
ruling Communist Party, divided between hardliners who remember the revolution and younger officials who are slightly more liberal, is not about to yield. On December 1st the government released Silverio Portal Contreras, a prominent political prisoner (and supporter of Mr Trump, who has imposed sanctions on the Cuban regime). That is probably not a sign that the regime is growing tolerant of dissent. More likely, it was a way to allay anger about the San Isidro raid. Most
Cubans, who queue for hours for chicken or eggs, often to return home empty-handed, have little interest in the doings of agitators like those of msi. Their suffering has got worse since the pandemic shut down tourism. But a vaccine, and perhaps a softening of American sanctions by the incoming Biden administration, might eventually ease shortages. More Cubans might then ask why they have so little freedom. freedom.

CALGARY
The home of the oil sands looks for cleaner ways to make a living
A year ago, when Canada's government promised to end net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, Jason Kenney, Alberta's Conservative premier, erupted. The government's ideas were a ""fantasy plan for a mythical country"", he said. He scoffed at the ""California-style pieties"" of the Liberals who govern Canada. They imagine that people in poor countries like India ""are all going to be driving Teslas 15 years from now"", Mr Kenney said. In fact, ""they want to stop burning cow dung"".
The premier's fusillade was in defence of Alberta's oil industry, which has made the province's residents Canada's richest citizens. But it has lately suffered setbacks, most of which are more damaging than the Liberals' nefarious net-zero plans. Oil prices have yet to recover from a slump that began in 2014. Environmental activists have singled out Alberta's oil sands as an especially dirty source of crude. The thick bitumen they contain requires more energy, and money, to extract and refine than lighter oils do. Investment in the province's oil and gas sector plunged between 2014 and 2019 to C$26bn ($i9bn), around 6% of GDP (see chart). The covid-19 pandemic has made matters worse. The provincial unemployment rate of 10.7% is now among the highest in Canada.
These reversals are prompting Alberta, a conservative province often at odds with the federal government in Ottawa, to rethink its economic future. While Alberta's government expects demand for its oil to recover and resume its rise, it hopes to reduce its dependence on fossil-fuel investment for growth.
One sign of this is a series of recent initiatives to boost investment in cleaner forms of energy. In October Alberta's government proposed a law to provide a regulatory framework for investment in geothermal energy. The province has the right geology, and expertise in drilling. Energy from below the earth's surface can make use of abandoned oil and gas wells and the infrastructure that serves the industry.
On October 6th Mr Kenney announced that Alberta would seek to use its natural gas to produce and export hydrogen, a fuel that does not emit greenhouse gas. The carbon dioxide that comes from producing hydrogen would need to be captured and stored. He has joined the premiers of three other provinces to promote the development of small nuclear reactors. Alberta's government recently set up a council to devise ways of boosting extraction of minerals such as lithium and vanadium, which are used to make batteries.
A vociferous opponent of the federal government's policy of setting a price floor for carbon emissions, Mr Kenney has lately gone quiet on the issue. Alberta and several other provinces are still challenging in court the constitutionality of the broadbased carbon price, which is set to rise to C$50 a tonne by 2022. Alberta has a carbonpricing scheme for large emitters, which supports a fund that promotes emissions reductions. In September its government said it would immediately spend the C$750m in that fund, especially to develop carbon capture and storage.
The greener tinge to Alberta's policies is a big change from the fiery hue of Mr Kenney's successful campaign for the premiership in 2019. Wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat and touring in a blue pickup truck, he blasted the critics of Alberta's oil sands and vowed a return to the boom years. He accused the left-wing New Democratic Party (ndp), which then led the provincial government, of hobbling the oil industry with regulation. He excoriated Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, for failing to back the construction of pipelines to carry Alberta's oil to foreign markets. The message was popular. In the election Mr Kenney won 55% of the vote.
* His premiership has provided a humbling education. On a road show in New York last year investors told him bluntly that they really meant it when they talked of using environmental criteria to guide their decisions. Insurance companies are withdrawing coverage for pipeline construction projects that are opposed by environmentalists. Joe Biden, who will become the United States' president in January, has said he will cancel the permit for building the Keystone xl pipeline, in which Alberta's government has invested C$1.5bn.
Alberta's plans for a greener future are not fanciful. Its idled workers have skills that can be used to produce cleaner forms of energy. But there are obstacles. The province is far away from big energy markets, points out Andrew Leach, a specialist in energy economics at the University of Alberta. Heat and hydrogen are harder to transport than oil. In five or ten years, solar power may replace natural gas as a way of producing hydrogen, Mr Leach warns.
If Alberta's energy transformation is to improve Mr Kenney's political fortunes, it will have to happen fast. The federal government in Ottawa is splashing out to fight the economic effects of the pandemic: on November 30th it said it would spend an extra C$70bn-100bn, 3-4% of this year's gdp, over three years. But Mr Kenney's government is cutting the pay of public servants, including doctors. Reported cases of covid-19 are surging in the province. The ndp, which gives Mr Trudeau's minority government vital support in Parliament, has pulled ahead of Mr Kenney's Conservatives in provincial polls. The next election is due to be held in 2023. Alberta's pro-oil premier may not be the one to lead Alberta's green revolution. *"

IN DEATH, as in life, Diego Armando Maradona represented his country to the full. The funeral of Argentina's most famous footballer on November 26th was as passionate and chaotic as his country's affairs (see Obituary). In defiance of his own government's health rules, President Alberto Fernández ordered that Mr Maradona's coffin lie in state in the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace. Like the president, El Diego was a lifelong supporter of Peronism, Argentina's populist-nationalist movement. When the wake was curtailed, with thousands of fans queuing, pandemonium ensued.
Mr Fernández's craving for popularity by association is a sign of his weakness. The funerary disorder extends to the economy, too. A social democrat, the president took office a year ago, at the head of an uneasy Peronist coalition in which much power lies with his vicepresident, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (no relation), a leftist who ruled from 2007 to 2015. Within three months, the pandemic struck. Mr Fernández was quick to impose a lockdown, which brought a surge in his approval rating, but which delayed rather than prevented a severe outbreak of covid-19. Argentina is among the top ten countries for recorded deaths as a proportion of the population. Only now is the lockdown being eased. Mr Fernández's popularity is below its starting point.
In other matters, too, his government has little to show for its first year. Its main achievement was to renegotiate $65bn of debt with bondholders, though some economists question whether this was necessary. It has provided emergency aid to much of the population by printing money. The resulting inflation has been tempered, to 37%, by price controls. An already depressed economy will contract by around 12% this year, because of the pandemic. Now the government is negotiating, in slow motion, with the imf, to which it owes $44bn as a result of a loan to its conservative predecessor that failed to stabilise the economy. Martín Guzmán, the finance minister, says he hopes for agreement by March or April.
The deal with the bondholders did not restore Argentina's access to the international money markets, or confidence in the peso. The free-market exchange rate is now almost double the official rate (which has itself depreciated by around 25% since Mr Fernández took office). Critics complain that the government lacks an economic plan. It meanders between pragmatism-stressing exports and fiscal balance-and populism. It announced the expropriation of a big oilseed firm, only to change its mind. It is pushing through a swingeing wealth tax, of up to 3.5% on people with assets above $2.3m (at the official exchange rate).
""Imbalances in Argentina end either with rationality or an explosion,"" notes a seasoned politician. This time the road to rationality may be slow. Mr Guzmán has chosen ""a low-risk, low-reward equilibrium"", says Federico Sturzenegger, a former president of the Central Bank. The controls are buying time and may prevent an explosion. When the free-market peso plunged again in October, Mr Guzmán announced a reduction in moneyprinting. He has said he will cut the fiscal deficit from 11% of gdp this year to 4.5% in 2021. Pensions and public-sector wages are rising by less than inflation. The emergency aid will stop this month. ""They may surprise us positively on the fiscal side,"" says Mr Sturzenegger.
So far the Peronist coalition has remained united. But the Fernándezes' political marriage is palpably loveless. The vice-president has complained of government ""mistakes"" and ""functionaries who don't function"". She and the president talked, briefly, for the first time in 45 days at Maradona's wake. Her allies are trying to gain control of the judiciary. She is said to be furious that Mr Fernández has failed to halt corruption charges against her.
Economic recovery will be slow. The exchange controls and the wealth tax are discouraging investment. This year several multinationals (such as Walmart) have packed up. Much of the software industry has departed. Argentina, once Latin America's most developed country, likes to live by its own rules, although that has engendered a long decline. In that, too, Maradona represented his nation. He had ""so much football wealth that he thought he could squander it and it would not end"". That is Argentina, wrote Martin Caparros, an Argentine author, in El País, a Spanish newspaper. ""He fell, he got up, he fell again. He delighted in his past glories for lack of future ones: Argentina, perhaps."""

BEIRUT AND JERUSALEM
Joe Biden wants to re-enter the nuclear deal with Iran. Sounds simple, but he faces some big obstacles
THE ASSASSIN was not a human. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, erstwhile maestro of Iran's nuclear-weapons programme, was gunned down on November 27th by a remote-controlled machinegun mounted on an exploding pickup truck-if Fars, an Iranian news agency, is to be believed. ""No one was present at the scene,"" said Ali Shamkhani, the head of Iran's national security council. Other accounts suggest that gummen-human ones-were on the ground, and escaped. The bullets were certainly real.
Mr Fakhrizadeh, notionally a physics professor, was the brains behind Project Amad, Iran's clandestine pursuit of nuclear weapons from the 1980s to 2003. After Iran's leaders halted the formal programme, Mr Fakhrizadeh continued to dabble in dual-use research, presumably to keep alive the possibility of a bomb. Documents stolen by the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, suggest that 70% of Mr Fakhrizadeh's staff under Project Amad stayed with him in a new organisation.
That made him a marked man. Several of his underlings were killed in suspected Israeli hits from 2007 to 2012. When Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, presented the stolen files in 2018, he singled out Mr Fakhrizadeh by name. Israel's motive for killing him might have been to set back Iran's nuclear programme by eliminating its most experienced manager. But the likelier aim was to hobble the efforts of Joe Biden, America's president-elect, to resuscitate the nuclear deal signed between Iran and six world powers in 2015.
Under the deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (jcpoa), Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme and open itself up to rigorous inspections in return for the lifting of international sanctions. President Donald Trump called it the ""worst deal ever"", pulled America out of it in 2018 and has lashed Iran with sanction upon sanction. Iran responded in 2019 by attacking international shipping and striking Saudi Arabia with drones and missiles. It has also gradually violated the deal's provisions. Iran has now accumulated 12 times more enriched uranium than permitted- enough for a pair of bombs, if enriched further. It has also enriched some of that to higher levels of purity than allowed, conducted research on advanced centrifuges and moved some of them to an underground facility. But Iran has not substantially interfered with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (iaea), the UN's nuclear watchdog.
In theory, turning the clock back should be simple. Mr Biden says he will rejoin the jcpoa if Iran returns to compliance. Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, has said that if Mr Biden lifts sanctions ""we too can immediately return to our full commitments in the accord."" There will be a narrow window between Mr Biden taking office on January 20th and Iran's own presidential election on June 18th, notes Ilan Goldenberg of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington. ""The cleanest, easiest and simplest option is a mutual return to the jcpoa,"" he says. In practice, things could prove more complicated.
Start with Iran, whose leaders were initially delighted by Mr Biden's victory and the prospect of rejuvenated oil sales and trade. In meetings Mr Zarif excitedly repeated the name of John Kerry, Mr Biden's chosen climate envoy and Mr Zarif's opposite number during the negotiation of the jcpoa. Yet Mr Zarif is a member of Iran's pragmatist camp, which has been undermined by the failure of the jcpoa to deliver economic benefits.
Hardliners won a thumping victory in parliamentary elections in February (after many more moderate candidates were banned). They fear that a restoration of the nuclear deal would revive the fortunes of the pragmatists. Some want reparations for American sanctions. Mr Fakhrizadeh's assassination-met with lukewarm condemnation from Europe-has handed them more ammunition. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (irgc), Iran's principal military force, quickly rallied its proxies in parliament. On December 1st lawmakers passed a bill calling on the government to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade and, if certain American sanctions are not lifted soon, kick out the iaea's inspectors. Iran's defence minister said that the budget of Mr Fakhrizadeh's old organisation would double.
The JCPOA is viewed sceptically in America, Israel and the Gulf states, too. Critics point to three issues. One is its timeline (see chart). An arms embargo on Iran expired in October. Restrictions on advanced centrifuges and missile imports and exports will end, or ""sunset"", in three years. Most other restrictions will do so in a decade (though heightened iaea scrutiny will last for ever). A second grievance is Iran's burgeoning missile programme, the sophistication of which was displayed in January, when Iran retaliated for America's assassination of Qassem Suleimani, head of the irgc, with precise strikes on American troops in Iraq. A third is Iran's behaviour in the region, in particular its sponsorship of armed groups like Hizbullah, a Lebanese militia-cum-political party.
America's Israeli and Arab allies, along with many hawks in Washington, would like Mr Biden to wring concessions from Iran on these issues before rejoining the jcpoa. ""I think the balance of power has moved to the Americans,"" says Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, who points to unrelenting American sanctions and the killing of Suleimani, among other factors. Recent Israeli intelligence assessments concur that economic pressure has put Iran's regime in a position of ""unprecedented precariousness"".
Iran's economy is ""anaemic"" and inflation ""persistent"", says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of Bourse & Bazaar, a website that analyses Iran's economy. gdp shrank by 5.4% in 2018 and 6.5% in 2019, and will contract again this year (thanks in part to covid-19). That has led to protests. But it has not caused regime change, as some in the Trump administration hoped. ""We are far from the collapse scenario often discussed,"" says Mr Batmanghelidj. Firms that track tankers even claim that Iranian oil exports rose sharply in September in defiance of American sanctions. The state's ruthless security forces keep a lid on discontent. A year ago they killed hundreds of protesters in two days. ""I don't see any danger to internal stability,"" says an Iranian academic.
Mr Biden anyway rejects the idea of putting preconditions on a return to the jcpoa. ""Look, there's a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region,"" he told Thomas Friedman of the New York Times. But ""the best way to achieve getting some stability in the region"" is to deal ""with the nuclear programme."" Jake Sullivan, who will be Mr Biden's national security adviser, says other issues will be dealt with in later negotiations. The content and timing of such talks are up in the air, though they will probably involve fresh concessions on both sides- what diplomats call a ""more-for-more"" deal. Iran would probably seek access to dollars, an easing of energy and manufacturing sanctions and a legally binding agreement that could not be overturned as easily as Mr Trump sundered the jcpoa, says Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank.
America's priority should be to extend the sunset clauses on Iran's enrichment activity, suggests Gary Samore of Brandeis University, who served as Mr Obama's arms-control tsar from 2009 to 2013. Mr Yadlin says the sunsets should be extended to 30 years rather than 15, that iaea inspections should be ""everywhere"" with ""no limits"" and that Iran should be forced to divulge full details of its weapons-related work. ""If you collect these three, I will sleep better at night,"" he says. Mr Goldenberg suggests that because the sunsets are a decade away, America would be better off ""building out a regional dialogue"" between Iran and its rivals, using innocuous issues, such as co-operation against covid-19, as stepping stones to more contentious ones.
If Mr Biden simply returns to an unreconstructed jcpoa, or if subsequent talks go nowhere, he can expect stiff opposition from America's regional allies. ""If they bring to us an additional agreement that's the same quality as the jcpoa, we will do our best to change it,"" says an Israeli official. ""At the end of the day we will not rest until we have a better solution."" A confrontation between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Biden is ""inevitable"", says Raz Zimmt of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, a veteran Iran-watcher in Israeli intelligence. ""It's in Netanyahu's political interests to continue taking as hard a line as possible and no one in government or the security establishment can currently contradict him publicly.""
Mr Netanyahu has ample means of influencing the American and Iranian calculus. During the Obama administration the perennial threat of Israeli air strikes on Iran's nuclear programme was a major impetus for both sanctions and diplomacy. It led America to collaborate with Israel on a landmark cyber-attack, known as Stuxnet, on Iranian centrifuges. Along with the assassination of Mr Fakhrizadeh, Israel is thought to be responsible for a string of explosions at nuclear facilities over the summer. And it is putting pressure on Iran beyond its borders, too. ""Things are happening in Syria that did not happen in the past,"" says the Israeli official, coyly. ""Iranian equipment worth billions of dollars has been burned."" The latest suspected Israeli air strike in Syria was on November 29th, killing an Iranian commander on the border with Iraq.
Iran's Arab rivals are similarly worried, though less capable and more cautious. They have watched as Iran's regional influence has grown in Syria, Iraq and Yemen in the years since the jcpoa was signed. Their doubts about America deepened last year after Mr Trump's feeble response to an Iranian drone-and-missile attack on important Saudi oil facilities. These concerns have gradually driven into the open an Arab-Israeli axis. In August the United Arab Emirates (uae) established diplomatic ties with Israel. Bahrain followed a month later. Prince Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, is thought to have met Mr Netanyahu in November.
Arab states have little to offer Israel by way of muscle. They could allow Israeli warplanes to fly over their territory en route to Iran, and might share whatever intelligence the Mossad has not already gathered. More effective would be joint lobbying in Washington against the jcpoa. That would make it trickier for Mr Biden to fortify it, or any follow-on deal, with a legislative stamp of approval. Over time, though, Arab and Israeli interests may diverge. Israel's biggest concern is quelling Iran's nuclear activity. The Gulf states are most worried about Iran's regional influence.
They are also more vulnerable to escalation, should fresh sanctions or Israeli sabotage prompt Iran to lash out again. The uae may have the Arab world's best army, but an economy that relies on travel and trade- and imports almost all its necessities-can be easily disrupted. ""We're the first country across the water from Iran,"" says an Emirati diplomat. ""We always need to exercise deescalation."" The uae was notably quick to deplore Mr Fakhrizadeh's assassination and urge ""maximum restraint"".
In the short term Iran's leaders must decide whether and how to avenge Mr Fakhrizadeh's killing. Their response to Suleimani's death was theatrical but did not hurt America much. They know that striking Israel directly would risk incurring a severe response-perhaps even from Mr Trump, who could leave the fallout to his successor. An attack on one of Israel's new friends in the Gulf might send a message without provoking a war.
Yet some Iranian officials still counsel restraint in the hope of smoothing the path back to the jcpoa. After 30 years as supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is fading. The transition preoccupies his court. ""For continuity when the supreme leader dies, they need to get the oil revenues flowing again, and for that they need some kind of accommodation with the us,"" says the Iranian academic. Iran would not be averse to doubling the duration of the sunset clauses as part of a broader set of compromises, says Vali Nasr, a former State Department official. It may even agree to pull back from some regional conflicts, particularly Yemen. But it would probably want to see matching gestures from its Arab rivals. That would entail a level of trust that may be hard to reach."

Burundian refugees in Tanzania are tortured and forcibly sent home
EVEN AFTER Tanzanian policemen had hung him from the ceiling and beaten him with sticks, Crispin (not his real name) would not confess to being a rebel leader with plans to overthrow the government of neighbouring Burundi. It was only when they injected a liquid into his testicles that he caved in and said he was plotting a coup.
He was not. Some years ago Crispin was photographed at an anti-government protest in Burundi. Thugs from the ruling party's youth wing, the Imbonerakure (""those who see far""), painted a red cross on his door and turned up one night to threaten him. So in 2016 he fled to a refugee camp in western Tanzania. But men from the Imbonerakure also stalk the camps with lists of dissidents provided by Burundian intelligence. They target them, allegedly with help from Tanzanian police. Desperate families often pay the Imbonerakure to have their relatives freed. The spoils are shared with local cops. Most of those picked up are accused of hoarding weapons or plotting against Burundi's government.
In December last year men from the Imbonerakure turned up at Crispin's shelter flanked by Tanzanian policemen. They bundled him into a police car and took him to a cell where he spent three months. He was released only because his wife paid im Tanzanian shillings ($430) to the Imbonerakure. ""They said if she paid I would not be killed or returned to Burundi"" to face imprisonment, he says.
Others were not able to buy their way out. Human Rights Watch (hrw), a New York-based watchdog, interviewed 18 refugees who had been arrested in camps by Tanzanian policemen in the past year. Several had been tortured. Eight of them were forcibly returned to Burundi, where they have been locked up without charge. Another rights group, cbdh/vicar, based in Rwanda, says that about 170 Burundian refugees have disappeared from Tanzania since 2015. ""There seems to be collusion between the Tanzanian and Burundian authorities,"" says Mausi Segun of hrw. ""Several of those tortured were told that Tanzanian officials had information on them from Burundi.""
About 300,000 Burundians have fled their country since 2015 after violence broke out when the then president, Pierre Nkurunziza, said he would stand for an unconstitutional third term. Hundreds were killed. Activists, journalists and anyone who might have been spotted at a protest rushed to neighbouring countries. Around half of them went to Tanzania.
A new president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, was elected in June in a rigged poll. His government is just as scary. Gervais Ndirakobuca, the new security minister, is nicknamed ""Ndakugarika"", meaning ""I will kill you"" in Kirundi, the local language. He earned his reputation as a rebel commander during the civil war and has worked hard to maintain it since. As police commissioner under the former president, who has since died, he was responsible for some of the bloodiest crackdowns on protesters. Because of this the eu and America have imposed sanctions on him.
With such people in the government, few refugees seem likely to believe its assurance that the country is safe and that they should return. Officials in Tanzania and Burundi drew up a secret agreement that was leaked last year. It said all refugees should ""return to their country of origin whether voluntarily or not"". Some 50,000 have gone back in the past two years. Many cite insecurity in the camps, in particular arbitrary arrests, as their reason for returning. Moreover, camp authorities have threatened Burundians, saying that if they do not sign up to go home they will lose their refugee status and risk arrest. Some of those returning say that they were threatened or detained when they crossed the border. Many have fled again, but this time into safer Uganda.
Crispin has no choice but to stay in Tanzania. He has been warned by the Imbonerakure that if he tries to leave for another neighbouring country, he will be stopped at the border and sent back to Burundi. ""It is terrifying to live in a country where you can be arrested at any time. I am constantly frightened,"" he said. ""But there is nowhere for me to go."""

ABUJA
Why Boko Haram murdered 78 farmers
THE FARMERS-43 of them-were found in the rice fields where they had gone to work. Some had their throats slit. Others were beheaded. In the days that followed locals found evidence of yet more butchery, taking the toll to 78. Boko Haram, a jihadist group that has been fighting since 2009 to carve out a caliphate in north-east Nigeria, was quick to claim credit for the murders. It said they were revenge for the capture of a militant by locals.
The people of north-east Nigeria have grown wearily accustomed to the horrors of Boko Haram, whose name is loosely translated as ""Western education is forbidden"". The group has been known to strap ticking bombs to children before sending them into markets and mosques. Its abduction of more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok in 2014 became emblematic of the many failures of President Goodluck Jonathan's administration. He was defeated in an election the following year by Muhammadu Buhari, a former general who promised to restore security.
Yet the latest killings-and the government's ham-fisted response to them-have rekindled outrage among Nigerians. Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari's spokesman, initially blamed the victims, saying they had not been given permission from the army to go to the farm. An army spokesman accused them of collaborating with the insurgents and not tipping off the security forces.
But one survivor said they had told soldiers that jihadists were in the area. After the farmers nabbed one and handed him over, many feared Boko Haram would retaliate. When it did, the army was nowhere to be seen.
The government is unable to provide security in large swathes of the countryside. Jihadists are not the only scourge. Bandits loot villages in northern and central Nigeria, and kidnap for ransom. Many farmers have abandoned their homes and crops. ""We will not have food sufficiency because people are afraid of going to their farms,"" says the head of a farmers' association.
Mr Buhari won a second term last year, largely thanks to the votes of rural northerners. Their support now seems to be dwindling. That may not matter much to a term-limited 77-year-old. But it matters to his party. Allies are pleading with him to fire his army chief. Mr Buhari remains remote and passive, however, even as his country burns."

ADDIS ABABA
Tigray's ousted rulers flee to the mountains
THE BATTLE, in the end, was mercifully short. The 500,000 inhabitants of Mekelle, the capital of Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray, were spared a large-scale bloodbath. On November 28th Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's prime minister, declared victory over Tigray's ruling party, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (tplf). A military operation that had started a few weeks earlier was complete, he said. Shelling of the city began at about ten that morning. By the evening Tigray's president, Debretsion Gebremichael, and other leaders had vanished into the mountains. Crowds in the national capital, Addis Ababa, broke into celebration.
But the fighting has not stopped. ""Almost all the Tigrayan forces are outside the big towns and cities,"" says a tplf intelligence officer, explaining that they had withdrawn when Ethiopian forces started shelling towns. Only hours after Abiy's announcement of victory, rockets were fired for the third time from Tigray into Eritrea, a country to its north that has been helping Ethiopian forces. There have since been reports of sporadic clashes and air raids, as well as looting in towns, including Mekelle. ""We have a plan to retake our towns from the invaders,"" Debretsion told The Economist by text message.
The fog of Ethiopia's month-long civil war has thickened since it was declared over. Speaking to parliament on November 30th, Abiy claimed that not a single civilian life had been lost during the march into Tigray. The un and the more than 40,000 refugees who have fled to Sudan reckon otherwise. Hospitals in the regional capital are flooded with injured people. Medical supplies for the wounded and body bags for the dead are running low. But a communications blackout imposed on the region since the start of the conflict means it is impossible to know the true figure. Counter-claims that tplf forces downed a jet and recaptured the town of Axum are also unverified.
Harder to dispute is the federal government's claim that it has the upper hand in the conflict. In the weeks before it fired the first shots on November 4th, the tplf believed it would easily win a conventional war against the Ethiopian army. The retreat from Mekelle has put paid to that hubris. The tplf does not seem to have counted on the government's use of drones, for instance, which are thought to have been devastatingly effective. And it seems to have misjudged its ability to fight on several fronts, including one against even the small number of Eritreans thought to have attacked it along the northern frontier. ""The tplf totally overestimated at least their conventional force,"" reckons René Lefort, a researcher who has known some of its leaders for decades.
The question now is whether it can sustain a prolonged guerrilla war. Its leaders certainly have a wealth of experience: in 1991 they overthrew a dictatorship in Addis Ababa after 17 gruelling years in the bush. For almost three decades after that they called the shots in the federal government, which means they know its vulnerabilities. Keeping the army tied up in Tigray may be enough to weaken Abiy's control elsewhere. His home region of Oromia, for instance, is racked by an armed insurgency.
But many of the veterans of the tplf's bush war are now in their 60s and 70s. They also have few allies left in the region. The once porous border with Sudan, a lifeline in the 1970s and 1980s, has largely been sealed. On November 29th Sudanese security forces seized a large cache of weapons and ammunition en route to Tigray. ""What happens when they run out of bullets?"" asks a un diplomat. ""How do they expect to bring fuel trucks up long, winding roads without any air cover?""
Much will depend on whether Abiy can win over ordinary Tigrayans. His government promises to rebuild towns and villages battered by war. It also says it is welcoming back refugees. But many of those who fled, the vast majority of whom are Tigrayan, say they fear reprisals if they come back. Most are from western Tigray, which is now run by police and bureaucrats from the neighbouring Amhara region. Amhara claims this territory as its own. Its militiamen fought alongside the federal army in battles that reportedly saw some of the war's worst atrocities. Militias on both sides appear to have targeted civilians, including at least 600 allegedly massacred by a youth group of the tplf. Abiy may have won. But he still has a bitterly divided country to heal."

TAOYUAN
Covid-19 has ravaged economies all over the world-but not Taiwan's
THREE YEARS ago a prominent scholar declared that Taiwan's economy was ""on the brink of death"". The wording was extreme but the sentiment was widely shared. Taiwan faced a litany of seemingly intractable problems. Many of its best companies had moved to China; wages were stagnant; growth was grinding ever lower and the population was ageing rapidly. Its glory days as an Asian tiger-celebrated for its rapid development-seemed firmly in the past.
Yet in 2020 Taiwan has turned the clock back: it is, again, one of the world's fastestgrowing economies. Granted, its gdp is projected to expand by only about 2% this year. But it is in rare company, with fewer than a dozen economies expected to grow at all, thanks to the coronavirus. For the first time in decades, Taiwan's economy may even grow faster than China's. The question is whether Taiwan's surprising strength marks a new departure, or whether it is simply a brief deviation from continued descent.
Two factors tied to the pandemic help account for Taiwan's relative success this year. First, it was the only country to contain covid-19 without sweeping closures of schools, offices and shops. Its government, alert to new diseases in China, started screening visitors from Wuhan at the end of 2019, as soon as reports emerged of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak. Thanks to fine-grained contact-tracing and nearuniversal mask-wearing, life has carried on more or less as normal. Since July revenues for retailers and restaurants alike have increased compared with a year earlier.
Second, Taiwan's manufacturers have been well-positioned to cater to global demand, such as it is. From tiny semiconductors to giant computer servers, electronics account for a third of Taiwan's exports. With so many people suddenly forced to work from home, sales of products such as tablet computers and headphones have been strong. So while global trade this year will shrink by about 10%, Taiwan's exports are up by nearly 5%.
Both these sources of out-performance will presumably fade when the pandemic ebbs. Taiwan has also, however, been a beneficiary of tensions between China and America. Taiwanese firms that had previously invested in China have shifted some of their operations back home, in order to avoid American tariffs. Those returning include Giant, a bicycle producer, Long Chen, a paper company, and Compal, a computer manufacturer. Investments in factories and other fixed assets in Taiwan reached an all-time high last year of over NT$4trn ($i40bn), and are on track for a new record this year (see chart on next page).
The clanging reverberating through Hwa Ya Technology Park in Taoyuan, a big city in the north of the island, is evidence of the construction boom. Quanta Computer, one of the world's biggest electronics manufacturers, is stepping up domestic production of sophisticated servers that it once made in China. And workers are tearing down blue plastic scaffolding covering an even larger server factory being built for NT$i5bn ($525m). ""It will be ready quickly,"" a helmeted worker says cheerfully.
Some in Taiwan worry that this momentum, catalysed by Donald Trump's trade policies, will fizzle out when Joe Biden enters the White House. Although Mr Biden has pledged to take a hard line on China, he may be willing to roll back tariffs. But Gordon Sun of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research thinks Taiwanese companies will continue to diversify away from China. ""They cannot afford to get caught in another trade war, even if the possibility is low,"" he says.
The return to Taiwan, if sustained, would partly address one of the concerns hanging over its future: the relentless migration of good companies and good jobs to China. Some 400,000 Taiwanese, about 2% of the population, now live across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese businesses speak with trepidation about the emergence of a ""red supply chain"" in China that will soon challenge the likes of Foxconn, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer which makes most of Apple's iPhones. Competition from China has also contributed to anaemic wage-growth in Taiwan. Adjusted for inflation, salaries have been flat since 2000, averaging just under $20,000 a year.
Yet the surge in investment in Taiwan has clear limits. President Tsai Ing-wen often refers to the country's ""five shortages"", shorthand for its finite supply of land, water, power, workers and talent. Only so much can be done on a small island that is committed to phasing out nuclear power and that has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Taiwan's population is set to start shrinking this year, and the government forecasts that it will drop from 24m today to 16m in 2070.
Added to these chronic woes are the hard realities of Taiwan's reliance on China. Nearly 40% of Taiwan's exports go to China and Hong Kong. ""Taiwan can't just get rid of China's economy and search for other growth engines,"" says Chen Chien-liang, an economist who served under the previous administration, which tried to draw closer to China.
The saving grace for Taiwan is that China needs Taiwanese products as much as Taiwanese firms need the Chinese market. Chinese firms are still far from matching the wizardry of tsmc, the Taiwanese company that churns out the world's most advanced semiconductors. China has done little worse to the Taiwanese economy recently than limit the flow of tourists from the mainland (ironically, this may have helped insulate Taiwan from covid-19). America may in fact do more damage if it promulgates new rules that prevent tsmc from working with Chinese customers such as Huawei, a telecoms giant.
For Liang Kuo-yuan of the Yuanta-Polaris Research Institute the economic prescription for Taiwan is simple, if tough to pull off. The island must make itself as indispensable in industries such as medical devices and batteries, he says, as it has in semiconductors. Such high-value niches will help protect Taiwan from Chinese pressure, and will also fit with Taiwan's limited resources and falling population.
A single year of impressive growth does not move Taiwan closer to that objective. Mr Liang, for one, frets that China is outdoing Taiwan in its long-term economic planning. But stellar performance in this most challenging year has at least given many in Taiwan a shot of confidence, after years of gloom. Across the road from the Hwa Ya Technology Park in Taoyuan, Chris Liang runs a small restaurant. Among his customers from tech firms, the change in sentiment has been almost palpable, he says. ""Our epidemic control has changed people's attitudes about the economy. People are more optimistic."""

DELHI
The super-rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer
Some people have almost all the luck. Over the past year, as India's economy has shrunk by around a tenth and tens of millions of Indians have lost jobs or sunk into poverty, the fortunes of the country's two richest people have swollen. Gautam Adani, whose conglomerate sprawls from ports to coal mines to food, has seen his personal wealth more than double, to some $32bn. Mukesh Ambani's riches, which derive from oil refining, telecoms and retail, among other things, have grown by just 25%, albeit to an intimidating $75bn or so.
The share of wealth and income going to the top 1% has been rising rapidly in recent years in India, as it has been in many countries. Last year they hoovered up 21.4% of earnings, just ahead of their counterparts in Russia, according to the World Inequality Database. Credit Suisse, a bank, puts their share of India's wealth at 39%, well ahead of the richest 1% of Americans or Chinese. Most alarmingly, in India some of the rich have become super-rich by using their heft to crush smaller competitors and thus corner multiple chunks of the economy. The tilt in fortunes has rewarded not so much technical innovation or productivity growth or the opening of new markets as the wielding of political influence and privileged access to capital to capture and protect existing markets.
Merely a decade ago, according to data compiled by Marcellus, an investment-advice firm, among listed firms in India the 20 most profitable generated less than a third of profits. They now account for 70%. A study by Krishna Kant, a journalist, reveals that between 2014 and 2018 competition within ten different industries, from aviation to tyres, deteriorated markedly.
Across Indian markets, only the shares of giant firms have gained consistently over the past decade, says Rohit Chandra of iit Delhi, a university. International investors have noticed, and now bet increasingly not on promising new firms but on big old ones, which they expect to get even bigger. The government boasts that the five months from April to August saw a record $36bn in foreign investment, suggesting that its wise policies have sustained confidence during the covid-19 epidemic. What it trumpets less loudly is that more than half of that money, including hefty investments from Facebook and Google, poured into Mr Ambani's hands alone.
It is easy to understand why. Things have a way of turning out as Mr Ambani wishes. Back in 2016, for instance, the tycoon used his massive earnings from petrochemicals to take a $25bn gamble, plunging into the maturing mobile-phone market. His timing was exquisite. Just as he rolled out a free service to lure customers, the government withdrew 86% of the country's paper currency, leaving most of India strapped for cash and eager to find savings. Rival companies also found themselves burdened by lawsuits and crushing penalties for back taxes. Regulators ignored complaints. ""If his firm were Chinese it would have been charged with dumping,"" says one economist.
Mr Adani enjoys a similar Midas touch. In early 2019 his group, which controls around a quarter of India's port capacity, ventured into a new field when the government tendered six 50-year airport-management contracts. Competing against established firms, Mr Adani nevertheless won all six. He has since bought two more, including a 74% share in Mumbai airport, India's second-busiest. More recently, Mr Adani has counterbalanced big stakes in coal-fired power with lots of renewable energy, winning a $6bn government contract in June for various solar projects. The share price of Adani Green Energy, a subsidiary, has risen tenfold since March.
Some of India's tycoons have prospered because they have learned not just to weather unpredictability, but to game the system. That system, alas, is failing India's poor. Measures of malnutrition and stunting reveal an alarming backward slide over the past year. The unemployment rate shows some recovery from the worst of the covid shock, but that fails to capture the astonishing bleakness of India's labour market. Before covid hit, barely 40% of adults were in paid work, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a research firm. Now only 36% are. The rest, including legions of housewives, see no point in even looking for a job. *"

MUSWELLBROOK
As the federal government harrumphs, the country is moving away from coal
IF A COAL-FREE future awaits the town of Muswellbrook, in New South Wales, there is little sign of it. It is surrounded by vast canyons of grey and brown rock- open-cast coal mines. Nearby, two huge power plants burn their output for electricity. More is piled onto sooty trains which rumble constantly through the town, conveying its riches east, to the port of Newcastle, from which the coal is shipped across Asia.
According to Muswellbrook's mayor, Martin Rush, the surrounding region is the source of more than a tenth of the world's internationally traded thermal coal (the sort burnt in power plants, as opposed to coking coal, which is used to make steel). Fully one third of locals rely on the stuff for well-paid work. The problem is that, in the next five years, three of the area's mines will close. So will one of the ancient power stations, as utilities replace coal with cheaper, cleaner energy. Mr Rush reckons that it will take ""between 20 and 30 years"" for the local industry to die out altogether. Some miners hope for longer. Either way, says Mike Kelly of the local chamber of commerce, no one denies that the longterm trend is down.
The same realisation is dawning across Australia. Its three biggest export markets for fossil fuels-China, Japan and South Korea-have all recently pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by the middle of the century or just after. Another buyer of Australian coal, the Philippines, has banned new coal-fired power plants.
The federal government, a right-wing coalition, appears in denial about this changing outlook. Scott Morrison, the prime minister, insists he is ""not concerned about our future exports"". When anz, a bank, said in October that it would stop funding new coal mines, coal-loving mps griped that it was ""virtue-signalling"" and called for a boycott. (Australia's three other big banks had already pledged to steer clear of coal.) A government minister told pension funds, which are also selling sooty investments, that their goal should be to maximise returns and ""not to change the earth's temperature"".
The politicians' misgivings are understandable. Coal is Australia's second-biggest export, bringing in almost A$70bn ($49bn) in 2019. It also provides two-thirds of its electricity. The industry's hold over politics is such that three of Mr Morrison's four most recent predecessors lost power after trying to curb the country's emissions of greenhouse gases.
Yet even right-wingers in the federal parliament harp on less than they used to about the need to open new mines or subsidise coal-fired power stations, notes Greg Bourne of the Climate Council, a green pressure group. And while they may have prevented the federal government from taking steps to curb the use of coal, they cannot prevent Australia's states and territories from trying to. In fact, every one of them has set a target of reducing net emissions to zero by 2050, although Mr Morrison refuses to do so. The tiny Australian Capital Territory, host to Mr Morrison's government in Canberra, already generates all its power from clean sources. In October South Australia became, for an hour, the world's first big jurisdiction to run only on solar power.
But it is a state run by the same coalition as the federal government, New South Wales, that has the most ambitious plan to decarbonise, notes Simon Holmes å Court of Melbourne University. It has pledged to underwrite 12 gigawatts of clean-energy projects and a further two gigawatts of energy storage to back them up over the next ten years. That would be enough to power several smaller states on its own.
The state's energy minister, Matt Kean, won support from the coal lobby in the coalition by promising A$32bn of investment in regions that will need it as mining declines. When the legislation passed the state parliament in late November, only One Nation, a populist party, opposed it. Mr Kean takes this as a sign that ""we have wrested back control"" from ""the coal barons that have decided energy policy in this country for generations"".
Miners, though, argue that these grand green plans will inevitably lead to higher power prices and thus crimp economic growth. Ditch coal, and all Australians ""will have to downgrade their lifestyle"", says Gus Mather, who makes equipment for the mines. Muswellbrook is planning multiple clean-energy schemes, from pumped-hydro to biofuels. But Mr Rush, the mayor, worries that no coal town has ever managed to stop digging the stuff up and remain prosperous."

TOKYO
A crash in tourism means no one is feeding the sacred deer of Nara
The more than 13m tourists who visit Nara, an ancient capital of Japan, each year tend to follow a well-worn path. On their way into a park at the edge of the city they pass the towering wooden pagoda of Kofuku-ji, a temple complex founded in 710. They continue to nearby Todai-ji, gazing in awe at Japan's largest Buddha, a bronze behemoth weighing 400 tons and standing 15 metres tall. And finally they feed shika senbei, a special kind of rice cracker, to the sacred deer, some 1,300 of which live in the park.
The deer, though wild, have come to love the crackers. With tourism reduced to a trickle because of the pandemic, they are hungry. Many have begun wandering far from home in search of food. A recent study by the Nara Deer Preservation Foundation and Tatsuzawa Shirow of Hokkaido University shows that 20% fewer are spending their days in the park; incidents of damage caused by deer in town have shot up. The less enterprising ones, apparently accustomed to eating only crackers, have become emaciated.
The deer are not the only ones going hungry. So are businesses in places like Nara, which have come to rely ever more heavily on tourism in recent years. Fewer than 7m foreign tourists visited Japan in 2009; last year some 32m did. Revenue from tourism hit a record 4.8trn yen ($46bn). With the Olympics scheduled for this past summer, Japan had hoped to welcome 40m foreigners this year. Instead, after a near-total closure of its borders because of the pandemic, arrivals have dropped by 99.4%.
The government has tried to cushion the blow by encouraging its own citizens to get out more. The Diet earmarked ¥1.35trn ($12.9bn) for ""Go To Travel"" subsidies, which provide discounts of up to 35% at domestic hotels and inns; a concurrent programme called ""Go To Eat"" applies to restaurants. The ministry of tourism says nearly 40m nights have been booked under the programme since it was launched in July. That is a pyrrhic victory: the campaign is thought to have contributed to a recent uptick in covid-19. Daily cases reached a record of 2,680 on November 28th. Suga Yoshihide, Japan's prime minister, recently announced that the subsidies would be suspended in areas with high caseloads. In addition, older Japanese have been asked not to make use of them.
Japan is loth to give up on tourism, or to let the infrastructure that supports it wither. (Mr Suga himself championed tourism as chief cabinet secretary to his predecessor, Abe Shinzo.) Officials see spending by foreign visitors as a means to compensate for Japan's own shrinking population. Tourism may also help make Japan more open to foreign migrants in the future, says Saito Jun of the Japan Centre for Economic Research, a think-tank in Tokyo.
Meanwhile, the more resourceful deer in Nara have reverted to a healthier diet of plants and nuts, which has been good for their insides. Their droppings, made pale and runny by the crackers, have become firmer and darker again. If only belt-tightening were as good for the economy. *"

More relatives of politicians are entering the family business
When joko widodo was elected president of Indonesia in 2014, it marked a turning-point in the country's politics. Jokowi, as he is better known, hails from a humble background-he grew up in a riverside shack-yet managed to vault himself into the nation's highest office. It was the first time that somebody who did not belong to the political or military elite was in charge of the country. True to his image as an outsider, he vowed that budding politicians in his family would not ride on his coat-tails, writing in his autobiography, published in 2018, that ""becoming a president does not mean channelling power to my children"".
But since his re-election last year, Jokowi seems to have had a change of heart. Both his son and son-in-law, neither of them with any experience in politics, are running in regional elections on December 9th under the banner of Jokowi's party, the pdi-p. His son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is running for mayor of the city of Surakarta, the job that was his father's political launchpad. Mr Gibran is so far ahead of his opponent in the polls that December 9th will be less an election, more a coronation.
Jokowi is unusual only in his initial refusal to smooth the way for his offspring. Since the advent of democracy in 1998, and the devolution of power from central to local governments shortly after that, politicians have sought to establish dynasties. A growing number are doing so at the local level. In elections held in 2015, 52 candidates, or 3% of the total, were related to politicians who currently or previously led a regency (county), city or province, according to Yoes Kenawas, who studies dynasticism in Indonesian politics. In next week's local elections, nearly three times as many candidates-about 10% of the total-have family connections.
Jokowi's son and son-in-law are not the only people with ties to the presidential palace to have entered the fray. The vicepresident's daughter, who is running for mayor of South Tangerang, a city abutting Jakarta, the capital, is competing against the niece of the defence minister. In eastern Java the 28-year-old son of Jokowi's cabinet secretary is running for regent.
This is the first time that so many relatives of national figures are running in local elections, according to Mr Yoes. Many of those national figures are themselves dynasts. The defence minister, Prabowo Subianto, was married for a long time to a daughter of Suharto, Indonesia's dictator of 31 years. Suharto came to power by overthrowing Sukarno, Indonesia's first president. Sukarno's daughter, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was president from 2001 to 2004, and remains the head of the pdi-p.
The Indonesian public is put off by the cosiness of its political class, so much so that in 2015 the national parliament passed a law barring the relatives of incumbents from running for regent, mayor or governor. The law was deemed unconstitutional by the courts and overturned later that year, yet the public's distaste persists: nearly 61% of those surveyed in July by Kompas, a local magazine, disapproved of relatives of politicians running for regional offices.
Yet politicians keep trying to entrench power within their families-often because the opportunities to make money that come with a political office are too good to turn down. Political parties do little to discourage nepotism. They are, after all, animated by personalities, not by policies, points out Ben Bland of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Australia. They therefore need politicians with name recognition to propel them to victory: better the relative of a somebody than a nobody.
Plus, candidates must bear the cost of campaigning, which is becoming ever more exorbitant. Parties therefore need candidates who either have deep pockets themselves or know people who do. The prohibitive cost of running for office means that ""it is virtually impossible"" for those without means or ""connections with established patronage networks to prevail"", says Vedi Hadiz of the University of Melbourne in Australia.
It is up to the ""smart and discerning"" Indonesian public to decide whether his son is fit for office, Jokowi told the bbc earlier this year. But the high cost of campaigning and the associated preponderance of wellconnected candidates mean that a growing share of those running for office come from the same background, winnowing the options available to voters. Many would-be politicians doubtless balk at pitting themselves against an opponent backed by a powerful family.
Take Mr Gibran. He risked running unopposed, which would have underscored the perception that he was coasting on his father's reputation. Heroically, somebody threw his hat into the ring at the last minute: Bagyo Wahyono, a tailor. He says he had no desire to run in the election-""I actually don't like politics,"" he told a local magazine. The chairman of the organisation funding his campaign denies the allegation that Mr Bagyo is a ""puppet"" of the pdi-p, put up to ensure Mr Gibran had some competition. If smart and discerning voters have doubts about that, it is not clear how they can express them."

BIRTH IS THE obvious place to start a life story, but how can Mishima Yukio's not begin with death? That of Japan's finest author of the 20th century was both spectacular and absurd.
On November 25th 1970, Mishima led members of his private army into the main military base in the centre of Tokyo and launched a ""coup"" patently intended to fail. The commander was taken hostage. In white headband and a uniform that a biographer, Damian Flanagan, describes as easily mistaken for a bell boy's, Mishima stepped out onto a balcony and called upon the hundreds of members of the Self-Defence Forces (sdf) below to revolt and tear up Japan's pacifist constitution. Imposed by American occupiers, it had diminished the standing of the emperor and forbidden a conventional army (and still does). ""Aren't you samurai? If you are samurai, why do you defend a constitution that rejects you?"" The soldiers responded with cries of ""Fuckwit!""
Back in the commandant's office, Mishima, a stickler for timekeeping, removed his watch and prepared for seppuku, or ritual suicide. Kneeling, he pushed his short sword into the left side of his intestines and, grunting, moved it across. A first accomplice was to complete the suicide with a swift beheading but messed up-Mishima's overdeveloped neck muscles from years of physical training did not help. A second delivered the final cut. Then the first disembowelled himself and was beheaded in turn. The front page of the evening edition of Asahi Shimbun showed the two heads on the carpet next to the scabbard of the long sword.
Many Japanese remember exactly where they were on hearing the news. Mishima was the author of 34 limpid novels, more than 70 plays and scores of lighter tales for a mass market. He was Japan's first media supasuta (superstar). He acted in films and posed as a model. He had sought illumination in India a year before the Beatles. He had sharp sartorial sense and twinkling wit. He topped Heibon Punch magazine's Mr Dandy awards.
Yet Mishima's commemoration was long the preserve of right-wing fanatics. For all his cosmopolitanism, in his later years Mishima embraced the notion that a Japanese life should only be lived through worship of the emperor. His ideal, he told a hall of left-wing students at University of Tokyo in 1969 was how, before the second world war, the word ""emperor"" had once ""prefaced all intentions"".
Mishima was born into a stifling household: his domineering grandmother cocooned him indoors and his father destroyed his writings. He came of age just before Japan's defeat in 1945. His generation was taught to sacrifice the most beautiful thing they had-their lives-for the emperor. But when called up, puny Mishima failed his medical. Hirano Keiichiro, a novelist, says ""survivor's guilt"" played a big part in his militarism.
Fused to it was his obsession with pleasure, pain and homoeroticism. In one of his greatest novels, ""The Temple of the Golden Pavilion"", a monk burns a temple because it is too beautiful. Mishima, in turn, was building his body for a final sacrifice.
Yet Mishima's life-defining death channelled the nihilism of Nietzsche more than anything essentially Japanese. The act mattered as much as the word. Mishima had no time for intellectuals who never left their towers, says Roger Pulvers, an author and translator. The uncovered footage of Mishima's debate with the students, at the height of huge anti-American and anti-establishment protests, was recently made into a documentary, ""Mishima: the Last Debate"". ""If you'd mentioned 'Emperor' just once,"" Mishima declares at one point, ""I'd have joined your cause. Gladly.""
Younger Japanese have flocked to see the documentary. Mishima's books are selling well too. That would have pleased him. But he would have been appalled at the prospect of people ""placidly enjoying...lockdown thanks to Zoom, Netflix and Uber Eats, totally comfortable with the prospect of a future controlled by artificial intelligence and big data"", as Peter Tasker, a pundit based in Tokyo, puts it in Nikkei Asia, alluding to Nietzsche's ""last man"".
Many wonder how things might have been, had Mishima survived. In one novel, Oe Kenzaburo, a Nobel laureate, has Mishima released from prison after 30 years to become the leader of a 21stcentury cult. If that is not as far-fetched as his actual death, then Mishima has made sure, as he knew he would, that he would always have the last word."

A new law would unshackle China's coastguard, far from its coast
The zhaotou-class cutter may be a lowly coastguard ship. But it is no pushover. At 12,000 tonnes, it is the world's largest vessel built for such use. It looms over most American or Japanese destroyers. Its roomy deck accommodates two helicopters, a 76mm gun and a thicket of other weaponry. China has two of them. One is deployed on its east coast. The newest, CCG 3901 (the letters stand for ""China Coast Guard""), set sail in 2017 on its maiden patrol of the South China Sea, its designated sphere of operation. Nowhere around China's shores are waters more contested. The arrival of the behemoth is intended to make a point: China backs its claims in that area with a panoply of steel.
Soon CCG 3901 will have extra ammunition. In November China published a draft law that would empower the coastguard to demolish other countries' structures built on Chinese-claimed reefs, and to board and expel foreign vessels. In some circumstances it could even fire on hostile ships. The deadline for public comment expired as The Economist went to press.
Over the past decade, the seas around China have been roiled by rival activity and enmity. In the East China Sea, Chinese vessels have been probing waters around the Japanese-held Senkaku islands-uninhabited outcrops which China also claims (and calls the Diaoyu). In the South China Sea China has turned disputed reefs into island fortresses. America and its allies have in turn sent a growing parade of warships to challenge China's claims there. China's navy, the world's largest, has been ever more active, too. But its coastguard, also the world's largest, has become increasingly important in this contest.
In 2013 China merged several civilian maritime law-enforcement agencies into a new unified one, called the Chinese Coastguard Bureau. Five years later this was put under the command of the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force that reports to the Central Military Commission, the country's supreme military body. In effect, this turned China's coastguard into a branch of the armed forces-much like its counterparts in America and India.
It has also benefited from a shipbuilding spree. Today China's coastguard has more than 500 ships. In the region, Japan is a distant second with 373. Others trail far behind. Taiwan has 161, the Philippines 86 and Indonesia a mere 41. China's ships have got beefier, too. A decade ago China had just ten vessels with a full-load displacement of at least 1,500 tonnes (about the size of a small warship). By 2015 it had 51 such ships. Today it has 87, says the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a Londonbased think-tank.
Many of the coastguard's ships now dwarf the largest warships in the region's smallest navies. The most capable, says Olli Suorsa of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (rsis) in Singapore, are ""essentially navy ships painted white"", minus the missiles (though that is also true of Japan's coastguard). The Type 818 patrol ship, for instance, is a modified version of the Chinese navy's Type 054A frigate. Such large ships are less agile than smaller ones, but they convey suitable menace.
That comes in handy, for China uses its coastguard not only for routine maritime law-enforcement-such as catching smugglers-but also to project power. When China dispatched the hd8, a survey vessel, to Vietnam's exclusive economic zone last year, it sent a flotilla of coastguard ships, including the CCG 3901, as back-up. Some blocked Vietnamese coastguard ships from approaching. When the hd8 was sent to Malaysian economic waters in April, the CCG 3901 tagged along again. A report published last year by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, found that 14 Chinese coastguard vessels patrolling disputed features in the South China Sea had broadcast their location on the Automated Identification System, an international ship-tracking network, to demonstrate a ""routine, highly visible Chinese presence"". The Chinese coastguard's near-constant vigil in the South China Sea has been helped by the supplies it receives from China's newly built outposts there.
In the East China Sea, coastguard ships have spent a record number of days this year near the Senkakus. In October two of its vessels sailed in the islands' territorial waters (ie, less than 12 nautical miles from shore) and stayed for longer than 39 hours, the previous record.
Sometimes the coastguard is used in support of China's ""maritime militia"" of armed fishing vessels, which the country uses to establish a presence in disputed waters. In April Vietnam accused China's coastguard of ramming and sinking a Vietnamese fishing vessel near the Paracel islands in the South China Sea, to which both countries lay claim. It was the second such incident there in less than a year.
America worries about the Chinese coastguard's growing role as an enhancer of Chinese maritime power. Last year an American admiral hinted that, in the event of a clash, America's navy would treat vessels belonging to China's coastguard and maritime militia no differently from those of its navy. In October America said it would explore the viability of deploying its own coastguard vessels to American Samoa, in the South Pacific, to counter China's ""illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and harassment of vessels"".
China has reacted huffily to other countries' concerns about the draft coastguard law. To some extent, it is right to be miffed. Most of the bill's provisions match those of laws elsewhere and accord with international norms, says Collin Koh of rsis.
But there is every reason to worry about the Chinese law's proposed scope. It covers China's ""jurisdictional waters"", a term that the country applies to most of the South China Sea, says Ryan Martinson of the us Naval War College. Most of those waters are claimed by other countries or regarded as part of the global commons. China's sweeping assertion of rights there was largely rejected in 2016 by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an international tribunal in The Hague. Article 22 of the draft bill would allow China's coastguard to create ""temporary exclusion zones"", potentially cordoning off swathes of open ocean.
According to Mr Koh, the Chinese coastguard has been complaining for years that it needs such a law to give it more clout in its dealings with rival forces in the South China Sea. The coastguard is ""powerful"", says Hu Bo, director of the Beijing-based South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a think-tank. But, he adds, it has a ""heavy task"". In 2016, when Indonesia's navy fired on a Chinese fishing boat and detained its crew, the coastguard felt powerless to respond-worried, apparently, that using force without explicit legal backing might harm China's image. ""It was a big failure,"" says Mr Martinson. ""There was likely a lot of soul-searching after that."" The new law will serve notice that the white-hulls may shoot back."

HONG KONG
With opposition silenced, the decks are clear for a massive building project
WHEN HONG KONG'S legislature was stripped last month of an opposition after the government expelled four pro-democracy lawmakers and the remaining 15 resigned in sympathy, many in the territory feared this would allow the passage of controversial bills with a minimum of critical scrutiny. In the coming weeks, one proposed law is likely to prove that such worries are justified.
The bill would permit the spending of HK$55om ($7im) on a feasibility study for the biggest infrastructure project ever proposed in the city. The scheme, Lantau Tomorrow Vision, would involve creating 17 square kilometres of artificial land off Lantau, Hong Kong's largest island. The government says housing built on this, much of it subsidised, could accommodate up to 1.1m people-about one-seventh of the current population. The estimated price tag is at least HK$624bn. Critics say the project is unnecessary, expensive and threatens rare species, including the pink dolphin.
In her annual policy address on November 25th, Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, said the scheme would ""bring enormous economic benefits to Hong Kong"". It would also please the authorities in mainland China. They see it as a catalyst for their own ""Greater Bay Area"" idea for building Hong Kong and nearby cities inland into a giant metropolis. Shenzhen, the mainland city closest to Hong Kong, wants a high-speed rail link with the Lantau project.
Some developers would like to go further. The Hong Kong Real Property Federation, a lobby group, has suggested that the mainland should lend Guishan, an island 5km south of Lantau, to Hong Kong to allow it to build artificial land there for 800,000 Hong Kongers. But Mrs Lam says the idea would not go down well in Beijing, given President Xi Jinping's green proclivities. She has not explained why he does not object to the Lantau scheme on such grounds.
In September more than 40% of those surveyed by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute opposed the project. Many would prefer the building of more housing near the mainland border on old industrial sites. But pro-government politicians in that semi-rural area object. Sadly for Mrs Lam, they have an outsize voice on the 1,200-member committee that picks the winning candidate for her job. Should she decide to seek re-election in 2022 she will need all the votes she can get."

China bullies other countries because it works. Once told that they have crossed a ""red line"" by harming China's interests or calling out its misdeeds, many governments crumble swiftly. Others fold after suffering months of threats, trade boycotts and cancelled official meetings. But in China's long experience, almost all-even sometimes America-climb down eventually, sending envoys to sue for peace. True, some Western leaders pay public lipservice to their own country's values as they land in far-off Beijing. Once the press is shooed from the room, however, the foreign visitors get down to dealmaking. They bow to China's mix of market power, geopolitical importance and ruthlessness.
Lately, bullying others into furtive submission has not been enough for Communist Party chiefs. Increasingly, they seem bent on humiliating countries that show defiance, notably small or mid-sized allies of America. Just now, it is Australia's turn for punishment. Its transgressions include taking a lead among American allies in banning the use of 5G network equipment from Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant, and calling for an independent probe into the origins of covid-19. China has imposed hefty tariffs on Australian wine and blocked imports of everything from coal to lobsters. In November Chinese diplomats made public a list of 14 ways in which Australia was ""poisoning bilateral relations"". The charge-sheet rebuked Australia for allowing news outlets, members of parliament and think-tanks to criticise China. Late last month China's foreign ministry pounced on an Australian government report into unlawful, brutal killings of prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan by Australian troops. Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman and licensed provocateur on social media, said the report exposed the hypocrisy of Western concerns about human rights. On November 30th Mr Zhao tweeted a crude photomontage made to look like an Australian soldier slitting an Afghan child's throat. Mr Zhao demanded that troops be held accountable-serenely ignoring the fact that Australia's inquiry had already recommended that 19 soldiers face criminal investigation.
At first sight, such Chinese provocations look clumsy, indeed self-defeating. By offending lots of ordinary Australians, they complicate life for those businesspeople and politicians who want their government to placate China in hopes of restoring normal, profitable trade flows. That underestimates the calculating nature of Mr Zhao's tweets and other Chinese attacks, which are not intended to win over Australian hearts and minds. Their aim is partly domestic: to demonstrate the foreign ministry's fighting spirit to Chinese leaders and online nationalists. The intention is also to demonstrate China's strength and to provoke such a sense of crisis that Australian political and business leaders are desperate to seek a truce. China's outlandish attacks are pseudo-populism: a calculated ploy to press elites into cutting a deal.
China may yet feel vindicated in its choice of tactics. Australia may cave. If it does not, and China decides to sacrifice relations with Australia for years to come, a ghastly warning will be sent to other trade partners that imagine they can criticise China with impunity. The world is a rough place on the eve of 2021. China feels in better shape than most. While other large economies remain battered by covid-19, it has already returned to growth. When enunciating their core national interests, Chinese leaders are at least predictable. In contrast, America's allies have spent four years absorbing hard lessons about the impermanence of American interests that once seemed carved in stone-lessons that will outlive the Trump presidency.
Yet conversations in recent weeks with more than a dozen ambassadors in Beijing reveal a striking change of mood. Westerners know that they often struggle to understand the incentives that guide Chinese officials. But envoys in Beijing increasingly suspect that China's rulers are misreading the mood in democracies. In particular, Communist Party bosses are too disdainful of Western public opinion, which is swinging against China in ways that will constrain governments, at least somewhat, as they strive to balance economic interests and democratic values.
China prefers to be admired, but will settle for fear
Western unity is too fragile to enable many formal displays of solidarity with Australia. And multinational corporations are not about to leave China. For lots of big firms, their only profitable business unit this year is Chinese. But China's assertiveness abroad, and its hardline ideological turn at home, are creating political uncertainties that businesses cannot ignore. The talk is of hedging now, and of diversifying future investments. There will be no binary moment when the West switches from engagement to decoupling. However, China is teaching the West to be more defensive. Over time, more individual, seemingly unconnected decisions will be a no, not a yes: whether to allow this Chinese investment, buy that sensitive technology from a Chinese firm, or sign an exchange deal with a Chinese university. That could have surprising cumulative effects. Western defensiveness will not stop China from rising, but it could alter China's trajectory, perhaps steering it towards dominance of only part of the world: a technoauthoritarian sphere in tension with a more liberal bloc.
For decades, countries have tolerated Chinese bullying. For that, thank pragmatism, naivety and cynicism among politicians and business bosses, and broad indifference among publics. Now, however, China seems bent on changing countries that it deems hostile, so that governments, news outlets, universities and other institutions never defy China again. Some trade partners, especially in China's backyard, will feel bound to submit. Others may prove more stubborn. China is no longer just a foreign-policy puzzle. As its confidence swells, and its technological footprint grows, it is ready to challenge how Western societies work at home. Imposing that sort of humiliation comes with costs."

The pandemic may be encouraging people to live in larger groups
In march, when Britain went into lockdown for the first time, Andrew Davidson, a 69-year-old retiree who lives alone, was in the middle of renovating his house in the small town of Leamington Spa. The kitchen was a building site so he accepted an offer from his sister to move in with her and her husband in Birmingham for a couple of weeks. Before leaving he asked the builder to put in temporary kitchen surfaces so he could move back in if they couldn't stand living together. Mr Davidson ended up staying away for nine weeks. It was ""absolutely brilliant"", he says.
In the mornings he would go for a walk with his sister or brother-in-law, or they would do gardening. In the afternoons they retreated to their own spaces to work on their own hobbies: German lessons via Zoom, Spanish study, and textile printing. They ate dinner together, sharing cooking and all-important baking duties. ""Living together was a bit of a revelation,"" says Mr Davidson. ""I was quite sorry to move out."" He says after his experience he would consider moving in with other people on a permanent basis in the future.
As lockdowns have limited socialising beyond cohabitants or small groups known as ""pods"" or ""bubbles"", stories abound of people moving in with others to lessen isolation or share housework. In fact, the pandemic may merely have accelerated an existing trend. More and more, people in the rich world are once again choosing to live together.
In Britain households where couples share with at least one other adult were the fastest-growing type in the two decades to 2019. In Canada 6% of the population lived in multigenerational households by 2016, and it was the fastest-growing type of living. By the same year a fifth of Australia's 24.5m people were living with others from outside their immediate family, a 42% increase on 15 years earlier.
Such enthusiasm runs counter to Western notions of individual freedom and privacy. Fights with family or flatmates are the stuff of common lore. But it is single-family households that are the outlier in the broad sweep of human history. From hunter-gatherers to workhouses, people lived in big groups, often including non-relatives, pooling resources such as food and sharing tasks such as cooking and child care. It is only after industrialisation, when work moved outside the home, that people in the Western world started to live in nuclear families.
In much of the world living in bigger family groups never stopped. Almost two thirds of households are extended family ones in Senegal, for example. Extended families provide a safety net where the state does not, pooling cash to pay medical bills and letting jobless nephews eat from the communal pot. Even in the West, the perception that the two-adults-two-kids family is the norm is outdated. In America the share of households made up of married couples with children halved between 1970 and 2019. People are marrying less and later. Marriages are less likely than they were to last until death.
Yet the splitting of the nuclear family has taken its time to create an explosion of new household types. Instead, much of the West has seen a dramatic rise in single-person households. From France to Japan, they make up over a third of the total number. In Germany they account for 40% of the total, in Finland 41%. Communal living, at least beyond student halls, retirement villages or monasteries, is ""often seen negatively or as a cult"", says Irene Pereyra, a designer who is running a project on communal living with ikea, a Swedish furniture firm.
Indeed, that is the appeal to some people. David and Kim Gotterson, an Australian couple in their 60s who lived for many years in communes, said they were rebelling against the materialistic society of their post-war-generation parents. ""We wanted a pure, more natural way to live,"" says Mr Gotterson. Environmentalists note that sharing homes is friendlier on the environment than having separate ones. Since the 1970s some feminists have emphasised the benefits for women of living with other women.
Communal infiltration
Although some choose to share out of belief, recent interest in shared housing has been sparked in large part by economic pressure. In Britain, where NiMBYism makes it extremely difficult to build new homes, the average house costs more than eight times the average salary, up from four times in the mid-1990s. Homes are less affordable for single women, who earn less than men. The number of older divorcees who live alone has gone up. In the absence of new construction, this squeezes the supply for younger people, who are less wealthy. ""As more people lose their jobs [because of the pandemic] or have their pay or their hours cut, sharing a household with more people is a way to pay the bills,"" says Bella DePaulo of the University of California, Santa Barbara, the author of ""How We Live Now"".
Companies have jumped on this opportunity. The Collective, a British outfit, runs three co-living buildings, one in New York and two in London. Its ""members"", whose average tenancy is nine months, live in studio flats but share lounges, gyms and a roster of events from cocktail-mixing to running clubs. The firm has another 9,000 units in development.
Although urban buildings run by the likes of The Collective are aimed mainly at young, single professionals, the types of people seeking to live this way are growing more diverse. The Collective houses people aged 18 to 67 years old (the average is 30). A survey by Build Asset Management, a British firm that runs serviced accommodation, said that in the year to June 2020 it saw a 136% rise in inquiries about shared rental accommodation from couples. Kin, an American company, last year opened two buildings in New York designed for families rather than singles or couples. Would-be residents can choose an apartment with up to four bedrooms and access to communal facilities and services, including a play area and nannies.
The most experimental housing today involves multiple generations of unrelated people who did not get a say on whom they lived with. Perhaps unsurprisingly it is found in Scandinavia. Some 60% of the residents of the 51apartments in Sällbo, a public-housing project in the Swedish town of Helsingborg, are over 70. The other 40% are young people, half of them refugees. Residents must pass an interview to get into the community, and sign a contract to spend two hours per week socialising with neighbours. This could mean sitting in a shared lounge reading a book or doing shopping for one of the older members. The project is to run for two years. If it is judged successful, tenants will be given permanent homes.
Crossing multigenerational boundaries has social benefits, says Dragana Curovic, the manager. The young, especially the newcomers, learn from the older people, who in turn appreciate the young people's help with practical things, she says. Isolation is unhealthy. One metastudy reported that people without strong social connections have a 50% higher chance of dying early-equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. A Swedish study of people over 75 years old found those with a variety of happy connections with friends and family had a lower risk of dementia.
Many other aspects of life can benefit from communal housing, too. Parents of small children find it easier to go out to work if they can leave their offspring at home with other friendly adults. Chloe and Alex Wolff, a couple in their 30s, and their baby son moved in with Alex's parents for seven months from March to September. Ms Wolff says she would not have been able to go back to work six months after giving birth, had she not been living with her inlaws. At that point all the nearby nurseries were shut because of covid-19.
Ben Brock-Johnson, a 40-year-old journalist, moved from New York to live in Pioneer Valley, a community of 32 homes in rural Massachusetts, with his wife and their now five-year-old twins. The community has shared gardens, as well as a large communal dining area and an events space. He says it is ""like having 100 parents for your kids"". There are people aroundincluding his parents, who live on the same estate-who can play with them, baby-sit them and just generally look out for them. His family, he reckons, have a much better work-life balance for it.
The disadvantages of sharing can be mitigated by design. Grace Kim, a Seattlebased architect who lives with eight other families in a building designed by her and her husband, says her development balances community and privacy-most people's concern about living communally. ""You can see into some people's kitchens but not their living rooms,"" she says.
Decision-making can be slow. You have to work with neighbours even if you do not like them. You cannot simply ignore them. However, as in the workplace, people who have to get things done together often put aside their differences and get on with the job. Communal living might, conceivably, help bring divided societies together, at least a little.
Fallout shelter
Few governments promote it, though. Landlords in Britain need a special licence to let single homes to multiple families. In New York individually rented apartments with shared bathrooms are banned (to discourage brothels). During the pandemic governments have warned of the dangers of big households: sociable youngsters may bring the virus home to their grandparents. Multigenerational living may partly explain why ethnic minorities have been so hard-hit by covid-19 in Britain.
Proponents of communal living say it has made lockdowns more bearable. Ms Kim's community stopped having 40-person communal meals. Instead, it set up pods of two to three families who could dine in well-ventilated shared spaces. In Sällbo, younger residents have gone out to shop for older ones who are shielding, says Ms Curovic. Lisa Feardon, a doctor who worked long, arduous shifts, says returning to her home at The Collective in London was ""a lifesaver"". In a normal rented flat she would have ""just come home and collapsed doing nothing,"" she says. ""But as everything is under one roof here I was able to still have some sort of work-life balance.""
Mr Davidson, whose house is now renovated, says while the pandemic continues he will be staying at his sister's a couple of nights each week (in a support bubble). The pandemic has forced people apart. But for an increasing number, communal living offers a way to stay connected. *"

NEW YORK
The pandemic is ushering in the next trillion-dollar industry
LAST JANUARY Stephen Klasko, chief executive of Jefferson Health, which runs hospitals in Philadelphia, chatted to a bank boss. The financier told him that 20 years ago health care and banking were the only industries yet to embrace the consumer and digital revolutions. ""Now"", Mr Klasko recalls him adding, ""you are alone.""
The banker had a point. The McKinsey Global Institute, the in-house think-tank of the eponymous consultancy, reckons that when it comes to digitisation, health care has indeed lagged behind not just banking but travel, retail, carmaking and even packaged goods. Some 70% of American hospitals still fax and post patient records. The ceo of a big hospital in Madrid reports virtually no electronic record-sharing across Spain's regions when the first wave of covid-19 washed over the country this spring.
By exposing such digital deficiencies, the pandemic is at last spurring change. Confronted with shutdowns and chaos, doctors have embraced digital communication and analytics that have been common in other industries for years. Patients are growing more comfortable with remote and computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment. And enterprising firms, from health-app startups and hospitals to insurers, pharmacies and tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Google, are scrambling to provide such services.
McKinsey estimates that global digitalhealth revenues-from telemedicine, online pharmacies, wearable devices and so on-will rise from $35obn last year to $6oobn in 2024 (see chart 1). Swathes of America's $3.6trn health-care market are in for a digital makeover. The same is happening in China, Europe and most other places where doctors ply their trade.
The groundwork for what looks poised to be the next trillion-dollar business has been accelerated by the pandemic. Money is pouring in. According to cb Insights, a research firm, a record $8.4bn of equity funding flowed into privately held digitalhealth darlings in the third quarter of 2020, more than double the amount a year ago (see chart 2 on next page). The industry's unlisted ""unicorns"", worth $1bn or more apiece, have a combined value of over $ii0bn, according to HoloniQ, a research firm. In September AmWell, a telemedic in which Google has invested $100m, raised $742m in an initial public offering (ipo); its market capitalisation is $6bn. On December 2nd JD Health, a digital pharmacy affiliated with jD.com, a Chinese online emporium, raked in $3.5bn in Hong Kong's second-biggest ipo this year.
No wonder investors are giddy. Demand for digital medicine is surging. Doctolib, a French firm, says its video consultations in Europe have shot up this year from 1,000 to 100,000 a day. Ping An Good Doctor, a Chinese online health portal viewed by some as the choicest part of its insurer parent (see Finance section), is expanding to South-East Asia in a joint venture with Grab, a Singaporean ride-hailing giant.
As with many technology fads, some of this will turn out to be hype. Sober analysts at Gartner, a research firm, pour cold water on exaggerated claims made by proponents of individualised ""precision medicine"" and medical artificial intelligence (ai). But even they admit there are reasons to think that not all the excitement is overblown.
Technologies such as sensors, cloud-computing and data analytics are becoming medical-grade just as the risk of contracting covid-19 in hospitals and clinics makes their adoption look more enticing than ever. Specialist firms like Livongo and Onduo make devices to monitor diabetes and other ailments continuously. A study by Stanford University found that nearly half of American doctors surveyed used such devices. Of that group, 71% regarded the data as medically useful. In June the Mayo Clinic, a prestigious non-profit hospital group, teamed up with a startup called Medically Home to provide ""hospital-level care"", from infusions and imaging to rehabilitation, in patients' bedrooms. Even the Apple Watch has been shown to predict a medical problem known as atrial fibrillation in a clinical trial.
An Apple a day
Patients are keen. A study of some 16m American ones just reported in jama Internal Medicine, a journal, found that their use of telemedicine surged 30-fold between January and June. American consumers surveyed in May by Gartner were increasingly using internet and mobile apps for a variety of medical needs (see chart 3).
Critically, regulators around the world are pressing health-care providers to open up their siloed systems-a precondition for digital health to flourish. The eu is promoting an electronic standard for medical records. In August the Indian government unveiled a plan for a digital health identity with interoperability at its core. Kuantai Yeh of Qiming, a vc firm, says that China's government, too, is trying to overcome resistance to electronic records from hospitals fearful of losing patients to rivals. Yidu Cloud, a big-data platform for hospitals, may already be the world's largest health data set, thinks Lee Kai-fu of Sinovation Ventures, another vc firm.
Apple, with its reputation for protecting users' privacy, is also championing a common standard. A combination of such efforts and regulatory pressure heralds ""a new era"" for digital medicine, thinks Aneesh Chopra, a former White House technology chief. Judy Faulkner, boss of Epic, a leading maker of software to manage electronic health records that Mr Chopra has long urged to be more open, declares she is all for it; 40% of the data managed by her firm are already shared with non-customers, she says. Kris Joshi, who runs Change, which handles over $i.5trn in American medical-insurance claims a year, sees more interoperability, at least between businesses.
All this is helping medicine evolve from ""a clinical science supported by data to a data science supported by clinicians"", argues Pamela Spence of ey, a consultancy. Does this make health care big tech's for the taking? Amazon wants Alexa, its digital assistant, to be able (with your permission) to analyse your cough and tell you if it is croupy or covidy. In November the online giant, which already sells just about everything else, launched a digital pharmacy to take on America's drug-distribution coterie of pharma firms, middlemen and retailers. AliHealth, a division of Alibaba, China's e-commerce champion, is disrupting its home pharmacy market. Its revenues leapt by 74% in the six months to September, year on year, to $1.1bn. Apple has its watch and nearly 50,000 iPhone health apps. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has Verily, a life-sciences division.
Tech giants' earlier forays into health care flopped, argues Shubham Singhal of McKinsey, because they had gone it alone. Medicine is a regulatory minefield with powerful incumbents where big tech's business models, particularly the ad-supported sort, are not a natural fit. But the pandemic has also highlighted that existing providers' snazzy hardware and pricey services too seldom genuinely improve health outcomes. If the new generation of digital technologies is to thrive it must ""improve health, not increase costs"", thinks Vivian Lee of Verily. Her firm is moving away from fee-for-service to risk-based contracts that pay out when outcomes improve (eg, if diabetics get blood sugar under control or more people get eye exams).
That points to a hybrid future where Silicon Valley works more closely with traditional health-care firms. Epic is using voice-recognition software from Nuance, a startup, to enable doctors to send notes to outside specialists; it has also teamed up with Lyft, a ride-hailing firm, to ferry patients to hospitals. Siemens Healthineers, a big German health-tech firm, is working with Geisinger, an American hospital chain, to expand remote patient monitoring. Patients of India's Apollo Hospitals can use an app to get drug refills, tele-consultations and remote diagnoses-and even secure a medical loan through Apollo's partnership with hdfc Bank.
Dr Klasko, keen to prove the banker wrong, is embracing the hybrid approach with gusto. ""You must have partnerships with providers, not just hundreds of unconnected apps."" He has brought bright sparks from General Catalyst, a vc firm that made early bets on many digital-health startups including Livongo, to work alongside his innovation team in Philadelphia. ""Moving fast and breaking things does not work well in health care,"" observes Hemant Taneja of General Catalyst. But nor does standing still."

The surprising resilience of American restaurant chains
Covid-19 has been brutal for big tenants of American shopping centres, such as clothing stores and cinemas. Not so for the casual eateries that surround these outlets. Many of America's sit-down dining chains are on track to emerge stronger after two quarters of pandemic-driven innovation. The final hurdle is the winter.
Independent restaurants were early victims of lockdowns. Chewing, chatter and low air-flow made their busy floors prime candidates for super-spreader events. As early as March, state and local regulations shut down dining halls and began to whittle down the ranks of sit-down eateries. Yelp, a popular review website, reported more than 32,000 restaurant closures between March and September; 61% of these were predicted to be permanent.
Larger chains fared better. With the credit lines and corporate infrastructure to roll out new delivery methods and safety measures, they steadily stemmed losses. Plenty have now recovered or exceeded their pre-pandemic valuations.
New off-premises business has helped. Texas Roadhouse, a steakhouse chain, introduced to-go ""family packs"" and an online butcher selling meat to grill at home. This tided it over as it installed protective equipment and slowly reopened dining rooms. In October it reported a year-onyear increase in same-store sales.
Other chains dealt with a fall-off in diners by propping up profit margins. Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, slashed promotional spending and simplified menus to reduce waste and costs. Olive Garden's margins improved even as a lack of clients in flagship locations depressed overall sales. The company felt sufficiently self-assured after the second quarter to reinstate its dividend.
America's restaurant chains are outperforming international rivals, says Dennis Geiger of ubs, a bank. American consumers have steadily returned to fill seats as officials lift restrictions (see chart). In other markets stricter regulations and shyer consumers are holding back recovery. Hong Kong's dining sector has yet to turn around from its spring collapse; receipts fell to an all-time low in the third quarter and even fast-food purchases fell by 23% relative to last year. The share price of Vapiano, a big German chain, stands at less than a tenth of its pre-pandemic level. Darden's is back to where it was in January. Texas Roadhouse's is up by a third.
Winter will test the strength of American chains once more, as lockdowns loom to staunch the flood of new covid cases. At least chains with a national presence think that even as northern locations grow frosty, southern states will be opening patios. And data from Yelp show that interest in outdoor dining is breaking records: it was up tenfold in early October, year on year. *"

BERLIN
Herbert Diess takes on the unions over the Volkswagen system
Five years ago the Porsche and Piěch families, who control just over half of Volkswagen's voting rights, poached Herbert Diess from bmw, a posh Bavarian carmaker. He was hired to run vw, the biggest by far of the the group's 12 marques, because of his reputation as a cost-cutter and hard-nosed manager who would not shy away from taking on the unions. Untainted by vw's ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal, he made a good start by improving its poor profit margins. In 2018 he was rewarded with the job of running the entire group.
Only two years later the dynamic Bavarian's job is on the line after a series of clashes with organised labour. In June Mr Diess almost got the boot because of a dust-up with the supervisory board over a leak of confidential information about the group's software failings. He alleged it might have come from the board's union representatives. After that he was relieved of his job as boss of vw (which he had kept).
This time the clash is more serious still. On December 1st the executive committee of the group's 20-member supervisory board, the non-executive conclave that holds management to account, met to discuss his request for an extension of his contract. The current one runs to 2023, so extending it now would constitute a vote of confidence. No decision has been made public. The whole board will convene on December 10th.
Mr Diess demands unequivocal backing from the board so that he can fulfil his mission to cut vw's bloated workforce and boost profitability (which is lagging far behind Audi and Porsche, the stars of the group). He wants to fill the soon-to-be-vacant job of chief financial officer with an ally, perhaps Arno Antlitz, Audi's finance chief. He also intends to make his confidant the group's head of procurement. The two roles are central to his drive to boost efficiency at vw, which recently approved a €15obn ($181bn) investment plan.
Bernd Osterloh, who heads the works council and also sits on the supervisory board's executive committee, voted down Mr Antlitz and other candidates for the two jobs suggested by Mr Diess. That provoked Mr Diess to ask the board for support. Stefan Weil is the state premier of Lower Saxony, which, as the owner of 20% of vw shares, is entitled to two seats on the supervisory board. The Volkswagen law from 1960, which limits the voting rights of any shareholder to 20%, gives Lower Saxony a veto on any major decision. To protect investment and jobs in the region, representatives of the Land invariably back the board's ten labour representatives, which means that organised labour tends to call the shots on vw's board.
""Osterloh and Weil will try to bring down Diess,"" predicts Ferdinand Dudenhöffer of the Centre for Automotive Research, a think-tank. Mr Diess, who can be gruff, clashed with Mr Osterloh soon after he arrived from BMW-and regularly since then. On November 28th he published a manifesto on how to transform vw into a digital company focused on electric vehicles. ""When I started in Wolfsburg, I was determined to change the Volkswagen system,"" he wrote of his early days at vw's headquarters. Mr Diess wanted to ""break down antiquated structures, and make the company more agile and modern"". He succeeded in some areas, he said, but not everywhere.
""Lower Saxony should give up its voting rights,"" thinks Mr Dudenhöffer. Otherwise vw will remain constrained by its ""provincial corset"". Mr Dudenhöffer believes that Dieselgate would not have happened without vw's skewed corporate governance. With unions refusing to allow lay-offs, he explains, cheating may have seemed the only way to increase its profit margins. Toyota sells almost the same number of cars worldwide as vw with roughly twofifths of the workforce.
Bernstein, a research firm, published an open letter to board members in November urging them either to back Mr Diess or to sack him. Corporate Germany's traditional model of co-determination has gone too far at vw, the letter says. It is supposed to help bosses and labour to work together rather than fight each other at every turn. Even if the board backs Mr Diess this time, the infighting will soon resume. It may be time to consider repealing the counterproductive Volkswagen law."

US Congress v China Inc
For 18 years American regulators have implored Beijing to let them inspect the China-based auditors of Chinese companies listed on America's stock exchanges. Dream on, China's Communist regime responded, citing sovereignty and national security. On December 2nd Congress had had enough. The House of Representatives passed a bill that would boot offending firms off American bourses if their auditors fail to comply with regulators' information requests for three years running. Since it had earlier sailed through the Senate by 100 votes to nil, it can expect a presidential signature.
This would put Chinese businesses worth a combined $2trn at eventual risk of expulsion, including Alibaba, a New York-listed internet titan (see chart). It would make it harder for Americans to get exposure to China through American exchanges. Those hungry for juicy Chinese stocks might end up buying them abroad instead, through channels over which Washington exerts no control."

BEIJING
Two hotel groups thrive amid their industry's pandemic malaise
Covid-19 has, received wisdom has it, been terrible for hotels. The share prices of the eight biggest listed Western groups by room count have slipped by 14%, on average, this year. The glum consensus is, though, being challenged by two big Chinese chains. Both are enjoying resurgent demand for domestic travel as China has tamed its epidemic. And strength at home is fuelling ambitions abroad.
Jin Jiang, the world's second-biggest hotel firm by capacity, boasted an occupancy rate of 74% in the third quarter, in line with last year and more than double that of its bigger rival, Marriott International. Its market value has soared by three-quarters this year, to $6.4bn, above better-known Asian brands such as Shangri-La and Mandarin Oriental. Huazhu, which like Jin Jiang is based in Shanghai, saw revenue per available room recover by 40% from the second quarter, to 179 yuan ($27). The group is now worth $16bn, behind only Marriott and Hilton Worldwide among the world's listed hoteliers.
Similarly to their big Western rivals, Jin Jiang and Huazhu each owns a portfolio of brands that cater to different customers. Jin Jiang, which is controlled by Shanghai's local government, operates everything from budget digs (think Marriott's Fairfield Inn) to the upper end of the mass market (like Sheraton). Huazhu is a more allencompassing group, which also competes in the luxury segment. Both companies prefer to offload the costs of hotel construction to franchisees in exchange for lower franchise fees, which enables them to expand much more rapidly.
The pair indeed look poised to capture a greater market share at home, reckons Yulin Zhong of 86Research. In America chain hotels accounted for 72% of all hotel rooms at the end of 2019. In China the equivalent figure was just 27%.
As incomes rise and Chinese travellers become more discerning, the standardised, dependable amenities and good service that big chains guarantee begin to look more appealing. Domestic providers of such things enjoy a substantial first-mover advantage. The number of hotel rooms in China held by Wyndham, the biggest foreign operator, is merely a third that of Huazhu and a fifth that of Jin Jiang. And their advantage is growing-the two firms have more than 7,300 hotels under development between them, mostly in China, equivalent to 47% of their existing stock.
In a bid to break into the global market, two years ago Jin Jiang purchased a majority stake in Radisson, the world's 11th-biggest hotel operator by capacity, for $332m. In January Huazhu paid $868m for Deutsche Hospitality, a posh German group. Such tie-ups allow the new owners to study the nuances of serving a sophisticated foreign clientele without spending millions on marketing their unfamiliar brands in the West (or raising the sort of hackles that Chinese acquisitions often do in more sensitive industries such as technology or finance). As American and European hoteliers continue to reel amid the pandemic's second wave, more last-minute deals may be on offer for the Shanghai duo. *"

The boss of Salesforce has his sights set on tech's big league
Marc benioff got the idea for the ""ohana"" corporate culture on a sabbatical in Hawaii. The term refers to a network of families bound together. He likes to think of Salesforce, the world's thirdbiggest software firm, which he founded and runs, as just such a network. On December 1st Mr Benioff welcomed Slack, an instant-messaging tool, to his ohana. The $27.7bn deal is one of the biggest ever in the software industry.
Like many family alliances the tie-up is partly about power and feuds. Slack's product has a cultlike following, which Salesforce wants to harness to build a tech platform that sells digital tools that no firm can do without. Stewart Butterfield, Slack's cofounder, hailed it (hyperbolically) as ""the most strategic combination in the history of software"". The feud is with Microsoft, whose advances Slack spurned four years ago. The deal makes Salesforce a far more formidable challenger to the giant.
Mr Benioff may be best known to the public for championing corporate ""purpose"" (and owning Time magazine). But in his own industry he wins kudos for disruptive innovation. In the 2000s the young Salesforce basically invented software-asa-service (saas)-accessing programs remotely rather than installing them on office computers-particularly for managing customer relationships. Microsoft, Oracle, sap and others had to follow suit.
The explosive growth of saas has propelled Salesforce to ever greater heights. And to greater breadth: since 2016 it has spent over $25bn snapping up over a dozen firms to boost its computing chops. It bought Tableau, a data-analytics platform, and MuleSoft, which helps firms connect legacy it systems to the cloud.
Then came the pandemic. A boom in tech stocks lifted Salesforce's market value from $144bn to $225bn this year. Slack, whose share price has lagged behind those of Zoom and other enablers of remote work, suddenly looked affordable. Mr Benioff is paying with a mix of cash and Salesforce stock. His firm's valuation is still well behind Microsoft's $1.6trn. But it may at last have a shot at tech's top table. It already rules in customer-relationship software and thrives in other areas of business software, especially since acquiring Tableau. Aaron Levie, boss of Box, a cloud firm, describes Slack as ""another dot on the graph"" that plots Salesforce's rise to become the world's number-two business-software company (behind Microsoft). Perhaps, Mr Levie muses, ""even the largest"".
Such sentiments explain why for Microsoft the Slack deal is a red rag. Slack got the giant's attention a few years ago when Mr Butterfield promised to wipe out email, which would threaten Outlook, Microsoft's popular inbox, and its email server, Exchange. ""If you are going to come at the king, you'd better not miss,"" quips Charles Fitzgerald, a former executive at Microsoft who is now an angel investor. Back then Mr Butterfield did miss-and Microsoft shot back with a new product, Teams, combining messaging with videoconferencing and other functions. Slack has launched an antitrust complaint against it for offering Teams free of charge in its Office bundle, together with its popular word processor and Excel spreadsheets.
Teams is a big reason why Mr Butterfield is in an ohana-ish mood. Like Zoom, it has videoconferencing-and far more active users than Slack, which explains the latter's lacklustre stockmarket performance. Salesforce will invest to reinvigorate it, presumably adding more video-meeting capability. Its sales machine will push Slack beyond early adopters into the corporate mainstream.
That will intensify Salesforce's rivalry with Microsoft, with which it will compete in three main areas. With Slack it will directly take on Office, now that Teams has been folded into it. Slack also offers a gateway to 2,400 software tools, mostly created by independent companies, that compete with other Microsoft products. Salesforce and Slack could bundle all this software into a convenient alternative to Microsoft. Second, Salesforce competes with the giant in customer-relationship management, where it plans to make Slack the user interface, and other business functions.
Then there is the bigger battle over platforms. Both Salesforce and Microsoft aim to give businesspeople who do not themselves write software the tools to build customised programs-""with clicks not code"", as Salesforce puts it. Salesforce's Developer 360 is punier than Microsoft's Power Platform but is improving, thanks to MuleSoft and Einstein, a set of artificial-intelligence services. Slack could be a ""Trojan horse"" to hook customers of Salesforce's own clients on more of the company's applications, says George Gilbert of TechAlpha Partners, a consultancy.
Success is not in the bag for Salesforce. Mr Benioff may fail to turn his vision into reality. Even if Slack gets its video act together it would be late to videoconferencing, which has matured rapidly during the pandemic. Most large corporate clients already use Zoom, Teams or Cisco's Webex software. And Salesforce might mistakenly end up sacrificing Slack's growth while trying to bolster its own businesses.
Moreover, Slack is not in and of itself enough to make Salesforce into a genuine rival to Microsoft. Mr Benioff would need to build (or buy) capabilities in document storage, cyber-security and more, reckons Mark Moerdler of Bernstein, a broker.
Wall Street is already wary of Salesforce's big acquisitions; the firm's share price dipped when news of the Slack deal surfaced. Still, saas holds vast potential, as Microsoft shareholders know well. And, as Mr Butterfield noted on the deal's announcement, Mr Benioff has already started one revolution. Betting against this ohana is not for the faint-hearted. *"

PARIS
Multinationals based in Switzerland narrowly avoid new ethics standards
Corporate chieftains can barely keep tabs on what their own staff are up to, let alone suppliers and subsidiaries in farflung places. A referendum in Switzerland on November 29th proposed to change that, making Swiss multinationals liable in domestic courts for lapses in human rights or environmental stewardship along their global supply chains. The proposal failed by the narrowest of margins-a watereddown version will come into force instead.
The changes were championed by the usual foes of big business-ngos, pressure groups and the like-with their longstanding gripes over cacao that Nestlé uses in KitKats or cobalt traded by Glencore. This political push to make companies more accountable chimes with boardroom proclamations about purpose-driven business, shareholders be damned. Corporate bosses nonetheless fiercely opposed the measures. Vague threats were made about footloose multinationals moving to laxer jurisdictions.
That won't be necessary. Though the Responsible Business Initiative gained 50.7% of votes, it failed to carry enough cantons under the arcane Swiss system. (Another proposal, to ban the central bank from investing in defence companies, was roundly defeated.) The Swiss government, which opposed the measures, will still bring in some less stringent norms. Reporting standards will be tightened, with fines for erring. But campaigners will not be allowed to bring wayward companies to civil courts, as they had hoped.
No Swiss business is-at least publicly-in favour of child labour, human-rights abuses or environmental vandalism. But low taxes, pleasant living conditions and a historical penchant for business-friendly policies like bank secrecy have helped the Alpine confederation attract more than its fair share of global firms, some with tricky supply chains. All proclaim their attachment to corporate social responsibility, as proven by glossy brochures. But none felt being dragged through Swiss courts for misbehaviour elsewhere would do anything but enrich lawyers. Some argued that the risk of litigation may dissuade them from being open about inevitable shortcomings they are working to fix.
The referendum was seen as a prequel to wider European efforts to hold businesses accountable beyond their immediate operations. Germany has mulled a law on supply-chain standards; next year the eu will push for firms to be held responsible for human-rights abuses and environmental harm. If the Swiss experience is anything to go by, bosses will resist, stakeholder-friendly rhetoric notwithstanding."

Businesses are still struggling to understand which of the pandemic's effects will be temporary and which will turn out to be permanent. Three new reports attempt to analyse these longerterm trends. One is from Glassdoor, a website that allows workers to rank their employers. Another is from the Boston Consulting Group (bcg), a management consultancy. The third is from the Chartered Management Institute (cmi), a British professional body. Read together, they imply that firms stand to benefit- but that managers' lives are about to get more difficult.
One change that is all but certain to last is employees spending more of their time working at home. The Glassdoor report finds that less commuting has improved employee health and morale. Splitting the week between the home and the office is also overwhelmingly popular with workers: 70% of those surveyed wanted such a combination, 26% wanted to stay at home and just 4% desired a full-time return to the office. Perhaps as a consequence, remote work has not dented productivity-and indeed improved it in some areas. Flexible work schedules can be a cheap way to retain employees who have child-care and other home responsibilities.
Telecommuting offers other potential cost savings, and not just the reduced need for office space. Remote workers do not need to live in big cities where property is expensive. If they live in cheaper towns and suburbs, companies need not pay them as much. Glassdoor estimates that software engineers and developers who leave San Francisco could eventually face salary cuts of 21-25%; those quitting New York could expect reductions of 10-12%. As the report points out, remote employees are, in essence, competing with a global workforce and are thus in a much weaker bargaining position.
This point is reinforced by the bcg report, which finds that the pandemic has increased the willingness of companies to work with freelancers. Previously, many managers worried that legal and compliance issues prevented them from using outside staff. The pandemic forced firms to adjust their business models rapidly, and simultaneously led to growth in the pool of talented freelancers, as full-time employees had to be laid off. bcg says that ""by embracing flexibility in whom they hire, internally or externally, [companies] can finally speed up operations and deliver faster on strategy.""
Despite its advantages, a remote workforce, or one consisting of more outsiders, brings challenges for managers, as the third report demonstrates. The cmi surveyed 2,300 managers and employees. The results highlight just how important effective communication, and concern for workers' well-being, is to good management. They also unearthed an interesting difference of perspective: nearly half of senior executives thought they were engaging employees more in decisionmaking since the pandemic, but only 27% of employees agreed.
The survey also shows that the experience of remote working has not been uniform. Of those working virtually, 69% of women with children want to work at least one day from home when the pandemic ends, compared with 56% of men with kids. These women have had less contact with managers during the lockdown than their male peers have had, suggesting they have been neglected.
Strikingly, 48% of British staff from minority ethnic backgrounds thought that workplace culture had got better during the crisis, against 34% of all employees. This suggests something was wrong with office culture beforehand: the cmi survey found that black employees were more likely than any other ethnic group to feel their manager did not trust them to undertake their role.
So managers have a lot more work to do in responding to the pandemic. Executives need to tailor their behaviour to individual employees' needs. Ironically, though managers may have feared that remote working would allow employees to slack, it may be that managers have not been up to the challenge. Bosses may have spent too much time videoconferencing and not enough speaking directly with subordinates.
Ask someone what it is like to work at a firm and they may respond by saying what the offices are like-whether they are cramped, in a nice location and so on. In a world of remote working, employees may stress instead how the employer communicates with them. Not so much ""management by walking around"" as management by phoning-or Zooming- around. Time to get dialling."

Switzerland is known for its timepieces. But it is also home to another business that for most of its history has operated with metronomic regularity. That is Nestlé, the world's biggest food company. Established in the 1860s in Vevey, a small town on the shores of Lake Geneva that remains its home to this day, it has long been seen as an opaque behemoth with an insular culture and the occasional brush with scandal. Yet a billion of its products are consumed every day. Its sales last year surpassed $93bn. When it talks coffee, it talks in 100bn cupfulls. Data may be the new oil in America and Asia, but in Europe hot beverages are hotter than either crude or computing. With a market value of $320bn, Nestlé is worth more than Royal Dutch Shell, the continent's biggest energy firm, and sap, its software giant.
Many global food firms have been models of reliability. Other venerable names, such as Campbell's, Danone, Kraft Heinz and Unilever (which sells more non-food items than food), also have roots stretching back over a century. Yet five years ago, amid a sharp slowdown in growth, the industry suddenly found itself under siege. за, a Brazilian private-equity group with a zeal for ruthless cost-cutting, merged H.J. Heinz and Kraft Foods. Two years later American activists targeted Nestlé, demanding the same recipe. The same year Kraft Heinz tried and failed to take over Unilever, and later saw its profits tumble, leaving 3G's reputation in tatters.
Europe's consumer-goods business is still growing at about half the pace it did a decade ago. It badly needs a caffeine shot. No one has shown better how to administer one than Mark Schneider, Nestlé's first chief executive from outside the firm in almost a century-and the barista-in-chief of its three-year turnaround.
Mr Schneider, a straight-talking German with an American passport and a fondness for quips, is the perfect foil for bossy hedge funds. He is not prone to panic. But nor is he complacent. He came from outside the food industry, so sees it with fresh eyes. He carried out what Martin Deboo of Jefferies, a bank, calls ""the chiefexecutive version of Blairism"", steering a middle course between the aggressive profit-margin targets desired by the Americans and the meagre restructuring tolerable to the Swiss. Most significant, he revived confidence in organic sales growth, a metric that had fallen at Nestlé from an annual 7.5% in 20iito 2.4% the year he took over. During the slash-and-burn era of 3G, sales growth was for wimps. No longer-partly thanks to Mr Schneider.
The importance of sales growth is hard to overstate in food. Bernstein, a broker, calls it the ""lifeblood"" of the industry. In recent years it has been pummelled by changing diets, digitalisation and deflation in parts of the rich world, as well as sluggishness in emerging markets. But Mr Schneider swiftly found remedies.
The first was innovation. Thanks to e-commerce, small upstart brands were able to elbow aside the behemoths and sell directly to consumers. He responded by forcing boffins to bring Nestlé's ideas to market more quickly, often digitally. The three years it sometimes took them was fine for a car, but not for a chocolate bar, he says. New ideas he cherishes include allergy-busting cat foods and vegan burgers. Second, he was quick to strike transformative deals. Within six months of licensing Starbucks coffee in 2018, Nestlé had already launched 24 of the chain's products. Third, he bought and sold companies, adding to fast-growing nutritionalhealth businesses and selling down pedestrian ones such as ice cream in America and packaged meat in Europe.
Nestlé has sped up growth in other areas, too. It is moving relentlessly upmarket. Last year the share of sales from premium products rose to more than a quarter, including items with naked snob appeal such as ""flat white over ice"" Nespresso pods. It has joined the craze for plant-based foods and other healthy fare (never mind that this makes its confectionery business look increasingly out of place). And it is desperate to improve its reputation for sustainability. On December 3rd it said it would invest SFri.2bn ($i.3bn) over five years to help its farmers improve their soils as part of a SFr3.2bn effort to combat climate change. It has also pledged to make packaging recyclable or resuable by 2025. These are attempts to soften its image as a corporate goliath, which puts off not just young shoppers but snobby well-off ones, too.
For now, investors are impressed. As Mr Deboo notes, the share price has already awarded Nestlé ten out of ten for the turnaround, though that may be premature. Sales growth has still not recovered to the 4-6% a year that the firm once promised. Infant formula remains a laggard. So does water, with its cheapest bottled products, consumed in offices, battered by the pandemic. And Nestlé is not immune to industry-wide problems. Growth is slowing in emerging markets as people there spend less on ingestible treats and more on digital goods. Moreover, low incomes among the young will dampen their appetite for premium products.
Not so sweet
Relatively speaking, the virus has been kind to Nestlé. Most of its products are used at home, rather than on-the-go, so extra sales for the pantry easily eclipsed what was lost at the sweet shop. Danone, a European rival that was already struggling to keep up with Nestlé at the start of the year, has slipped much further behind.
Still, Mr Schneider is no blithe optimist. In a recent Zoom meeting held amid stockmarket euphoria about the prospects for a covid-19 vaccine, he was cautious. As a former health-care executive used to handling cold chains, he expressed doubts about the ability to distribute vaccines at the required temperatures, especially in the developing world. The longer it takes to spread the vaccine, the higher public debts will pile up, potentially casting a ""long shadow"" over the 2020s. On top of that, he notes, a demographic challenge is looming with rising numbers of elderly requiring medical care. ""I'm quite muted in my outlook,"" he admits. But Nestlé, in more than 150 years of history, has survived worse. *"

HONG KONG
The world's most valuable insurer has transformed itself into a fintech super-app. Could others follow its lead?
A job interview at Ping An is a strange experience. To become an agent at the insurance group, the world's largest by market capitalisation, candidates must take questions from an intelligent machine. As they respond, their voice, choice of words and gestures are scrutinised for the qualities of the most productive salespeople. After accruing data from millions of such interviews, the firm believes its artificial-intelligence (ai) system can quickly pluck talent and weed out the duds. Judged by the company's agent-productivity scores, it is working.
Just as the recruitment tool offers a glimpse into the future of hiring, Ping An itself may offer a window on to the future of finance. The tool is just one of thousands of applications built by the group's army of engineers. They support a sprawling array of services, from insurance and banking to health care and education, which this year alone have been used by close to 600m people. No other traditional financial-services group in the world comes close to rivalling Ping An's ability to develop technologies and deploy them at such a scale.
The firm, set up by Peter Ma, began life as a small unit at a state-owned enterprise in Shenzhen, selling bosses insurance against worker-compensation claims. It was eventually spun out in 1988. By the mid-2000s it had become one of China's largest life and property insurers, and attracted investment from hsbc, a bank. Today it is worth 1.5trn yuan ($236bn; see chart 1), and has redefined itself as a technology conglomerate built around an insurance business. It is now the largest investor in hsbc.
Three things distinguish Ping An's operating model from that of a standard insurer: its vast platform of services; its approach towards its hundreds of millions of users and customers; and, underpinning it all, its technological prowess. Take its array of subsidiaries first. The firm sells life and health insurance, which in the first three quarters of the year accounted for 67% of net profit. It provides health care through Good Doctor, its digital-medicine group (see Business section). Customers can park their cash with Ping An's bank or invest it through Lufax, its wealth-advisory arm (which listed in New York on October 30th). They can buy a car or sign up for education services, and then finance the payments through Ping An's consumer-credit unit.
The sheer breadth of services on offer allows Ping An to treat customers more as a social-media firm would, rather than an insurer-the second distinctive feature of its business model. Unusually for a financial institution, Ping An considers the majority of people buying its products to be users instead of customers. They may buy a health service from Good Doctor or a car from Autohome, its car-purchasing app, contributing to the company's data pool, yet remaining outside its core customer base. ""You don't have to jump through hoops. All you need to do is download our app,"" says Jessica Tan, one of the group's three co-chief executives. Only when they hold a financial product at one of the core units of the company, such as an insurance policy, do users become customers.
By allowing hundreds of millions of people to dip their toes in its product offering, Ping An has created a pool of users that can be targeted for sales of more sophisticated products. More than 578m people used its platform in the first nine months of the year (see chart 2). Some 214m were customers who had contractual agreements with the company. The rest were considered users. In the first half of the year, about 35% of its 18m new customers were sourced from its users. As the company has won over more users, that percentage has risen steadily in recent years.
Ping An is also becoming better at the lucrative business of ""cross-selling"", or selling customers more products from other parts of the group, which increases income without incurring the cost of acquiring new clients. The share of retail customers that have contracts with more than one subsidiary rose from around 19% in 2015 to about 37% in June. That puts Ping An about 20 percentage points above the average cross-selling rate for insurers in Asia, according to Bain, a consulting firm.
None of this would be possible without Ping An's technological prowess-the third and by far most important ingredient of its success. ai allows cross-selling pitches to customers to be made when they are most useful, for instance. ""The final sale is done by an agent but the system develops the recommendation,"" says Henrik Naujoks of Bain. ""And it's done at the right time.""
Large banks and insurers often sponsor ""fintech incubators"" that develop new technologies, or buy in applications that can be patched on to their core operations. hsbc, for instance, hired Identitii, an Australian fintech, this year to build a digitalpayments tool. But for regulatory reasons such experiments tend to be ring-fenced from the financial institution.
Ping An, by contrast, has fully internalised these operations, apparently unafraid of regulatory blowback. The group has a 110,000-strong technology development team-larger than the commercial-banking divisions of all but the biggest banks- including 3,000 scientists. It submitted 4,625 technology patents in the first half of the year alone. The tools developed within the group's technology unit are often used across the company. These include creditrisk models that use vast stores of data to make quick lending decisions at Ping An's consumer-finance division, Puhui. Similar data crunching can track a customer's driving habits through movements detected on a mobile-phone sensor and price car insurance accordingly. More accurate pricing on both fronts saves the company money.
When large financial firms do develop systems in-house, they jealously guard them from competitors. Mr Ma has turned that notion on its head by transforming Ping An's technology division into a sales unit and profit centre. When the company developed its own cloud-computing tech for hosting its banking and insurance systems, it eventually turned the technology into products that now serve 630 banks and 100 insurers across China-a ""software-asa-service"" model for banking that is often compared to what Amazon Web Services has done for website hosting.
Ping An's lending algorithms facilitated 474.bn yuan in loans at rival banks in the first half of the year. That unit, renamed OneConnect, went public last year. Another, called Smart City, builds and operates internal systems for hospitals. Local governments in 118 cities buy Ping An's administrative technology.
Its technology business, which includes the sale of cloud-computing services, generated just 4.5% of group net profits in the first nine months of 2020. But making the transition from financial institution to fintech means turning tech into a profit centre, says Leonard Li at Oliver Wyman, a consultancy. That tech turns a profit at all, rather than adding to its cost base, makes Ping An unusual.
Could elements of the model be adopted elsewhere? Many of the individual technologies developed by Ping An will soon be applied by western insurers; some are already talking about how to become ""the Ping An of Europe"". But wholesale fintech adoption will be harder in countries with stricter regulation on big data (and will probably become more difficult in China, too). Customers in America and Europe may also be more reluctant than those in China to buy insurance, health-care and wealth-management from one company.
Meanwhile, Ping An's approach is being put to the test. When covid-19 first struck in January the company was a year into restructuring its life-insurance business. That involves improving its force of over 1m agents, who are still the main channel for insurance sales in China. The country's insurers are not only battling among themselves for talent, they are also fighting off new entrants. ""We are competing with the tech companies too,"" says Jason Yao, another co-ceo. Companies with their own financial technologies, such as Ant Group, have launched rival insurance offerings.
The Ai-powered recruitment and training tool has been one of Ping An's top solutions. It appeared to be working in 2019, when the value of new business per agent in the company's life-insurance division rose by a healthy 16.4% compared with the previous year. The gauge fell by almost as much in the first half of 2020. Analysts say that rivals in China have fared even worse. But the risk, says one consultant, is that the effectiveness of some of Ping An's tech solutions may have been overestimated because of rapid growth in the insurance industry in China at the time. A prolonged downturn could show that some of its tech is less effective than first thought.
Another threat comes from leadership changes. In part, these reflect Ping An's position on the tech frontier, which has led rivals to sniff around its executives. Ericson Chan, chief executive of Ping An Technology, was poached in September by Zurich, another insurer. Lee Yuan Siong, Ping An Insurance's chief executive, took over as the boss of aia, a Hong Kong-based insurer, this year. The loss of the pair has been a blow to the group. More could follow.
Questions also hang around the future of Mr Ma, who is 65 this year. He stepped down as group chief executive in July, prompting industry watchers to expect him to retire soon. But he continues to call the shots as chairman, and there is no talk of succession planning yet. Were Mr Ma to depart, some worry that Ping An's rapid rise would come to a swift end. ""There's only one person driving innovation,"" says a consultant. For all its use of machines, Ping An is still subject to key-man risk. *"

NEW YORK
A crowd of data firms are cashing in on the quant-investing boom
Traders and their Bloomberg terminals are seldom parted. Some 330,000 people fork out around $25,000 annually to access Bloomberg's suite of services: financial-market data; graphing and pricing tools; the ability to chat with other market participants. These functions are so vital for bond traders, hedge-fund managers and pension-fund investors that, when the pandemic closed offices worldwide, many lugged their terminals home in taxi cabs.
As quantitative investing swells and algorithms dominate financial markets, though, the demand for data is changing. A human stock-picker might prefer a single slick platform through which they can build charts and chat to their broker, but quantitative firms want to be plugged into vast data sets that they can sift for signals. One of the quickest-growing slices of the market-data industry for the past five years has been direct selling to investment managers, rather than traders. And a motley, fragmented bunch of providers are having enormous success selling proprietary data directly to quantitative managers. A reminder of this came on November 30th when s&p, a rating agency and financialinformation firm, said it would buy ihs Markit, a credit-data provider, for $44bn. The tie-up is the second-largest acquisition announced this year, behind only a $56bn Chinese oil-pipeline deal in July.
The providers that are winning from the quant boom are doing so almost by historical accident. Some-such as Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange (ice), which run exchanges-were once merely financial-market plumbers, clearing transactions and matching trades. Other niche players, like ihs Markit, started off by providing pricing for the opaque market in credit-default swaps, hoping to tap investors' growing appetite for derivatives. The transaction data these firms accumulated used to be a by-product. Now they are ""the lifeblood of finance"", says Audrey Blater of Aite Group, a research firm. Market-data revenues have grown by around 5-8% per year for the past five years and margins are fat. s&p has an operating margin of 56%, 16 percentage points more than five years ago.
Now these once entirely disparate firms are teaming up. The s&p and ihs Markit merger follows a slew of similar deals. In 2019 the London Stock Exchange (lse) agreed to buy Refinitiv, a financial-data service once owned by Thomson Reuters, for $27bn. In September this year ice bought Ellie Mae, a mortgage-information provider, for $iibn.
Incumbents hope these mega-mergers will allow providers to reap economies of scale and create data bundles that appeal to clients. Like the giants of consumer technology, financial-data firms are seeking to create ""ecosystems"" that clients never have to leave, says Ms Blater. Such scale economies certainly seem to exist for s&p and ihs Markit. The companies expect around $480m in annual savings, but Hamzah Mazarí of Jefferies, an investment bank, thinks they could end up closer to $600m. The transaction should also create revenue-generating synergies, which the pair estimates at an annual $350m. That is because they have complementary businesses and serve the same pool of clients. s&p provides equities indices, for instance, whereas ihs Markit looms large in the pricing of bonds. The combined entity could sell its array of products through enterprise-wide contracts, charging clients a fee for all-you-can-consume data.
All this makes regulators worry about the growing market power of a shrinking group of data providers. European watchdogs are due to make a decision on lse's purchase of Refinitiv by mid-January. But they may not do much to block the union between s&p and ihs Markit. Mr Mazari says overlaps between the firms' businesses do not amount to more than 10-12% of their revenues, so concentration in their various segments will not rise by much. But whether the deals are pulled off or not, their size shows how the industry is being recast. For decades rivals attempted to usurp Bloomberg by offering similar but cheaper platforms. Traders may still clutch at their terminals, but the market for data is being transformed."

WASHINGTON, DC
A diverse, left-leaning economic team conveys the president-elect's priorities
Joe biden's record as president may well hinge on his response to America's economic woes. On December ist the president-elect launched his effort to right the economy, when he formally unveiled his choices for top policy jobs. His economic team stands out for its diversity, its interest in climate change, and its emphasis on the welfare of working people, sending a clear signal of Mr Biden's priorities. Its overriding challenge, though, will be to repair an economy battered by covid-19.
Many of the names on the slate are familiar. If confirmed by the Senate, Janet Yellen will become America's first female treasury secretary. She is assembling one of the more impressive public-service careers in the economics profession, having led the Council of Economic Advisers (cea) during the Clinton administration, and the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018.
Experience aside, Ms Yellen's broad acceptability across Democratic factions no doubt was a point in her favour. By contrast, Mr Biden's CEA-an advisory body of wonks that aims to ground the president's policies in sound economics-may be the most progressive in recent memory. It will be led by Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University, who if confirmed would be the first black woman to chair the council. Ms Rouse is no stranger to Washington, having advised both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during their terms. She has also done impressive research; her work showing that student debt may deter low-income students from enrolling at university, for instance, may be especially pertinent given a running debate in Washington over the wisdom of cancelling student loans. Jared Bernstein, who advised Mr Biden on economic policy during his vice-presidency and has long been an advocate of pro-labour policies, will join Ms Rouse. So too will Heather Boushey, who runs the Washington Centre for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning think-tank. Ms Boushey has argued forcefully that generous government support for women and families is a key ingredient of broad-based prosperity. (Neither Mr Bernstein nor Ms Boushey require Senate confirmation.)
Other appointments have been greeted less warmly by the left. Brian Deese, who has been chosen to lead the National Economic Council, the president's top economic-policymaking body, worked at BlackRock, an asset manager, after serving as an adviser to Mr Obama-causing some to worry about a revolving door between government and business. But Mr Deese's portfolio, which involves directing investment in climate and sustainability initiatives, has muted some of the criticism- and shows the importance that Mr Biden places on tackling climate change.
Neera Tanden, the head of the Centre for American Progress, a left-leaning thinktank, and Mr Biden's choice to run the Office of Management and Budget, is a more divisive figure, known for picking fights with far-left supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders. Republican senators have expressed discomfort with her nomination too; she may face the fiercest confirmation row of them all. But confirmation will be only the first of the team's many challenges. Reforming the economy in the face of a slump and Republican opposition will be no easy task."

Two men are sitting in adjacent restaurant booths. One is talking at length- about train journeys, women, morality, taking chances, living one day at a time. The other is captivated. ""When you die, you're going to regret the things you don't do,"" says the speaker. After more of this, he sighs, pauses and offers his new friend a drink. He then takes out a map. ""This is a piece of land,"" he says. ""Listen to what I'm going to tell you now.""
This is how Richard Roma, the alpha salesman in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", a play by David Mamet, seduces a stranger into buying a tract of undeveloped land. The scene comes to mind when considering the investment case for euro-zone stocks. The phrase ""time to buy European equities"" can elicit the same sort of alarmed response as an invitation to buy Florida swampland. An oblique sales pitch is generally advisable-even though now might be a better time than usual to make it.
How would a stockbroking Ricky Roma sell the euro-zone story? The main thing would be not to oversell it: Europe is hardly transformed. The meat of it is that things are not as bad as you probably think. The euro-zone's weaknesses have not gone away, but are much less crippling. It is likely to do quite well in the early stages of economic recovery. That might just be enough to close the deal.
One sure-thing trade that the euro zone has spawned is in books and articles about how it is a half-finished project. It is a monetary union, but not a political one. The single market is fragmented in services and banking. Tax and spending decisions are made at the national level. But things have changed quite a bit. The European Central Bank looks a lot more like its peers than it did in, say, 2010. Like them, it is more or less committed to reflation. The hawkish German influence on its apparatus has waned. And the pandemic is curing hangups around fiscal stimulus. The European Union's recovery fund is a step towards a shared fiscal policy. It is not huge. But it is not nothing either.
The euro zone's equity market has suffered from a weakness in its make-up: too few of the digital companies of the future; too many of the industrial companies of the past. But time has whittled away at this, too. After years of underperformance, Europe's banks and energy companies had dwindled to a 10% share of market capitalisation by the late summer, as Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley, a bank, noted at the time. Technology had become the largest single sector in the Euro Stoxx 50 benchmark index, at 14%. The public-equity market is still a more cyclical play than that in America. But it is no longer true to say that Europe is a technology desert. Venture capitalists talk excitedly about the strength of the pipeline of software startups across continental Europe.
In any event, it is its old-economy cyclical stocks that are piquing interest. If Europe has been the big loser from the pandemic, it ought to be a big beneficiary of reopening, goes one argument. The forecast for earnings-per-share growth next year is as high as 50% for the Euro Stoxx, according to Mislav Matejka of JPMorgan. A one-off bounce might not impress much. But there is a decent case that euro-zone equities might sustain interest beyond 2021-that the ""runway is longer"", as Mr Secker puts it. The stimulative effect of the eu's recovery fund will probably not be felt until 2022. As global economic recovery takes a stronger hold, investors will start to worry more about higher inflation. That might favour a more longer-lasting tilt towards cyclical stocks.
Why not simply buy emerging-market stocks instead? You still get exposure to companies that benefit from economic recovery; you also get plenty of tech stocks; and on top of all this you benefit from a weaker dollar, which is generally helpful for financing costs in developing economies. Yes, the dollar is expected by many to lose further ground. But what if it doesn't? And what if Treasury yields start to rise quickly? That would be a tricky combination for emerging markets. Europe would be the sounder bet. (A stockbroking Ricky Roma might say that you don't have to choose. Buy a bit of both.)
ABC-always be closing-is the mantra of Roma and his fellow salesmen. It is trickier to seal the deal when the story is not ""things are great"" but rather ""things are a lot better than they were"". Still, this counts as a more-than-decent pitch as far as the euro zone goes, even if it is an odd one to close on. After all, it is mostly about reopening."

The market for song royalties is a hit for investors
Ben stennis is a country-music songwriter from Nashville who has written hits for performers such as Tim McGraw and Jason Aldean. Earlier this year, as the music industry was stopped in its tracks by the coronavirus, a company called Royalty Exchange offered him the chance to raise some cash. Since 2016 it has run an online marketplace that brings together musicians who want to sell their work and punters wanting to invest in royalties. Anthony Martini, a partner in Royalty Exchange, says it has 25,000 potential investors on its books, from pension funds to ""dentists from Ohio"". The rate of investors signing up has doubled this year, compared with 2019.
Music royalties are a complicated business. When a song is recorded, copyrights are created both for the composition of the song and the recording itself. Each of those rights is then split into mechanical rights (generated when a song is sold in a physical format or streamed), performance rights (when it is played on the radio or live at a concert) and synchronisation rights (when it appears in a film, television programme or a video game).
The idea of investing in royalties is not new. In 1985 Michael Jackson forked out $47.5m for the rights to the recordings of around 250 songs by The Beatles; Taylor Swift is trying to buy the rights to some of her master tapes after her previous record label was sold. But firms like Royalty Exchange are making rights affordable to a wider pool of investors; some auctions start with prices in the four figures. (Mr Stennis sold his rights, and paid off his mortgage with the proceeds.)
There are several reasons why music royalties seem attractive at the moment. Mr Martini believes investors are drawn in by a rate of return that is insulated from macroeconomic trends. Music rights offer a predictable stream of income-people tend to tune in no matter what the economy is doing. Owning a song is more fun than buying a slice of a company. And once they have been bought, songs need not require much attention.
Not everyone agrees that buying royalties should be a passive business, though. In 2018 a former manager of Iron Maiden and Guns N' Roses, Merck Mercuriadis, founded an investment company called Hipgnosis. More than 90% of the firm's shares are held by institutional investors, including axa, an insurer, and the Church of England. The aim is to improve the lot of songwriters, who do not have the same opportunities as performers to make money through tours and merchandise.
Hipgnosis has spent more than £650m ($870m) buying the rights to over 13,000 songs. It now owns a share of eight of the 25 most-played songs of all time on Spotify, a streaming platform, including tunes cowritten with Ed Sheeran (""Shape of You"") and Justin Bieber (""Love Yourself""). In addition to the hits, Mr Mercuriadis also wants to boost returns from songs that have ""been left to languish"" by big labels.
Hipgnosis seeks to promote its catalogue by trying to place them in films, tv programmes and streaming playlists. Since it went public in July 2018, the cumulative return on its net asset value is just shy of 40%. Music to investors' ears."

At the touch of a button, you can move your funds into a central-bank digital currency (cbdc), a government-issued virtual store of value that is completely safe.
This is one scenario worrying economists working on cbdcs (of whom there are many: a survey at the start of the year found that more than 80% of central banks were studying the subject). There are many potential advantages to publicly backed digital currencies. They might make payments easier. They might ""democratise"" central-bank money, the part of the central bank's balancesheet which, unlike physical cash, only banks can access now. And they would reduce the risk that cryptocurrencies replace government tender; bitcoin has been on a tear lately, and Facebook's digital coin-which on December 1st changed its name from ""Libra"" to ""Diem""-will reportedly launch in January. But wouldn't cbdcs also make it dangerously easy to flee the banks in times of stress?
It is not just in a crisis that cbdcs might compete with banks. They would be attractive assets to hold in normal times, too, especially if, like today's central-bank money, they were a tool of monetary policy and therefore paid interest (assuming that rates are solidly positive again by 2035). Thus, commercial banks might be drained of the deposits with which they today fund their lending. Disintermediation of the banking system might make impossible the financial magic that allows households to pair long-dated mortgage borrowing with instantaneously redeemable deposits.
The budding architects of cbdcs are looking for ways round the problem. One option, which has been suggested by researchers at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, is to limit the amount that can be held in a cbdc. Another idea, pointed out in a recent paper by Sarah Allen of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts, a research group, and 12 co-authors, is to rely on banks to manage the public's holdings of cbdcs, much as many people rely on ""wallets"" to hold their cryptocurrency (though if the public could not hold cbdcs directly, it would not be much of an improvement on existing central-bank digital money).
The problem of disrupting the banks may be avoidable with clever engineering. But it would be wise to consider whether it even needs avoiding in the first place. For those willing to entertain futuristic ideas, cbdcs may offer an opportunity to rethink the financial system from the ground up.
Several research papers, as summarised by Francesca Carapella and Jean Flemming of the Federal Reserve in a recent review, argue that central banks could preserve maturity transformation by reordering the chain of funding. Today, households deposit money at banks, which park funds at the central bank. If people prefer cbdcs, however, the central bank could in effect pass their funds on to banks by lending to them at its policy interest rate. ""The issuance of cbdc would simply render the central bank's implicit lender-of-last-resort guarantee explicit,"" wrote Markus Brunnermeier of Princeton University and Dirk Niepelt of Study Centre Gerzensee in a paper in 2019. Explicit and, perhaps, in constant use.
More central-bank lending might sound like an unwarranted expansion of government. But today's market for deposits is hardly laissez-faire. It is not as if households inspect banks' loan books before entrusting them with cash; they rely on the backstop of government-provided deposit insurance. And deposits are increasingly concentrated in big banks. (In fact, a recent working paper by researchers of the Bank of Canada finds that, by increasing competition for deposits, a cbdc could increase bank lending and gdp.)
The real problem with central-bank financing of banks is the risk of default. To avoid picking winners, policymakers would probably need to fund any institution that can provide satisfactory collateral. Determining which loans and other assets qualify is uncomfortable work. But central banks already make such evaluations in times of crisis. The understanding that they will accept only high-quality assets, plus minimum equity requirements to protect creditors, is supposed to prevent moral hazard.
Carpe diem
Another idea is to make banks fund themselves with much more equity, rather than rely on deposits. That would make them look more like today's mutual funds or other unleveraged investment vehicles. This is precisely what economists such as John Cochrane of Stanford University and Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University have long advocated: that lenders should shed their dependence on flighty sources of financing, and that households' funds should instead be parked in completely safe assets. For Mr Cochrane, cbdcs are an opportunity to pursue such ""narrow banking"".
To fear disintermediation at the hands of cbdcs is to believe that narrow banking would starve the economy of something it needs, and that today's ""fractional-reserve"" system must be preserved. But banks are not necessary for lending and borrowing to take place-in America a high share of this activity takes place in capital markets instead. If bank credit must be kept flowing, governments could subsidise it directly-making explicit what today's architecture obscures. Better that than suppressing useful technological innovations.
Making subsidies explicit, however, is not always comfortable for the beneficiaries-or for regulators; obvious support attracts more public opprobrium. The real risk of cbdcs to the financial system may be that they eventually precipitate a new kind of run: on the idea that banks need to exist at all. *"

Artificial intelligence is solving one of biology's biggest challenges
To understand life, you must understand proteins. These molecular chains, each assembled from a menu of 20 types of chemical links called amino acids, do biology's heavy lifting. In the guise of enzymes they catalyse the chemistry that keeps bodies running. Actin and myosin, the proteins of muscles, permit those bodies to move around. Keratin provides their skin and hair. Haemoglobin carries their oxygen. Insulin regulates their metabolism. And a protein called spike allows coronaviruses to invade human cells, thereby shutting down entire economies.
Listing a protein's amino acids is easy. Machines to do so have existed for decades. But this is only half the battle in the quest to understand how proteins work. What a protein does, and how it does it, depends also on how it folds up after its creation, into its final, intricate shape.
At the moment, molecular biologists can probe proteins' shapes experimentally, using techniques like x-ray crystallography. But this is fiddly and time-consuming. Now, things may be about to get much easier. On November 30th researchers from DeepMind, an artificial-intelligence (ai) laboratory owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company, presented results suggesting that they have made enormous progress on one of biology's grandest challenges-how to use a computer to predict a protein's shape from just a list of its aminoacid components.
Chain gangs
To non-biologists, this may sound somewhere between arcane and prosaic. In fact, it is a big achievement. Replacing months of experiments with a few hours of computing time could shed new light on the inner workings of cells. It could speed up drug development. And it could in particular suggest treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, in which misshapen proteins are thought to play a role.
But there is yet more to it than that. Until now, the machine-learning techniques which DeepMind's team used to attack the protein-folding problem have been best known for powering things like face-recognition cameras and voice assistants, and for defeating human beings at tricky games like Go. But Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's boss, who founded in 2010 what was then an independent firm, did so hoping that they could also be employed to accelerate the progress of science. This result demonstrates how that might work in practice.
The idea of using computers to predict proteins' shapes is half a century old. Progress has been real, but slow, says Ewan Birney, deputy director of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, a multinational endeavour with headquarters in Germany. And it has been marked by a history of wrong turns and premature declarations of victory.
These days a humbler field, proteinshape prediction now measures its progress by how well algorithms perform in something called Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (casp). This is a biennial experiment-cum-competition which started in 1994 and is jokingly dubbed the ""Olympics of protein-folding"".
In it, algorithms are subjected to blind tests of their ability to predict the shapes of several proteins of known structure.
DeepMind's first entry to casp, two years ago, was dubbed AlphaFold. It made waves by performing much better than any other then-existing program. The current version, AlphaFold 2, has stretched that lead still further (see chart). One measure of success within casp is the global-distance test. This assigns algorithms a score between zero and 100 by comparing the predicted locations of atoms in a molecule's structure with their location in reality. AlphaFold 2 had an average score of 92.4-an accuracy that casp's founder, John Moult, who is a biologist at the University of Maryland, says is roughly comparable with what can be obtained by techniques like x-ray crystallography.
Until now, DeepMind was probably best known for its success in teaching computers to play games-particularly Go, a pastime of deceptively simple rules but fiendish strategy that had been a totem of ai researchers since the field began. In 2016 a DeepMind program called AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, one of the world's best players. Superficially, this may seem of little consequence. But Dr Hassabis says that more similarities exist between proteinfolding and Go than might, at first, appear.
One is the impracticality of attacking either problem with computational brute force. There are thought to be around 10170 legal arrangements of stones on a Go board. That is much greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, and it is therefore far beyond the reach of any computer unless computational shortcuts can be devised.
Proteins are even more complicated than Go. One estimate is that a reasonably complex protein could, in principle, take any of as many as 10300 different shapes. The shape which it does eventually settle into is a result of a balance of various atomscale forces that act within its amino-acid building blocks, between those building blocks, and between the building blocks and other, surrounding, molecules, particularly those of water. These are all matters of considerable complexity which are difficult to measure. It is therefore clear that, as with playing Go, the only way to perform the trick of predicting protein-folding is to look for shortcuts.
The progress that computers have made on the problem over the years demonstrates that these shortcuts do exist. And it also turns out that even inexpert humans can learn such tricks by playing around. Dr Hassabis recalls being struck by the ability of human amateurs to achieve good results with FoldIt, a science-oriented video game launched in 2008 that invites its players to try folding proteins themselves, and which has generated a clutch of papers and discoveries.
Alpha-helix dogs
Getting players of FoldIt to explain exactly what they have been up to, though, is tricky. This is another parallel with Go. Rather than describing step by step what they are thinking, players of both games tend to talk in vaguer terms of ""intuition"" and ""what feels right"". This is where the machine learning comes in. By feeding computers enough examples, they are able to learn and apply shortcuts and rules-ofthumb of the sort that human beings also exploit, but struggle to articulate. Sometimes, the machines come up with insights that surprise human experts. As Dr Moult observes, ""In general, the detail of the backbone [the molecular scaffolding that joins amino acids together] is extraordinary. [AlphaFold 2] has decided that if you don't get the details right, you won't get the big things right. This is a school of thought that's been around for some time, but I thought it wasn't correct.""
As an achievement in ai , AlphaFold 2 is not quite so far ahead of the field as was AlphaGo. Plenty of other research groups have applied machine learning to the protein-structure problem, and have seen encouraging progress. Exactly what DeepMind has done to seize the lead remains unclear, though the firm has promised a technical paper that will delve into the details. For now, John Jumper, the project's leader, points out that machine learning is a box which contains a variety of tools, and says the team has abandoned the system it used to build the original AlphaFold in 2018, after it became clear that it had reached the limits of its ability.
The current version, says Dr Jumper, has more room to grow. He thinks space exists to boost the software's accuracy still further. There are also, for now, things that remain beyond its reach, such as how structures built from several proteins are joined together.
Moreover, as Ken Dill, a biologist at Stony Brook University in New York state, who is the author of a recent overview of the field, points out, what AlphaFold 2, its rivals and, indeed, techniques like x-ray crystallography discover are static structures. Action in biology comes, by contrast, from how molecules interact with each other. ""It is"", he puts it, ""a bit like someone asking how a car works, so you open the hood [bonnet] and take a picture and say, 'There, that's how it works!'"" Useful, in other words, but not quite the entire story.
Nonetheless-and depending on how DeepMind decides to license the technology-an ability to generate protein structures routinely in this way could have a big impact on the field. Around 180m aminoacid sequences are known to science. But only some 170,000 of them have had their structures determined. Dr Moult thinks that boosting this number could help screen drug candidates to see which are likely to bind well to a particular protein. It could be used to reanalyse existing drugs to see what else they might do. And it could boost synthetic biology, by speeding up the creation of human-designed proteins intended to catalyse chemical reactions.
Some promising successes have, indeed, already happened. For example, AlphaFold 2 was able to predict the structures of several of the proteins used by the new coronavirus, including spike. As for Dr Birney, he says, ""We're definitely going to want to spend some time kicking the tyres. But when I first saw these results, I nearly fell off my chair."""

The Starship sn8 is ready for lift off
If all goes well, Elon Musk's plan to conquer the universe will soon take another step forward, with the flight of Starship sn8, a rocket built by his company, SpaceX. sn8 is expected to rise from its launch pad at Boca Chica, in Texas, sometime between December 4th and 6th. (SpaceX have not confirmed this, but a local flight restriction has been imposed on the area for that period.) The idea is that it will fly to an altitude of 15km, cut its engines, tip slowly forward until it is parallel with Earth's surface, and let gravity take its course. Then, shortly before it hits the ground, it will fire its thrusters again to realign itself vertically and will thus come gently to rest on a landing pad a few hundred metres away from where it took off.
sn8 is, as its name suggests, the eighth in the current series of prototypes for SpaceX's proposed Starship (sn stands for ""serial number""). It is, though, the first to have a nose cone, and thus to assume the distinctive atmosphere-penetrating shape normally sported by space rockets. It also has more oomph than its predecessors. Previous sns have used just one of SpaceX's Raptor engines, and have, if launched (some were used for ground tests), reached a height of no more than 150 metres. sn8 includes three Raptors-half the number expected for the finished design.
Strictly, sn8 is a prototype of only the second stage of the Starship that SpaceX proposes eventually to build. Its successors are intended to sit on an as-yet-to-beconstructed ""Super Heavy"" rocket that will deliver the bulk of the firepower. This firststage vehicle is expected to house up to 37 Raptors. These will give it double the thrust developed by the first stage of a Saturn V, the launch vehicle America used for its crewed Moon missions. And the Moon is, indeed, an intended destination, though the craft will earn most of its bread and butter ferrying goods and people into orbits close to Earth-a task for which it has a capacity of 100 tonnes.
Here I am, sitting in my tin can
Crucially, unlike a Saturn V, every part of which except the capsule containing the crew was thrown away during the course of a mission, a Starship will be fully recyclable, with both stages returning to Earth in a manner similar to sn8. Moreover, unlike Saturn's partially recyclable successor, the Space Shuttle, refurbishing a Starship for relaunch will not cost $1bn a pop. Instead, Mr Musk estimates, the turnaround will require only a few million dollars.
Starships should also be cheap to build. Instead of a fancy carbon-fibre composite they are made of stainless steel, which is a seventieth as expensive, but is, in many ways, better. Not only is it resistant to the fracturing to which a composite might be prone in the low temperatures of outer space, but its melting-point is also high enough to prevent damage in the fiery conditions of re-entry. This is an important part of a Starship's easy recyclability.
When an entire Starship will fly is still anyone's guess. Mr Musk has a good record of doing what he says, but his timings have a tendency to slip. For a man who famously once said his ambition was to die on Mars, but not on impact, the Starship project is an important step on the road to his intended retirement home. Bases on the Moon or Mars would need frequent resupply from Earth. That would be made easier by highpowered reusable rockets.
Mr Musk has, himself, put the odds of sn8's flight being successful at three to one against. If it does succeed, however, the odds against his wider vision of the future coming true will shorten. *"

How to track the activities of small-scale fisherfolk
Fish are being plundered from the ocean at an alarming rate. According to the un Food and Agriculture Organisation some 90m tonnes of commercial catch are hauled from the sea every year. And that is only for legitimate, commercial fishing vessels. Even setting aside the huge amount of illegal fishing that goes on, few authorities monitor the activities of the 50m or so fisherfolk who operate small boats in local waters with the aim of feeding their families, or of selling their catch harbourside or into local markets. So an attempt is now under way to collect some of these missing data.
The combined catch of such small-scale fishing could be half as much again as the reported global catch, according to Michel Dejean, director of sustainable fisheries for cls Group. cls is a subsidiary of France's space agency that, among other things, helps monitor, via satellite, the transponders on large fishing boats operating around the world. (Those that switch off their transponders are tracked by radar.)
For small craft, though, cls requires something simpler and cheaper. This is where the group's experience in another area has come in useful-for the organisation also tracks marine birds and sea mammals, and for this it employs low-powered transponders. Engineers at cls have used that expertise to come up with Nemo, a self-contained transponder powered by a built-in solar panel, since many small fishing boats do not have electrical power on board. Nemo is about the size of a shoe. Once attached to a boat, it transmits its position either via satellite or, if within range of local services, mobile phone.
Working with local fishery authorities and other organisations in Asia and South America, cls hopes to have deployed around 1,000 Nemos by the end of 2020. Costs are still being worked out, but the price of such a transponder is generally a few hundred dollars. That compares with several thousand for the sorts of system fitted to large commercial boats. Local fishing groups are also likely to come up with their own schemes to supply or lease the units.
From cls's point of view the idea is that, by knowing when a vessel has put to sea and where it has been fishing, it will be possible to build up a clearer picture of how small-scale fisheries operate in particular places. Also, reported catches can be verified against vessels' actual locations. For this to stand any chance of working, however, fisherfolk must be persuaded that they, too, have an interest in having a Nemo attached to their boat. To do this, says Mr Dejean, means building a good safety and business case.
As far as safety is concerned, fishdepleted inshore waters mean that many people are being forced to sail farther out to sea-often beyond mobile-phone range. This scuppers their only way of contacting home if something goes wrong. Nemo's satellite connection overcomes that, and, to make doubly sure, the device is fitted with a single-button distress beacon which can summon help in a crisis. As to commercial incentive, the record of fishing grounds visited will, cls hopes, allow crews to obtain higher prices from concerned customers by proving their catches come from ""sustainable"" sources.
Whether either of these baits will, in practice, hook enough of the world's small fisherfolk remains to be seen. But even if only a few sign up, it may help plug a worrying hole in the planet's fishery data. *"

Covid-19 vaccines will soon be rushing into people's arms. Are they safe?
ON DECEMBER 2ND Britain became the first country to permit the general use of a fully tested covid-19 vaccine. The decision to grant this emergency authorisation had been made late the previous evening by the country's Medicines and Healthcare-products Regulatory Agency (mhra).
The vaccine licensed is code-named BNT162b2 and was developed by Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical giant, and BioNTech, a smaller German firm. It has an efficacy of 95%, a figure that seems consistent across a range of ages and ethnicities. Britain had already ordered 40m doses of BNT162b2 and Pfizer, as soon as it was informed of the decision, activated the procedures needed to start importing it from the site in Puurs, Belgium, where it is being made. The plan is to start vaccinating people on December 7th, and Matt Hancock, Britain's chief health minister (pictured), has said that he expects ""a matter of millions of doses"" of the vaccine to be available in the country by the end of the year.
According to Pfizer, other countries are now looking to Britain and wondering if they can similarly speed up their regulatory processes. And the World Health Organisation, which runs an emergency licensing procedure for countries without medical regulators, said on December 2nd that it was in discussions with the mhra about the details of that agency's assessment, in order to expedite its own work in this area.
Safety first
The speed with which this anticovid vaccine and others are moving through some of the world's regulatory systems is a result of rolling reviews of their trials. Instead of waiting for firms to collate and submit full data-and-safety packages, regulators have studied results as they became available.
For some, though, things are not moving quickly enough. On December 1st, the day before Britain's announcement, Stephen Hahn, the head of America's Food and Drug Administration (fda), was summoned to the White House to answer questions about why his agency has not moved faster to approve BNT162b2. As it happens, both the fda and its counterpart in the European Union, the European Medicines Agency, have arranged public meetings in coming weeks in which covid-19 vaccines will be discussed ahead of regulatory decisions. Melanie Ivarsson, chief development officer at Moderna, an American firm that announced encouraging results for its own vaccine, mRNA-1273, a week after Pfizer and BioNTech, said these were important, as they allow independent experts to look at the safety and the analysis, and also let the public ask questions-something that will build confidence in these vaccines. ""We want people to feel really comfortable,"" says Dr Ivarsson.
Both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 belong to a class known as mRNA vaccines. Though this is the first time such a vaccine has been authorised for human use, experts are optimistic about their general safety because they have been tested in various cancer-related applications for over a decade. As to BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in particular, these have now been in trials involving 73,000 volunteers, half of whom have been given the vaccine and the other half a placebo of some sort. This constitutes a hefty set of data. And both vaccines seem to have been well tolerated, with no serious adverse events recorded.
On top of all this, health authorities have already laid safety-related follow-up plans, says Penny Ward, chairwoman of the education and standards committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a British group of doctors. These include systems for examining apparent adverse reactions and using anonymised health-care records to see how incidence of covid-19 varies between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. One concern with any new vaccine is that it may increase the risk of infection in some groups. Another is that, in rare cases, vaccines trigger autoimmune reactions-something viral infections also do. With covid-19 vaccines being delivered to hundreds of millions, and then billions of people, much surveillance will be needed.
There are, as it happens, reasons to think that mRNA vaccines might actually be safer than some other kinds. Live vaccines (that against polio, for example) are weakened versions of the virus itself. This brings a risk that the virus will revert to a more dangerous form. With an mRNA vaccine, which is merely a bunch of strands of genetic material-mRNA-encapsulated in tiny spheres of fat, this cannot happen. This mRNA encodes not the instructions for how to make a virus, but rather how to make just one of its proteins, called spike. Thus directed, body cells turn out spike in quantity, and that stimulates a response which primes the immune system to react quickly if it comes across spike again-this time as part of an invading virus.
Also, mRNA is a natural component of living cells, which make and destroy it continuously. Its turnover rate is measured in days. So, once the mRNA from the vaccine has done its job it is quickly broken down. Yet misinformation is already being spread. One particularly pernicious falsehood is that the mRNA in the vaccine will alter a recipient's dna. This is about as likely as Isaac Newton's apple falling upwards. RNA and dna are different, and mammalian cells have no molecular mechanism for transcribing the former into the latter.
Maintaining public trust in any authorised vaccine is important. That trust may be more forthcoming in Britain than in many places. Polls say 79% of the country's inhabitants intend to get vaccinated against covid-19, which is above the international average. In America, for example, only 64% state such an intention.
But whose safety exactly?
Ultimately all decisions to approve medicines are made on a balance of risks versus benefits. For the approval of a vaccine, however, the likely benefits must vastly outweigh the possible risks. This is because, unlike drugs, which are generally prescribed to those who are already sick, vaccines are usually administered to healthy people.
The mhra, for one, takes advice from an independent scientific committee in making its choices. But, though its members will have taken into account many factors when deciding to grant emergency authorisation to BNT162b2, one brutal calculation will surely have been near the fronts of their minds. This is that each day of waiting will be measured in lost lives. In Britain alone, on the day the government gave permission to use BNT162b2, covid-19 killed 603 people. *"

Politics and current affairs
Kleptopia: How Dirty Money is Conquering the World. By Tom Burgis. Harper; 464 pages; $28.99. William Collins; £20
It is hard to write about international corruption in an accessible and colourful way, while retaining an urgent sense of moral condemnation. This book beautifully captures both the murkiness and turpitude involved. Its ultimate theme-the intersection of politics and personal enrichment-is one of the most important stories of the age.
Putin's People. By Catherine Belton. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 640 pages; $35. William Collins; £25
Many books have tried to explain the rise and ruthlessness of Vladimir Putin; this one is the closest yet to a definitive account. It draws on extensive interviews and archival sleuthing to tell a vivid story of cynicism and violence. On this view, a massive concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few is used to quash dissent and project force abroad.
Eat the Buddha: Life and Death in a Tibetan Town. By Barbara Demick. Random House; 352pages; $28. Granta;£18.99
This is the grippingly told story of Ngaba, a county seat near the edge of the Tibetan plateau, and of the sufferings of its people under the Chinese Communist Party's rule. Exploring an area rarely visited by foreigners, the author paints striking portraits of people living there, with a fine eye for detail and a keen grasp of Tibet's history.
Irreversible Damage. By Abigail Shrier. Regnery Publishing; 276 pages; $28.99 and £22
A critical look at the enormous rise in recent years in people identifying as trans, especially among girls. It covers a brewing scandal over the provision of irreversible treatments, whether surgical or pharmaceutical, to teenagers. Predictably controversial-yet there is not a drop of animosity in the book.
Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot. By John Lloyd. Polity; 224 pages; $25 and £20
A timely, forceful rehearsal of the painful consequences that might follow independence for Scotland, and of the virtues of union with England. The author, a distinguished journalist, makes a case for enhanced devolution, powerfully enlisting and evoking his own childhood in a Scottish fishing village.
Why the Germans Do It Better. By John Kampfner. Atlantic Books; 320 pages; £16.99
This breezy but comprehensive paean argues that Germany's culture of consensus and stability has bred a resilience unusual among crisis-prone democracies. Despite the teasing title-a jab at the author's native Britain-it acknowledges Germany's problems, from creaking infrastructure to somnolent foreign policy.
Twilight of Democracy. By Anne Applebaum. Doubleday;224 pages; $25. Allen Lane; £16.99
Mixing personal anecdote and analysis, a well-connected historian of communism chronicles the collapse of the international liberal coalition that was forged during the cold war. A perceptive insight into the rise of authoritarian populism.
Biography and memoir
Black Spartacus. By Sudhir Hazareesingh. Farrar, Straus and Giroux;464 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25
The subject of this superbly researched book was born a slave and grew up to be the leading figure in the uprising of 1791, in modern Haiti, which reverberated around the world. Fragmentary records have until now meant Toussaint Louverture was a shadowy historical character; this reconstruction gives his political, military and intellectual accomplishments their due.
A Promised Land. By Barack Obama. Crown Publishing Group; 768pages; $45. Viking; £35
There is little score-settling and much introspection in this account of the author's rise to the White House and his first few years in it. Reflective and reasonable almost to a fault, the book is also a reminder that the 44th president is one of the best writers ever to serve in that office.
Stranger in the Shogun's City. By Amy Stanley. Scribner;352pages;$28. Chatto & Windus; £16.99
Set in the first half of the 19th century, this story of an obscure woman's everyday struggles in what is now Tokyo is a triumph of scholarship. Using a trove of documents about her downtrodden subject, the author lifts the veil on a halfremembered world of beauty and cruelty.
House of Glass. By Hadley Freeman. Simon & Schuster;352 pages; $26. Fourth Estate; £16.99
Living out her final years in Florida, the author's grandmother, Sala, longed for Paris. She was actually born in what today is Poland, fleeing from the pogroms to France. Her family's intricately reconstructed lives are a moving parable of the Jewish 20th century. One of her brothers was murdered in Auschwitz. Another leapt from a train, joined the resistance and later became friends with Picasso.
Kiss Myself Goodbye. By Ferdinand Mount. Bloomsbury; 272 pages; $30 and £20
This is the hilarious tale of a bizarre, multibigamist, pathologically inventive aunt in raffish, upper-class Britain either side of the second world war. Part detective story, part social history, it moves from the backstreets of Sheffield to Claridges.
History
Underground Asia. By Tim Harper. Harvard University Press; 864 pages; $39.95. Allen Lane; £35
A brilliant study of Asian revolutionary movements in the first decades of the 20th century, showing how a collective consciousness emerged in the liminal cracks of empire-in steerage class on steamships, in the doss houses of port cities and radical circles in London and Paris. Western ideas raced back to Asia, undermining colonial rule. The revolutionaries' big truth, says the author, was that Asia lay ""at the forefront of human futures"".
Every Drop of Blood. By Edward Achorn. Atlantic Monthly Press;336 pages; $28. Black Cat; £19.99
Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address, delivered towards the end of the civil war, is etched on the wall of his memorial in Washington. Declining to gloat, the soon-to-be victorious-and assassinated-president instead advocated ""malice toward none"" and ""charity for all"". This book richly evokes the intellectual origins and context of a speech that remains a model of political magnanimity.
A House in the Mountains. By Caroline Moorehead. Harper;416pages; $29.99. Chatto & Windus; £20
After the country capitulated to the Allies in 1943, around 80,000 partisans in northern Italy died in a fight for freedom against fascist loyalists and their Nazi backers. Weaving deep research into a compelling narrative, this book tells the story of four women involved in the struggle.
Alaric the Goth. By Douglas Boin. W.W. Norton; 272 pages; $26.95 and £19.99
History may mostly be written by the victors, but the destruction of Rome by the far less literate Goths in 410AD is an exception. This colourful portrait of the city and empire in the fifth century tells their side of the story. Rich Romans lived in splendour while Goths endured slavery. Alaric, their leader, served in the Roman army- before turning on the oppressors.
India's Founding Moment. By Madhav Khosla. Harvard University Press;240 pages; $45 and £36.95
A punchy reminder of the success of India's birth as a democratic republic. The genius of its constitution kept the country on course for seven decades of peace and (slow) growth; but it has suffered erosion in the era of Narendra Modi.
Fiction
The Slaughterman's Daughter. By Yaniv Iczkovits. T ranslated by Orr Scharf. MacLehose Press; 528 pages; £18.99. To be published in America by Schocken in February; $28.95
Echoes of Russian and Yiddish literature resound in this delightful picaresque, but you need not hear them to enjoy it. It is the late 19th century, and a Jewish mother in the Pale of Settlement sets out to retrieve her wayward brother-in-law from Minsk. Technicolour characters, pathos and humour are all wonderfully captured in a nimble translation from the Hebrew.
Shuggie Bain. By Douglas Stuart. Grove Press; 448 pages; $17. Picador; £14.99
This richly told coming-of-age story, set in the deprived Glasgow of the 1980s, won this year's Booker prize. Though the title character charms with his humorous sideways look at the world, the emotional centre of the book is his ""disintegrating mother"", Agnes, whose high hopes are tragically derailed by alcoholism.
My Dark Vanessa. By Kate Elizabeth Russell. William Morrow;384 pages; $27.99. Fourth Estate; £12.99
The title comes from a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and the story is in part a reworking of ""Lolita"", recounting a teenage girl's grooming and abuse by a middle-aged teacher. In intercut sections she looks back on those events from adulthood, through a haze of twisted memory. A powerful tale that will strike a chord with many women-but really ought to be read by men.
The Glass Hotel. By Emily St John Mandel. Knopf;320 pages; $26.95. Picador; £14.99
This immersive novel's main character is a bartender who becomes the trophy wife of a con-man, then a cook on a container ship. Evoking the atmosphere of the financial crash of 2008, its real theme is the difficulty of outrunning the past. ""There are so many ways to haunt a person,"" the author writes, ""or a life.""
The Ministry for the Future. By Kim Stanley Robinson. Orbit; 576 pages; $28 and £20
Climate change is a notoriously tough subject for novelists-this is its most important treatment for some time. Led by an Irish former minister, an intergovernmental body explores avenues from terrorism to geoengineering to central banking as it bids to avert disaster. At times horrifying, at others seeming almost to spin out of control, the book is powered by a hopeful yet illusionless vision of the future.
Homeland Elegies. By Ayad Akhtar. Little, Brown; 368 pages; $28. Tinder Press; £18.99
A dazzling, part-autobiographical tale about growing up as a Pakistani-American through the age of 9/11 and then Donald Trump. It grapples with ambivalence about Islam, permanent feelings of unbelonging and the hazards of material success. By a Pulitzer-prizewinning playwright.
The Perfect Nine. By Ngugi wa Thiong'o. The New Press; 240 pages; $23.99. Harvill Seeker; £12
Most writers lose their energy and inventiveness as they grow old. Not the 82-year-old Kenyan author of this fresh and magical novel. Written in galloping blank verse, it tells of the very first Kikuyu and their passionate attachment to Mount Kenya, the home of their god, Ngai.
Burnt Sugar. By Avni Doshi. The Overlook Press; 240 pages; $26. Hamish Hamilton; £14.99
""I would be lying,"" the narrator begins, ""if I said my mother's misery has never given me pleasure."" Antara, now an adult, cannot forgive her parent's failings and cruelties yet feels compelled to care for her as dementia takes hold. This gripping debut novel probes the ties that bind as well as the slippery nature of memory.
Culture and ideas
Magdalena: River of Dreams. By Wade Davis. Knopf; 432 pages; $30. Bodley Head; £25
The river of the title is the heart and soul of Colombia. As well as bisecting the country, the waterway is ""the wellspring of Colombian music, literature, poetry and prayer"", says the author, a Canadian anthropologist and explorer. Travelling the 1,000-mile length of the Magdalena, on foot, horseback, by car or-often-by boat, he has produced an enchanting chronicle blending culture, ecology and history.
Mozart: The Reign of Love. By Jan Swafford. Harper; 832 pages; $45. Faber & Faber; £30
Mozart's compositions, notes this outstanding account of his life and work, display ""a kind of effortless perfection so easily worn that they seem almost to have written themselves"". In this telling Mozart was a fundamentally happy man, a genius with an enduringly childish sense of humour. The author, a composer himself, peppers his narrative with penetrating insights into the music.
Time of the Magicians. By Wolfram Eilenberger. Translated by Shaun Whiteside. Penguin; 432 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25
High thinking and low politics meet in this lively group portrait of four revolutionary German-language philosophers in the 1920s. Ludwig Wittgenstein, Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger all gazed thrillingly into the post-war cultural abyss; as a Nazi stooge, Heidegger jumped in. Only the decent, liberal Ernst Cassirer, ""thinker of the possible"", entirely kept his head.
Leo Tolstoy. By Andrei Zorin. Reaktion Books; 224 pages; $19 and £11.99
The lineaments of Tolstoy's astonishing life are well known: the libertinism, the remorse, the masterpieces, the infamously unhappy marriage and death at the train station in Astapovo. But this elegant, perceptive biography weaves together his times, his writing, his faith and his political activism into a single, seamless whole.
150 Glimpses of the Beatles. By Craig Brown. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 592 pages; $30. Published in Britain as ""One, Two, Three, Four""; Fourth Estate; £20
Books about the Beatles often get bogged down in minute details of the band's career. This one cuts through the morass with wit and style, in an ingenious history that homes in on 150 revealing and entertaining anecdotes. Ringo comes out well, the others not so much.
Science and technology
A Dominant Character. By Samanth Subramanian. W.W. Norton;400pages;$40. A tlantic Books; £20
The subject of this astute book was a giant of British science. J.B.S Haldane helped flesh out Darwin's theory of natural selection by marrying it to genetics and grounding it in maths. He served in the trenches during the first world war and wrote prodigiously. A committed communist, he was slow to acknowledge the Soviet Union's depredations. ""Even if the professors leave politics alone,"" he remarked, ""politics won't leave the professors alone.""
The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking). By Katie Mack. Scribner; 240 pages; $26. Allen Lane; £20
The universe had a beginning and, one day, it will end. The author uses the latest physics to explore the possibilities for doomsday. Despite her solemn theme, her humour and eclectic references (from Shakespeare to ""Battlestar Galactica"") carry the book along. Even through discussions of cutting-edge science, the general reader is never bewildered.
The Human Cosmos. By Jo Marchant. Dutton; 400 pages; $28. Canongate; £16.99
From the beginning of human civilisation, religion, art and science have been preoccupied by the stars and other celestial wonders. This is a thought-provoking look at how fascination with the heavens has shaped human culture, and still does.
Privacy is Power. By Carissa Véliz. Bantam Press;288 pages; £12.99. To be published in America in June; $24.95
The constant and ubiquitous collection of data on private citizens is an abusive system that undermines their rights, argues an Oxford philosopher. Her solutions, such as banning the trade in personal data, may be extreme, but she galvanises an urgent conversation.
Apollo's Arrow. By Nicholas Christakis. Little, Brown; 384 pages; $29 and £20
A leading sociologist and scientist considers the history of plagues and how some countries blundered in their responses to covid-19. Pandemics are not just biological but sociological, he notes: viruses mutate but human behaviour changes, too.
Business and economics
No Filter. By Sarah Frier. Simon & Schuster; 352 pages; $28. Random House Business; £20
Drawing on the author's close access to insiders at Instagram, this is a lively and revealing view of how the world came to see itself through the platform's lens. Her tale includes glimpses of Silicon Valley's weirdness, and an account of Instagram's sale to Facebook-and its sour aftermath.
No Rules Rules. By Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer. Penguin Press;320pages; $28. Virgin Books; £20
Limitless holiday and no formal expense caps sound like a recipe for corporate chaos. In a rare book by a chief executive that is both readable and illuminating, the boss of Netflix-and his co-author-explain how he arrived at these and other radical management rules, and why they are not as bonkers as they sound.
The Price of Peace. By Zachary Carter. Random House; 656 pages; $35 and £25
This wonderfully written portrait of John Maynard Keynes traces the evolution of his thinking about political economy. It recasts his contributions to 20th-century intellectual life in a way both enlightening and truer to his thought than most accounts given in the classroom.
The Myth of Chinese Capitalism. By Dexter Roberts. St Martin's Press;288 pages; $28.99 and £22.99
An unvarnished look at the rural migrants who have fuelled China's long boom but remain second-class citizens. The author combines sharp analysis with the story of a family he followed for two decades.
Fully Grown. By Dietrich Vollrath. University of Chicago Press;296 pages; $27.50 and £20
A wide-ranging and original study of the slowdown in economic growth in America in recent decades. The author attributes it to the exhaustion of returns from the spread of education and women entering the workforce, and the switch towards services as people have become richer. These trends are welcome, he argues: a lack of low-hanging fruit means you have successfully picked it all.
Open: The Story of Human Progress. By Johan Norberg. A tlantic Books; 448 pages; $24.95 and £20
Progress depends on openness, this book contends, yet that creates a backlash, since people are hard-wired to fear rapid change. The author marshals arresting examples from every continent and era, ending on an optimistic, timely note. Recent years have seen the rise of populist demagogues who want to pull up drawbridges-but such leaders eventually lose power because they are hopeless at governing."

Our correspondents pondered economics, jewellery, revolution and the pandemic
More. By Philip Coggan. Hachette; 496 pages; $34. Profile Books; £25
A history of the global economy by our Bartleby columnist. Covering the development of key sectors such as manufacturing and energy production, it shows how links between people and countries have allowed individuals to grow not just more prosperous, but taller and stronger, and to live longer and have more choice in how they run their lives. A ""brilliant survey"", thought the Times; a ""fantastic sweep"", reckoned the Financial Times.
Coveted. By Melanie Grant. Phaidon; 208 pages; $89.95 and £69.95
When, asks the picture and luxury editor of 1843, does jewellery make the leap from fashion accessory to art? Her richly illustrated profiles of leading designers range from Fabergé's and Cartier's links to Art Nouveau and Art Deco, to the collaboration between Georg Jensen, a Scandinavian brand, with the architect Zaha Hadid. The New York Times said the book showed ""the complexity, power and artistic impact of great design"".
Independence Square. By A.D. Miller. Pegasus Books;228pages; $25.95. Harvill Secker; £14.99
A nation's future, and a man's fate, hang in the balance in this novel of revolution and betrayal. Set between an icy upheaval in Kyiv and a London summer, it stars a sly oligarch, an idealistic young activist and a disgraced British diplomat. ""Utterly gripping,"" said the Observer, ""a novel with its finger on the pulse of geopolitics that still manages to move deeply."" The Spectator called it ""a searing indictment of our times"". By our culture editor.
Unconventional Wisdom. Edited by Tom Standage. Economist Books; 272 pages; $11.99. Profile Books; £8.99
A compendium of our explainer articles and daily charts, which spell out how much a ghost reduces a house's value, how pregnancy makes people more law-abiding and why friends prefer sloppily wrapped Christmas gifts. Compiled by one of our deputy editors.
The Best. By Tim Wigmore and Mark Williams. Mobius;256pages; $24.95. Nicholas Brealey; £20
A contributor on sport and his co-author cover topics such as why younger siblings have more chance of becoming elite sportsmen, why mid-sized towns produce the most champions and the science of performance. They draw on interviews with Marcus Rashford, Pete Sampras and Steph Curry, among others. ""Excellent,"" said the Australian.
The Classical School. By Callum Williams. Hachette; 288 pages; $16.99. Profile Books; £20
A high-speed history of Western economic thought, by our senior economics writer, told in the form of 20 biographies. Alongside household names such as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, there are chapters on lesser-known figures such as Harriet Martineau and Dadabhai Naoroji. The Times called it a ""brisk, absorbing and entertaining history lesson"" with ""an engaging cast of characters"" that ""leaves you a lot wiser"".
The Wake-Up Call. By Adrian Wooldridge and John Micklethwait. HarperVia; 176 pages; $18. Short Books; £9.99
The pandemic, say our political editor and Bloomberg's editor-in-chief, proves that government is not just a diversion for politicians but a matter of life and death. The poor performance of Western democracies, particularly America and Britain, shows how far they have fallen behind the Far East, notably China. ""A shot in the arm,"" said the Financial Times. ""Full marks for sounding the alarm,"" said the Times Literary Supplement.

5-Dec-20,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/2467349141/fulltext/45A019D69C8D4382PQ/70?accountid=14657,"A covid-19 vaccine will help humanity, but not some firms' share prices
WHEN PFIZER and BioNTech, two pharmaceutical companies, revealed in November that their covid-19 vaccine was over 90% effective, health experts celebrated around the world. Stockmarkets, however, responded with a mere golf clap. The s&p 500, a technology-heavy index of big American firms, rose by just 1.2% that day.
There are at least two plausible explanations for this muted reaction. One is that investors already expected such success. Although markets' views on vaccine prospects cannot be measured directly, Good Judgment, a consultancy that uses a group of ""superforecasters"" to make predictions, offers a proxy. In April it began publishing a daily probability that enough vaccines to inoculate 25m Americans will be distributed by March 31st 2021. When Pfizer released its results, the forecasters raised this value from 53% to 88%, showing that the outcome was indeed a surprise. (Pfizer's own shares also rose by 7.7% on the news.)
That leaves the other probable cause of the markets' mixed signals: a successful vaccine may not help companies that have benefited from social changes caused by covid-19. In one study testing this theory, Goldman Sachs, a bank, analysed how shares in each industry had responded to shifts in the odds of an early-arriving vaccine. It found that technology companies, whose products have enjoyed faster adoption during lockdowns, lagged behind the market when vaccine prospects improved. Conversely, energy and materials firms rallied the most under such conditions.
To expand on this research, we have applied its ""excess return"" calculation-performance relative to market averages-to all listed firms worldwide worth at least $10bn, on every day since April 27th. We then measured the relationship between each company's excess returns and daily changes in the superforecasters' estimated probability of mass vaccination by March 2021. Finally, we grouped the results by industry, breaking out the sub-sectors most likely to show large effects.
This method yielded a more intuitive list of winners and losers. Hotel, restaurant and airline shares have traded closely in line with the vaccine's estimated arrival date. In contrast, consumer-durables firms-including manufacturers of swimming-pool supplies, appliances and exercise bicycles-tended to trail behind the market when vaccine producers made breakthroughs, and beat it when they suffered setbacks. Health-care stocks (save those of vaccine makers themselves), and technology and e-commerce firms buoyed by lockdowns, also showed this pattern.
However, we also found more surprising results. Financial firms' fortunes tend to mirror the broader economy, but the link between progress on vaccines and financial stock returns was unusually strong- nearly as robust as for leisure companies. Banks, which have made big provisions for loan defaults, would enjoy a windfall if such losses do not occur. And credit-card issuers like American Express will gain from the return of international travel.
Meanwhile, retailers' share performance has been curiously uncorrelated to vaccine news. When Pfizer announced its results, shares of discount department stores like Burlington, Ross and tjx surged. However, those of big-box stores such as Best Buy and Target sold off-perhaps because investors expected consumers to switch to other types of spending once they feel safe travelling and mingling again."

Sent on an errand, or packed off to school, Diego Maradona didn't walk. He practised keepie-uppies, instep to thigh to backheel to head, with anything roughly round he could find. Scrumpled paper would do, or an orange, or a ball of rags. Tac-tac-tac, on and on and on. Then he hopped on his right foot, especially up the steps of the railway bridge, while his left foot tried out skills. If no one was wanting him he would head for the waste ground of Villa Fiorito, one of the worst shanty-towns in Buenos Aires, but home to him, to have kickabouts with friends until night fell, or later.
He wanted nothing from life but football. He could live on it. Then, perhaps, he might have enough money to buy a second pair of trousers to replace the tired old corduroys he always wore, winter and summer. Little did he think that by 1986, after playing for Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors in the first division, at Barcelona and at Napoli, as well as in the national side, he would be able to have all the fine clothes he wanted, as well as all the flash cars; and that he would be on a podium in Mexico City, as Argentina's captain, kissing and shaking the shining gold World Cup, hardly knowing what to do with it, except to keep it in his hands.
How had he been propelled so far, so fast? Evidently God, the Beard as he called him, had something to do with it. The Beard had plans for him, starting with the squat, strong body He gave him, and the huge thighs, which made it almost impossible to tackle him at speed. He filled him with love of the beauty and possibility of the game, and with talent that saw him transferred for record sums of money. There were other good assists, too. In the 1986 World Cup quarter-final against England, where God's hand and his own fist shot up to engineer a goal he knew was illegal, the Beard then blinded the officials so they didn't see it. Four minutes later the Beard helped out to create the goal of his life, allowing him to weave past five England players, trick the goalie with a dummy-tic-and put the ball in, tac.
A certain urchin cunning also helped. It showed in the way he played, revelling in tricks and touches: nutmegs, like his debut pass in his first game for Argentinos Juniors, straight through a defender's legs; back-heel flicks and sombreros, kicking the ball over an opponent to retrieve it on the other side. Humiliating England, he said, was like stealing a wallet. Though he hated being called a hustler, he had to take every chance. It might look like cheating or deceiving, or it might be skill. The line was narrow sometimes. If it won games, it didn't matter. His drug problems started in the same way: if ephedrine or cocaine gave him an edge over the opposition, fine. He was sure he could control it as sweetly as a ball, at the beginning. Things got a lot more complicated later.
What really fuelled him, though, was anger, bronca, fury tinged with resentment. Life in Villa Fiorito, in a struggling family of ten in a tiny corrugated-iron house on a bone-crusher's wage, was a giant kick up the backside. He had to get out or go under, and defeat was unbearable. Because he was so small and young in his first teams, he was sometimes left on the bench, and couldn't stand it. He would weep for hours, knowing he was as good as anyone, better, and could prove it. When César Menotti left him out of Argentina's World Cup squad in 1978, when he was so up for it, he got his own back by leading the youth team to victory in the World Youth Cup the next year. He did not forgive Menotti. Most of the coaches and managers he dealt with, he thought, betrayed him somehow. They held him back, or forced him to train when he preferred to sleep. One even tried to teach him a sliding tackle, down to the ground. He would never go down to the ground, unless pushed.
Sometimes his longing for revenge went as far as war. When Barcelona lost the final of the Copa del Rey, Spain's fa Cup, in 1984 to Athletic Bilbao, and a Bilbao player gave him two fingers, he started a mighty brawl on the pitch in front of the king himself. In 1986, marching out to take on England, his mind was full of Argentina's defeat in the Malvinas not so long before, and the Argentine boys who had died there, killed like little birds.
It was not only his country he wanted to defend but, often, himself. The media infuriated him, to the point where he once opened fire with an air rifle on a posse of reporters who came to his house. They hammered him over women and, especially, drugs. Those had led to a 15-month ban at Napoli in 1991 and in 1994 to his ejection from the World Cup in the United States mid-tournament, but he argued that he was largely innocent. At Barça he had got into the habit of testing himself, and found himself quite clean. In 1994 he blamed his personal coach for giving him a power drink full of American chemicals. As for his hobnobbing with the Camorra crime syndicate at Napoli, he considered them protectors and nice people, who gave him gold Rolexes and seemed to want nothing in return. But then he never had much of a handle on his business affairs. He left those to others, while he had fun.
In other ways Napoli showed him at his best. He went to a poor, volatile southern city, scorned by the rich north, and won major trophies for it, the first it had ever had. He was revered as a saint for restoring its pride by thrashing everybody else. And of course he had done that first in Argentina, idolised like God himself for salving with his brilliance the loss of the Malvinas and the junta years. Yet winning the World Cup, he mused as he came home, had not brought down the price of bread. Only politicians who spoke for the masses could do that. So he was both a Peronist and a chavista; Fidel Castro (whose beret he begged from him) was tattooed on his left leg, Che Guevara on his right arm. He told the pope that he should sell the Vatican's gold ceilings to feed the poor.
As he grew stouter and sicker, he coached the national side and returned as director of Boca Juniors, the team he had most wanted to play for as a boy. His aim stayed just the same, to bring joy to people with a ball. He was el Diego de la gente, the people's player. And despite the force of the kick that Villa Fiorito had given him, up to the stars, he still felt he had those corduroy trousers on, the old pair he always wore, winter and summer."

Thousands of people, mostly the very elderly and frontline health workers, received the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in hospitals. Family doctors will also administer the injections, as will care homes by Christmas. Canada became the second country to approve the Pfizer vaccine and will start distribution soon. In America regulators were on the verge of approving it.
General Lloyd Austin was tapped by Joe Biden to be his defence secretary. If confirmed, General Austin, who has led America's command in Afghanistan and Iraq, will be the first black person to hold the job. He will also be a former military man in a position that by tradition goes to a civilian. Donald Trump's first defence secretary, James Mattis, also came from the armed forces.
The House of Representatives passed a defence bill, with 140 Republican votes, that would, among other things, remove the names of Confederate generals that adorn some military bases. Mr Trump says he will reject the bill, but it has been approved by a two-thirds majority, enough support to override a presidential veto. It now goes to the Senate.
The House also passed a bill that would decriminalise marijuana and overturn the sentences of those who have been convicted of non-violent cannabis crimes. Its purpose is to redress the racial disparities in marijuana convictions (black people are more likely to be jailed for possession). It is unlikely to pass the Senate.
The Supreme Court made its first foray into the jumble of lawsuits from Republicans still trying to overturn the election result. In a one-line response with no dissents, it refused to hear a case from Pennsylvania. Joe Biden's victory will be officially confirmed on December 14th, when the electoral college meets to cast its vote.
As Brexit trade talks went down to the wire, the British government announced an ""agreement in principle"" with the European Union over border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Britain also agreed to scotch legislation that would allow it to break international law. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, went to Brussels for a dinner with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, but their meeting left a bad taste in the mouth for those hoping for a breakthrough.
France published details of a proposed new law designed to combat the spread of radical Islam. The law, which will go to parliament next year, was prompted by the beheading of a French schoolteacher for showing children cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
Venezuela's dictatorial regime, led by Nicolás Maduro, reclaimed control of the legislature, the one branch of government it did not command. The ruling psuv and its allies won more than twothirds of the votes in a legislative election that was boycotted by most of the opposition. The psuv's victory means that the opposition's leader, Juan Guaidó, recognised as Venezuela's interim president by more than 50 countries, will lose his role as head of the assembly.
Tabaré Vázquez, who was twice Uruguay's president, died. A doctor turned left-wing politician, Mr Vázquez's victory in 2004 ended more than 160 years of rule by the National and Colorado parties. His second term ended in March this year.
Opposition candidates made gains in a parliamentary election in Kuwait, raising fears that they will stand in the way of efforts to tackle a fiscal crisis caused by low oil prices and the outbreak of covid-19. None of the 29 female candidates who ran won a seat.
Ethiopian federal troops fired at un workers who were assessing roads to provide aid in Tigray, a war-torn region. Fighting erupted in November between the central government and Tigrayan forces, after Tigray held what the government called an illegal election. The government has shut internet and telephone access to the region. Thousands have died and perhaps 1m have fled their homes.
Five people were killed in election-related violence in Ghana. Both presidential and parliamentary races were close. Results showed that Nana Akufo-Addo won a second term as president, narrowly beating his predecessor, John Mahama, who said the election was flawed.
Opposition leaders in India complained that the government was preventing them from joining farmers protesting against recent agricultural reforms, which would curb price supports for crops. The protesters rejected an offer to revise the reforms.
Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the eldest son of Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, was elected mayor of the city of Surakarta, the job that launched his father's career.
Rarely can a mountain stretch its advantage over its rivals, but this week Everest did just that. Nepal and China, the two countries that the ""goddess mother of the world"" straddles, agreed that the correct height is 8,848.86 metres above sea level, 86cm above the previous height, established in 1954 by a survey in India. China did its own estimate in 2005 and had insisted that Everest was four metres shorter.
America's competition regulator filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, alleging that it bought WhatsApp and Instagram, two social-media rivals, to suppress competition. Separately, a coalition of 46 American states, led by New York, launched a similar lawsuit against the company. Facebook argues that the legal actions are an attempt to revise history, as the takeovers were scrutinised and approved by regulators at the time.
Uber decided to sell its autonomous-vehicles subsidiary to Aurora, a startup that counts Amazon among its backers. Uber spent billions on selfdriving cars, which it can no longer afford as the pandemic eats into its ride-hailing business (it is also selling its flyingcar division, Uber Elevate, to a separate startup). The project unnerved investors in 2018 when one of its cars killed a woman in Arizona, the first fatal collision involving an autonomous car and a pedestrian. Uber is not getting out of the business entirely. It will take a stake in Aurora and may eventually integrate the technology with its platform.
Back in the sky
The first commercial flight of a Boeing 737 max took place, 20 months after the fleet was grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes. Gol airline flew passengers from Säo Paulo to Porto Alegre after its pilots completed training to fly the revamped jet, which has been certified as safe in Brazil and the United States. Meanwhile, Boeing delivered its first 737 max aircraft since the ban was lifted, to United Airlines, which will test the plane before entering it into service.
Huge investor appetite for the stockmarket debut of DoorDash, America's leading mealdelivery app, pushed its share price up by 86% on the first day of trading, valuing it at $6obn.

jd Health's ipo was also a success. The health-care division of jD.com, one of China's big e-commerce companies, raised $3.5bn in Hong Kong, in the biggest flotation of shares on the city's stockmarket this year.
China's exports grew by 21% in dollar terms in November over the same month last year, the fastest pace since February 2018. Much of that came from exports to the United States, which rose by half, despite the stiff tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the countries' trade war.
Meanwhile, China's official consumer price index fell by 0.5% in November from a year earlier, the country's first month of deflation since October 2009. A drop in food prices, notably in pork, as pig stocks improved after a bout of swine fever, lay behind the fall.

Ivan Glasenberg decided to retire as chief executive of Glencore, a job he has held for almost 20 years. Under his leadership Glencore became a global powerhouse in commodities, expanding from trading into mining. Mr Glasenberg's replacement when he steps down next year will be Gary Nagle, who runs Glencore's coal business. He has been tasked with a new company plan to cut its emissions by 40% over the next 15 years.

In what is thought to be the most lucrative deal for a single artist's publishing rights, Bob Dylan sold the copyright for more than 600 songs to Universal Music. The price was not revealed, but the troubadour and winner of a Nobel prize in literature is said to have wrung $300m from Universal, certainly no simple twist of fate.

Catalogues in general are heading for the checkout. Argos, a British retailer, will stop printing its in January. A family staple at Christmas, the Argos catalogue was once Europe's most widely printed publication, vying with the Bible for the title of most-read book in Britain.

Economists love to disagree, but almost all of them will tell you that inflation is dead. The premise of low inflation is baked into economic policies and financial markets. It is why central banks can cut interest rates to around zero and buy up mountains of government bonds. It explains how governments have been able to go on an epic spending and borrowing binge in order to save the economy from the ravages of the pandemic- and why rich-world public debt of 125% of gdp barely raises an eyebrow. The search for yield has propelled the s&p 500 index of shares to new highs even as the number of Americans in hospital with covid-19 has surpassed 100,000. The only way to justify such a blistering-hot stockmarket is if you expect a strong but inflationless economic rebound in 2021and beyond.
Yet as we explain this week (see Briefing), an increasingly vocal band of dissenters thinks that the world could emerge from the pandemic into an era of higher inflation. Their arguments are hardly overwhelming, but neither are they empty. Even a small probability of having to deal with a surge in inflation is worrying, because the stock of debt is so large and central-bank balance-sheets are swollen. Rather than ignore the risk, governments should take action now to insure themselves against it.
In the decades since Margaret Thatcher warned of a vicious cycle of prices and wages that threatened to ""destroy"" society, the rich world has come to take low inflation for granted. Before the pandemic even an ultratight jobs market could not jolt prices upwards, and now armies of people are unemployed. Many economists think the West, and especially the euro zone, is heading the way of Japan, which fell into deflation in the 1990s and has since struggled to lift price rises far above zero.
Predicting the end of this trend is a kind of apostasy. After the financial crisis some hawks warned that bond buying by central banks (known as quantitative easing, or qe) would reignite inflation. They ended up looking silly.
Today the inflationistas' arguments are stronger. One risk is of a temporary burst of inflation next year. In contrast to the period after the financial crisis, broad measures of the rich-world money supply have shot up in 2020, because banks have been lending freely. Stuck at home, people have been unable to spend all their money and their bank-balances have swelled. But once they are vaccinated and liberated from the tyranny of Zoom, exuberant consumers may go on a spending spree that outpaces the ability of firms to restore and expand their capacity, causing prices to rise. The global economy already shows signs of suffering from bottlenecks. The price of copper, for example, is 25% higher than at the start of 2020.
The world should be able to manage such a temporary burst of inflation. But the second inflationista argument is that more persistent price pressures will also emerge, as structural disinflationary forces go into reverse. In the West and in Asia many societies are ageing, creating shortages of workers. For years globalisation lowered inflation by creating a more efficient market for goods and labour. Now globalisation is in retreat.
Their third argument is that politicians and officials are complacent. The Federal Reserve says it wants inflation to overshoot its 2% target to make up for lost ground; the European Central Bank, which was expected to announce more stimulus after we went to press, may yet follow suit. Weighed down by the need to pay for an ageing population and health care, politicians will increasingly favour big budget deficits.
Might these arguments prove correct? A temporary rebound in inflation next year is perfectly possible. At first it would be welcome-a sign economies were recovering from the pandemic. It would inflate away a modest amount of debt. Policymakers might even breathe a sigh of relief, especially in Japan and the euro zone, where prices are falling (though rapid changes in the pattern of consumer spending may have muddied the statistics).
The odds of a more sustained period of inflation remain low. But if central banks had to raise interest rates to stop price rises getting out of hand, the consequences would be serious. Markets would tumble and indebted firms would falter. More important, the full cost of the state's vastly expanded balance-sheet-both governments' debt and the central banks' liabilities-would become alarmingly apparent. To understand why requires peering, for a moment, into how they are organised.
For all the talk about ""locking in"" today's low long-term interest rates, governments' dirty secret is that they have been doing the opposite, issuing short-term debt in a bet that short-term interest rates will remain low. The average maturity of American Treasuries, for example, has fallen from 70 months to 63. Central banks have been making a similar wager. Because the reserves they create to buy bonds carry a floating interest rate, they are comparable to short-term borrowing. In November Britain's fiscal watchdog warned that a combination of new issuance and qe had left the state's debt-service costs twice as sensitive to short-term rates as they were at the start of the year, and nearly three times as much as in 2012.
So while the probability of an inflation scare may have risen only slightly, its consequences would be worse. Countries need to insure themselves against this tail risk by reorganising their liabilities. Governments should fund fiscal stimulus by issuing long-term debt. Most central banks should start an orderly reversal of qe and instead loosen monetary policy by taking shortterm interest rates negative. Finance ministries should incorporate risks taken by the central bank into their budgeting (and the euro zone should find a better tool than qe for mutualising the debts of its member states). Shortening the maturity of the state's balance-sheet-as in 2020-must only ever be a last resort, and should not become the main tool of economic policy.
In praise of mothballs
The chances are the inflationistas are wrong. Even the archmonetarist Milton Friedman, who inspired Thatcher, admitted late in his life that the short-term link between the money supply and inflation had broken down. But the covid-19 pandemic has shown the value of preparing for rare but devastating events. The return of inflation should be no exception. *"

Why raising equity is back in fashion
For over a decade many people in finance have worried about the decline of the public company. Big firms were shrinking their capital bases by buying back shares. And fast-growing firms, including several hundred tech ""unicorns""-startups worth over $ibn-chose to remain in private hands rather than bother with an initial public offering (ipo). The result was riskier corporate balance-sheets and the exclusion of ordinary investors from the ownership of the economy's most exciting firms.
This year has seen a reversal of this trend with an equity-raising bonanza (see Business section). In the past few days Tesla has said it will sell $5bn of new shares, while DoorDash, a food-delivery company, raised $3.4bn in an ipo. In Hong Kong shares of jd Health, a digital-medicine star, rose by over 50% on their first day of trading after its $3.5bn ipo. As we went to press Airbnb, one of the largest unicorns, was listing at a valuation of over $40bn. Worldwide, some $8oobn of equity has been raised in 2020 by non-financial firms, the highest sum on record. In America in the last quarter the proceeds should roughly match the amount of shares that companies have bought back.
Equity is more expensive than borrowing, but has attractions. It is permanent capital that does not need to be repaid. And because it does not come with interest payments it is flexible, mak- ing firms more resilient. It is back in fashion for several reasons. Some firms need to repair the damage from the pandemic, for example Rolls-Royce, an aircraft-engine maker, and Carnival Cruises. The tech boom means unicorns can go public at skyhigh valuations. Frothy share prices allow the founders of firms that are already listed to raise capital without diluting their own stake by as much-something Tesla's Elon Musk has spotted.
There are other factors, too. More Chinese firms are coming of age. This year Nongfu Spring, China's answer to Evian, floated, making its founder the country's richest man. Investors are experimenting with legal structures that they think are more efficient than ipos, including spacs (special purpose acquisition companies). Finally, because covid-19 has led many firms to cut their buybacks there is less equity being retired than normal.
Investors are euphoric but they face several risks. One is that prices are too high. Another is that it is not yet clear whether overall corporate indebtedness will fall, partly because the damage from lockdowns is still mounting. For non-financial companies in America's s&p 500 index, net debt (debt less cash), dropped only slightly in the third quarter of this year, and remains above its level in 2019. Some firms are still burning cash and perhaps a fifth of s&p 500 firms are overborrowed. As the pandemic abates, firms may reinstate buybacks and dividends.
The last danger stems from a cohort of firms having too much cash. In the 1970s Michael Jensen, a scholar, argued that debt forced discipline on managers. His ideas were taken too far by Wall Street's junk-bond salesmen, but the risk of executives wasting cash on deals or vanity projects is real. The five biggest tech firms have over $550bn sitting around. They might try big takeovers-think of Apple buying Netflix. Meanwhile, some newly listed firms have oodles of cash, but give outside investors only limited voting power, making managers unaccountable.
Governments should welcome the equity boom. For years libertarians have argued that the only way to revive ipos is by watering down corporate-governance rules. They have been proved wrong. Many politicians long to ban buybacks, which they accuse of all sorts of evils (in fact they are similar to dividends but more flexible, which came in handy this year). If politicians really want to sustain healthy equity markets, they should instead reform tax codes, which almost everywhere favour debt by making interest costs tax-deductible. Removing the tax break for debt and putting equity on a level playing field should be the priority. It has the added advantage that the proceeds should help governments repay their own colossal debts. *"

If a last-minute trade deal is done, it will be thin-yet even that would be better than no deal
With the Brexit trade talks deadlocked-again-Boris Johnson flew to Brussels on December 9th to meet Ursula von der Leyen. By having a fish dinner with the European Commission's president, the prime minister hoped to replicate the lastminute deal that he struck in the Brexit withdrawal treaty in the autumn of 2019 after he went for a walk in Cheshire with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar. This time it seems not to have worked. As we went to press, the two had agreed that negotiations should continue until Sunday, but the dinner failed appreciably to narrow any of the big gaps remaining.
Contrary to many reports, the most intractable of these is not over access to British fishing waters. For both sides, fisheries are politically important but economically insignificant, which should make a compromise feasible. The biggest difficulty concerns the so-called level playing field. This is the label for the European Union's longstanding worry that post-Brexit Britain may undercut the social, labour, environmental and state-subsidy rules that underpin its single market. The eu's wish to be allowed to retaliate promptly if this happens runs slap against Mr Johnson's claim that Brexit must mean unfettered sovereignty and an absolute right to diverge from regulations that are set in Brussels. If no compromise proves possible on the level playing field, the outcome is likely to be that there will be no trade deal in place when the transition period comes to an end on December 31st.
The deal or no-deal argument skates over an important fact: that even agreement would represent a hard Brexit. Avoiding tariffs and quotas on goods is certainly desirable, but it still entails leaving the single market that Margaret Thatcher did so much to create. The deal does nothing for services, which make up 80% of the economy. The eu is withholding decisions to grant Britain the necessary equivalence for its financial regulation or to rule its data protection adequate so as to permit data transfers. Being out of the customs union implies not just more bureaucracy and customs controls but also checks on rules of origin for exports. A trade deal that erects rather than pulls down barriers is an unusual beast. Industries ranging from broadcasting to chemicals (see Britain section) will suffer from being under a different regulatory regime and losing hitherto frictionless trade.
Then there is Northern Ireland. Under the withdrawal treaty, the province will stay in the single market and customs union in order to avert the risk of a hard border with the Irish Republic. But this necessitates checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. It is welcome that, after reaching agreement with the eu this week on how these checks should be done, the government has abandoned its earlier plans unilaterally (and illegally) to rewrite the Northern Irish provisions of the withdrawal treaty. But treating the province, which voted to remain in the eu, differently from Great Britain inevitably raises questions about the future of the United Kingdom. Equally, the demand for a second independence referendum is rising in Scotland, which also voted to remain.
Yet even a thin deal would be better than no deal at all. The economic differences between the two count for something. Modelling by the independent Office of Budget Responsibility finds that a deal would make gdp some 4% lower than it otherwise would be: no deal would add a further 2 percentage point cut on top. Then there are the politics. Whereas a deal would create a base on which Britain could build other agreements with its largest and most important neighbour, the acrimonious blame game that would follow a failure in the talks would poison relations for years. Not reaching a deal would complicate co-operation on such matters as domestic security, intelligence-sharing and foreign policy. And it would stand as a globally reputation-shredding failure of statecraft by both sides. As he returns home from his Brussels dinner, Mr Johnson should reflect on what a poor outcome that would be. *"

Other rich countries should learn from the Keira Bell case in England
What should you do if a 12-year-old girl says: ""I am a boy""? If the answer were simple or obvious, the question would not be so explosively controversial. A good place to start, if you are a parent, is to affirm that you love the child. It should go without saying, too, that no child should be bound by gender stereotypes. Boys can wear dresses; girls can play with cars, or become plumbers. The question gets much harder, however, when children say they hate their body and want a different one. Gender dysphoria (a feeling of alienation from one's natal sex) is real, and the proportion of children and adolescents diagnosed with it in rich countries is rising for reasons that are poorly understood (see International section). One school of thought, which has spread rapidly, is that you should agree with youngsters who identify as transgender, and offer them medical interventions, if they ask for them, to help their bodies match what they regard as their true selves.
England's high court last week highlighted some of the problems that can flow from such thinking. The case concerned Keira Bell, who says she was rushed into life-changing medical treatment when she was 16, which she now regrets. The process began with drugs that delay puberty. These are typically described as reversible and a way to ""buy time"". But at the Tavistock clinic, where Ms Bell was treated, most patients who took puberty blockers went on also to take cross-sex hormones (oestrogen for males who want to grow breasts; testosterone for females who want to develop male sexual characteristics). Many then proceeded to surgery.
Some of the effects of this are irreversible. Skipping puberty causes sterility. Ms Bell's breasts, which were removed when she was 20, will not grow back. Those who undergo gender-reassignment treatment may never be able to have children of their own, or experience an orgasm; and the evidence of long-term benefits is extremely sketchy. The English court said it was highly unlikely that someone of 15 could understand all this well enough to give informed consent to taking puberty blockers, which it called an experimental treatment. It suggested that in the case of 16- or 17-year-olds, it might be wise for doctors to seek a court's permission before prescribing such drugs. Once they reach adulthood, young people in England and Wales are free to seek whatever hormones or surgery they choose.
Many trans activists denounced the ruling as a travesty, or even a denial of the right of trans people to exist. Their passion is understandable. Trans people have often been appallingly treated, and it is right that societies should pass laws to protect them from discrimination, and from bullying in schools. But given the available evidence, the ruling is a reasonable attempt to set out guidelines in an area where there are as yet no good solutions. Other countries should learn from it.
Some children and adolescents who express gender dysphoria will never be happy with their natal sex. But studies suggest that 61-98% of children with gender-related distress, if allowed to go through puberty without medical intervention, will be reconciled to it. Many will realise that they are simply gay. Alas, there is as yet no way to predict these outcomes. So the possible harm of delaying transition for those who might benefit from it must be weighed against harm to the health and the emotional lives of a larger number of people. The latter harm appears worse, so the English court was right to err on the side of preventing it.
It was also right to criticise the Tavistock for several failures. The clinic could not say how many of those referred for puberty blockers had autism, which is common among those who express gender dysphoria. It did not have good data on how many move on to cross-sex hormones. Nor did it properly lay out for patients the alternatives to medical intervention.
Perhaps clinics in other rich countries do a better job of caring for the children and adolescents that attend them. But since they are often subject to less scrutiny, it would be unwise to assume so. The number of transgender clinics has shot up in several countries. In America it has risen from one to more than 50 since 2007-there are no national statistics on how many patients seek treatment. And some activists are urging rules which, though no doubt well-meaning, would make it harder to strike the right balance when treating gender dysphoric children.
Some Australian and American states have banned ""conversion therapy"" in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity; Canada is considering doing likewise. This conflates two issues which are not the same. It is wrong to try to talk gay people into being straight. But the same principles applied to gender identity could criminalise counselling that raises the distinct possibility that a particular trans-identifying child or adolescent might one day desist. So such laws are a bad idea. Youngsters who are trying to grapple with gender dysphoria need honest, caring therapy that sets out all the long-term options. Health services must do a better job of providing it. And before embracing invasive procedures such as those undergone by Ms Bell, the medical profession needs to gather evidence to establish the balance of benefits and harm they bring. *"

You reported that a lack of data on race hampers efforts to tackle inequalities, and exhorted governments to ensure that they start to gather this vital information (""Wanted: more data"", November 21st). This message also needs to be heard by researchers. The over- or under-sampling of ethnic and social groups in research is skewing our understanding of human behaviour and disease. As of 2018, individuals included in the vital studies defining the genetic causes of diseases were 78% European, 10% Asian, 2% African, 1% Hispanic, and less than 1% for all other ethnic groups. A report in Science suggested that Western bias in human genetic studies is ""both scientifically damaging and unfair"". In the field of psychology, the problem is so great-96% of data comes from 12% of the world's citizens- that the over-sampled privileged population has its own acronym, weird (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic). This weird population has been shown across a number of traits to be poorly representative of the wider population.

Borders melt away
One important thing to note about the Spanish region of Galicia is that things began to improve when Spain joined the European Union and the border with Portugal disappeared (""Us Gallegos"", November 7th). The combined Spanish and Portuguese area in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula has 12.5m people. Money from Europe helped build a motorway between Vigo and Porto. Thanks to the eu, we are now more open to international trade than most Spanish regions, and our economy is growing fast. In Galicia, at least on the economic front, our relationship with Portugal is as important as it is with Madrid. Our languages are similar, which helps us communicate with 300m Portuguese speakers around the world.

The economics of a disease
Although epidemiologists may have sometimes failed to see how social behaviour influences the spread of a disease (Free exchange, November 14th), economists have often been slow to recognise how the social changes generated by the threat of a disease affects the economy. This is the second time this century that economists have failed miserably to anticipate how an epidemic can be as much an economic crisis as it is a public-health one, and to anticipate how deep it would be once it did emerge.
You said, rightly, that economics shows very little interest in crossing disciplines. More worrying is the insistence of economists to rely on a limited set of methods that, although rigorous, prevent us from investigating catastrophic risks. George Akerlof recently criticised the ""hard"" methods that are preferred in economics.

Your column claimed that economists like me and epidemiologists ""got off on the wrong foot"" during the pandemic. The views you attributed to ""economists"" are those of a small but loud minority. Most economists I know value the work of epidemiologists and try to learn from them as much as possible. They do not ""intensely criticise"" epidemiologists' models or their use. Instead they have benefited greatly from them and been very much aware of how difficult it is to forecast an epidemic in the face of limited and fast-changing data availability and quality. They also try to collaborate with, and get feedback from, epidemiologists and public-health researchers.

After the Dayton peace deal
""Dayton at 25"" (November 21st) depicted Bosnia correctly in several aspects. When I started visiting the country 12 years ago, I was surprised to still see divisions among its people. The war heroes on monuments in one place would be considered war criminals just a few kilometres away. Car plates bear no indication of the region of registration, probably to prevent trouble. Yet some of the problems you pointed out are not necessarily attributable to the current state structure: mass emigration, poverty and bad public services can be found in several ethnically homogenous countries. As regards Milorad Dodik, he may well talk ""of independence and integration with Serbia"", but he will not follow this up with action. Any new armed confrontation is close to impossible. Over time, the present differences will soften. In the future, Dayton at 50 might be a rare example of a successful case in state building.

The corporate jungle
Writing about the change in leadership at McDonald's, Schumpeter mused on new bosses who are ""overeager to tear up the legacy of their disgraced predecessors"" (November 14th). This is what I call the Simba Syndrome. Many new executives follow the model of the lion pride, formed by a dominant male, several lionesses and their cubs. When a new male takes over by chasing off or killing the previous king he then kills off the previous male's cubs. This also happens in companies, where projects and sometimes people linked with the previous boss are ""killed off"" by the successor upon taking over.

What Abraham said
Your lovely obituary of Rabbi Lord Sacks (November 21st) mentioned that ""Abraham, ordered to sacrifice his son Isaac, had said three times to God, 'Hineni', 'Here I am.'"" In fact, Abraham says Hineni to God only once in that episode, once more to God's messenger (or ""angel""), and once to Isaac himself. The story is about Abraham's fidelity and availability to God, surely; but by embedding the same word in Abraham's response to his son, the story itself presents the tension between our obligations to the divine and our obligations to our fellow humans. It does not try to obscure those tensions, but confronts the reader frankly with them.
I met Rabbi Sacks only once, and very briefly. But from that encounter, I suspect that he would be delighted that the obituary's small slip gives us an opportunity to contemplate some of the fundamental dynamics he had dedicated his life to communicating.

In 1975 Adam Fergusson, a journalist on the Times, published a book called ""When Money Dies"". A history of hyperinflation in Germany in the early 1920s, it was written with an eye to what was going on in the then-present day. Inflation in Britain was not at the prices-soaring-day-by-day levels seen in the Weimar Republic. But in 1975 it reached an unprecedented 24%-grim enough for Fergusson's warning that the experience of inflation was ""totally absorbing, demanding complete attention while it lasts"" to hit home.
Rapid, continuous increases in prices arbitrarily take wealth away from savers and devalue people's wages. It is not just the purchasing power of a unit of currency that is eroded; it is the trust in a reliable future on which contracts and capitalism depend. From the early 1970s to the 1980s more than 50% of Americans said ""inflation or the high cost of living"" was the single biggest problem facing the country.
But by the 1990s the beast seemed to be vanquished. Average rates dropped; so did the number of ""inflation surprises"" in which the rate spikes (see chart 1 on next page). When ""The West Wing"", a television show, gave its fictional president a ""secret plan to fight inflation"" in 1999 it was as a joke, not a plot point. True to Mr Fergusson's belief that the experience of living with inflation is ""forgotten or ignorable when it has gone"", his book fell out of print.
It was republished to acclaim at the end of the 2000s, when post-financial-crisis stimulus packages increased government debt prodigiously, and ""quantitative easing"", the process by which trillions of new dollars would be created, started to hit its stride. Many worried that the stage seemed set for prices to surge in a way which had not been seen for a generation.
They did not. Over the 1970s rich-world inflation averaged 10% a year. In the 2010s the rate stayed stubbornly below 2% a year. That is one of the reasons that the small but vocal band of economists and investors that is once again worried about excessive price rises is by and large being ignored. The agenda for a big conference on central banking to be held in February has copious space for financial instability, climate change and inequality but barely any for inflation-despite taking place in Germany, a country which, since Weimar, has all but fetishised sound money.
Indeed a modest rise in inflation, rather than giving central bankers the vapours, would have them sighing with relief. In recent years, and most dramatically during the worst of the crisis this spring, the threat of demand-sapping deflation loomed large, especially in the euro area and Japan. Some want central banks to aim for inflation higher than the 2% target that most of them use, and America's Federal Reserve has already said that it wants to overshoot its 2% target in the recovery to make up for recent shortfalls. Recent experience suggests that may be hard: interest rates close to zero have left monetary policy hard-put to push inflation back up even to 2%.
Look behind you
But if it is easy to ignore the prophets of doom, it may not be wise. If 2020 has a lesson, it is that problems which many in the world had broadly stopped worrying about can rear up with sudden and terrible force. And those sounding the alarm today are right to point out that the circumstances of the covid pandemic do not offer a simple re-run of 2009's false alarm.
Some of today's inflationistas predict a 1 possibly high but transitory spike in prices as consumer spending bounces back from the pandemic. On December 3rd Bill Dudley, who was until 2018 a vice-chairman of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee, warned Bloomberg readers that sharp price increases might be necessary ""to balance demand with the available supply, which the pandemic has undoubtedly diminished."" The next day David Andolfatto, an economist at the St Louis Fed, warned Americans to ""prepare themselves for a temporary burst of inflation.""
Others warn of more persistent inflationary pressure. Economists at Morgan Stanley, a bank, predict ""a fundamental shift in inflation dynamics"" in America, with inflation rising to the Fed's 2% target by the second half of 2021 and going on to overshoot it. After a typical recession such a rebound takes three years or more. The most pessimistic group warns that complacent or distracted central bankers will allow such pressures to go unchecked, leading to a decade of stubbornly high inflation comparable to the 1970s.
Three main factors are deemed to be at play: the after-effects of the stimulus measures taken by governments to cope with the pandemic; demographic shifts; and changes in policymakers' attitudes towards the economy.
Take the stimulus packages first. Monetarism, which was the dominant economic ideology over the period in the 1980s during which inflation was squeezed out of rich-world economies, sees the root cause of inflation as an excessive supply of money. On that basis the fact that nearly a fifth of all the dollars in existence have been created this year clearly looks perturbing. Central-bank balance sheets in America, Britain, Japan and the euro zone have risen by more than 20% of their combined gdp since the crisis began, mostly to buy government debt. This new money is paying for enormous stimulus programmes, including wage subsidies, furlough schemes and expanded welfare benefits that put money in pockets and purses.
This money creation differs from the burst seen after the financial crisis-the burst which, despite warnings, triggered no surge in inflation. That earlier burst began during a prolonged credit crunch. This meant that the new money created by central banks was making up for money that was not being created by bank lending.
This time it is not just ""base money""- physical cash and electronic reserves the quantity of which is under central-bank control-which has soared. Measures of ""broad money"", which includes households' bank balances, have, too. Lending to the private sector has risen sharply as firms have borrowed cash to continue operations. After 2009 the broad-money supply rose slowly; today it is spiking (see chart 2).
The private sector will thus find itself flush with cash as vaccinated economies reopen. Households and firms may remain cautious, sitting on their accumulated savings. But amid the joy of reopening they may instead go on a spending spree, making up for all the time not spent in theatres, restaurants and bars during 2020. That would result in a lot of money chasing goods and services that might not be in ample supply, resulting in a period of inflation that would tail off as the purchasing power of the money involved fell, bringing things back towards the status quo.
From the Black Death on
Researchers from the Bank of England who looked at 800 years of (admittedly patchy) records have concluded that inflation does typically rise in the year after a pandemic begins. A recent paper by Robert Barro of Harvard University and colleagues finds that the influenza pandemic of 1918-20 ""increased inflation rates at least temporarily"". By the time the effects of the covid-19 pandemic are fully on the wane more firms will have joined the ranks of those which have already gone under and many of the survivors will be struggling to run at full tilt. Thus people's willingness to spend could easily rebound faster than their opportunities to do so. There is already some evidence of bottlenecks where supply is falling behind demand. The price of shipping an object from one country to another has jumped in recent weeks, while the price of iron ore has risen by more than 60% since the beginning of the year.
This is the risk of which Mr Dudley warns. In the aggregate, though, investors seem unconvinced. The inflation expectations which can be derived from prices in financial markets have recently picked up a little thanks to the good news on vaccines and the prospects for a rebound in the world economy. But they still suggest that investors think next year's inflation is more likely to be below the 2% central banks target than above it (see chart 3 on next page). Lars Christensen, a Danish economist, points out that this means there is a ""clash"" between the two bestknown economic theories associated with the Chicago school. Milton Friedman said sustained growth in the money supply leads to inflation; Eugene Fama argued that market prices fully reflect all available information. ""If you believe that we are going to have inflation now...the efficient-markets hypothesis would have to be wrong,"" Mr Christensen argues.
Most economists side with the markets and Mr Fama. In general they no longer think about inflation as 1980s monetarists did (indeed even Friedman, late in life, admitted that modern central banking might have severed the link between the money supply and prices). Following the ""New Keynesian"" framework of the 1990s they believe that the underlying driver of inflation is a combination of the public's expectations of price rises, which are self-fulfilling, and the health of the labour market. Both currently point to low inflation.
Neither survey data nor the financial markets suggest that the public expects dramatic price rises. And most forecasts suggest it will take some time for employment to find its pre-pandemic level, even in the economies which bounce back most quickly. Goldman Sachs, a bank which has been especially bullish about the prospects for the American economy, does not expect the unemployment rate to fall below 4% until 2024. And America's economy is expected to recover faster than most. Relatively high unemployment-in the jargon, an ""output gap""-will give firms little incentive to increase people's wages, and thus little need to raise prices. A ""projected large output gap should push global core inflation 0.5% percentage points below its pre-crisis levels next year"", argue economists at JPMorgan Chase, another bank.
So even if there is a spending boom, there will be plenty of economic slack around to accommodate it. Some economists bridge the two views, predicting that the economy will get back to speed in fits and starts, some perhaps inflationary. But for most, high joblessness and contained inflation expectations make forecasting continued low inflation a no-brainer.
What, though, if the New Keynesian view is missing key parts of the story? In ""The Great Demographic Reversal"", published last summer, Charles Goodhart, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary-policy committee, and Manoj Pradhan of Talking Heads Macro, a research firm, provide an alternative view of the past decades' low inflation. It was not, they say, the result of a correct diagnosis of the problem leading, in the hands of independent central bankers, to appropriate monetary policy. Rather, it was driven by global demography.
In recent decades the integration of China, Europe's formerly communist east and other emerging markets into the global trading system provided the world economy with millions of new workers. As bosses found it ever easier to get their labour done in Guangdong or Bratislava the bargaining power of rich-country workers fell, and price rises to cover increased wages became a thing of the past. This fits the finding that much more of the low inflation seen in recent decades has come from stable or falling prices for goods that can have their site of production shifted than has come from services which have to be delivered in situ.
Things are now about to change, the authors claim. As populations in the rich world and China age, the number of dependents per worker will soar, creating a labour shortage in care industries. True, Africa and India have plenty of youngsters. But rich-world politics may further increase the barriers to their migration. Workers in the rich world will thus acquire more bargaining power; wages will rise and prices will rise accordingly. As well as reigniting inflation, these demographic forces will make Western countries more equal, Mr Goodhart and Mr Pradhan argue: another seemingly inexorable trend reversed.
It might seem that the recent experience of Japan, the rich country that has aged the most, puts paid to this idea. Inflation there has long been lower than anywhere else, despite Herculean efforts on the part of the Bank of Japan. Mr Goodhart and Mr Pradhan counter this argument by saying that a ""global escape valve"" stopped inflationary pressures in Japan from achieving much. Rather than stagnate, investment moved overseas as Japanese manufacturing firms took advantage of plentiful global labour. Cheap imports kept goods inflation down and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs reduced workers' bargaining power.
In fact, though, wage growth in Japan's manufacturing industries has been comparatively strong. What is more, the authors concede that Japan's ageing population has not had quite the effect on the dependency ratio that might be expected- because many more elderly people are now working. The same phenomenon could yet contain inflation elsewhere.
The third argument for fearing a return of inflation is political. It rests on the idea that governments and central banks are becoming more tolerant of inflation, and that they will become even more so as the extent of the pressure on government budgets becomes apparent.
Back in the 1970s presidents and prime ministers were happy to strong-arm central bankers into doing what they wanted. Inflation was tamed only after Paul Volcker proved the Fed's commitment and independence by pushing America into recession to slow price rises. A new paper by Jonathon Hazell of Princeton University and colleagues argues that post-Volcker ""shifts in beliefs about the long-run monetary regime"" have proved more important than any other factor in conquering inflation. Their actions in recent decades have built up a firm expectation that central banks will respond to the prospect of inflation rising above its target with higher interest rates, regardless of what politicians and the public might want.
It is possible that these norms are weakening. In recent years there have already been greater attacks on the independence of central banks, such as President Donald Trump's exhortations that interest rates should stay low. And during the pandemic the relationship between central banks and finance ministries has grown unusually close. After it ends, politicians will face the problem of the debts left behind. Where those debts are long-term, inflation would be a handy way to reduce their real value, easing the strain on budgets. Politicians may be more willing to entertain such an option for the reason identified by Mr Fergusson-that, after a long period of low inflation, people forget how awful it can be. A third of the people currently living in the rich world had not been born when average inflation last exceeded 5%.
Doubting the future
The Fed's commitment to deliberately allow inflation to exceed 2% during the recovery is Exhibit A for this belief. Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank (ecb), emphasises her mandate is to ""support the general economic policies"" of the eu, as well as ensure stable prices. Central bankers everywhere now admit, if only under their breath, that as well as maintaining price stability they are also trying to keep governments' longterm-borrowing costs low in order to facilitate fiscal stimulus. Should inflationary pressure start to rise while they are doing so, will they abandon that effort? Central banks which put up borrowing rates under the current circumstances would undoubtedly face opposition from the finance ministries that would pay the increased costs and suffer in subsequent elections. Inflationistas think that the politicians would win, as in many cases they constitutionally should. Central bankers' independence is granted by elected politicians.
But this political argument, too, has its weaknesses. The ecb's independence is protected by treaty, and even though it has become more willing to stimulate in recent years, it still exhibits a hawkish bias, tolerating inflation expectations that are well below target. Elderly people like to vote and tend to dislike inflation, argues Vitor Gaspar of the International Monetary Fund. That should limit any political pressure for higher inflation in ageing societies.
The doves and the markets currently have the better of the argument. But the case for reflation in the world economy is stronger than it was after the global financial crisis. A recovery from the pandemic that is untroubled by excessive inflation looks likely. But it is not guaranteed. *"

SHERBURNIN ELMET
What the chemicals industry reveals about leaving the European Union
Andrew clarke closely guards his recipe for yolk-coloured ink, known in the trade as a yellow 13. But the process is simple enough. Powdery pigment is mixed with solvent, varnish and thickener, many of the supplies imported from abroad, and then milled between steel rollers into a glossy syrup. His factory in Yorkshire specialises in bespoke orders for coatings used to make food cartons, magazines and circuit boards. His small laboratory is lined with pots of resins and wetting agents, and machines that measure the fineness and viscosity of his creations.
Brexit, which comes into full effect on January 1st, worries Mr Clarke. The European chemicals market is fragmenting. He fears the substances that give his coatings their distinctive qualities may slowly disappear from sale in Britain, leaving him reliant on inferior substitutes. ""If we are trying to sell to Europe, we might be offering our best stuff, but an eu competitor could come in using the state-of-the-art raw material, which in our customers' eyes is significantly better,"" he says.
The future of the British chemicals industry is Brexit in microcosm. Boris Johnson wants a trade deal that eliminates all tariffs on goods, including chemicals. Yet even if he gets this, it will do little to soothe the headaches that arise from leaving the single market. A project that promised to throw off the eu's system of regulation will instead replicate it in miniature, creating a Brussels-on-Thames. Chemical firms, foreign airlines, lawyers and internet companies-all will face new burdens if they wish to keep doing business in Britain.
At root is a grand misunderstanding. Brexiteers often think of the eu's single market as a mere rule book. Thus, they suggest, Britain simply needs to copy those rules into domestic law, and then tweak them at leisure. But the single market is better thought of as an ecosystem: an elaborate regime of registration, surveillance and enforcement. Goods and services percolate freely across national borders because governments can rely on Brussels to keep watch for unwanted adulterations.
Reach, the bit of the single market governing chemicals, is especially strict. Firms selling into Europe must submit lengthy dossiers detailing how their products were made, and appoint an agent on European soil, who can be collared if things go wrong. The system is overseen by the European Chemicals Agency (echa) in Helsinki, which has 600 staff and a budget of more than €ioom ($i2om). The enforcement is done by a network of national agencies, such as Britain's Health and Safety Executive (hse), based in Liverpool. The result is a free-flowing pool of 23,000 chemicals for Mr Clarke and his continental rivals to choose from, underpinned by a vast database of safety information which regulators can scour for risks.
Theresa May, Mr Johnson's predecessor, asked to stay in Reach, having been convinced there was little to gain from divergence. But this was rejected by the eu, who called it ""cherry-picking"". So Britain will try to replicate the regime at home, under the title of ""uk Reach"". The names of chemicals originally registered by British companies will be copied into domestic law. The hse will take on the echa's job, funded by fees on users. European companies will need a legal footprint to trade in Britain, and British companies vice versa.
The most difficult task will be replicating the echa's database. Ministers at first insisted they could simply copy-and-paste it. They could not: it is stuffed with commercially-sensitive intellectual property, and there is little incentive to give a departing state a leg-up. The eu has so far rebuffed Britain's request for a chemicals data-sharing clause in the trade deal.
Instead, the government will require Mr Clarke's suppliers to submit the data themselves. But many dossiers were produced by consortia of companies, and there is little reason for a French firm to bail out a British rival. basf, a big German chemicals firm, reckons registering with uk Reach will cost them £70m ($90m). Small British distributors whose continental suppliers file paperwork under the eu system may find themselves designated ""importers"". One boss calculates a bill of £1m in registration fees if he has to lodge all the substances he imports, on an annual turnover of £15m: ""We'd be bankrupt in a week.""
George Eustice, the environment secretary, now admits some firms may find the task ""both expensive and time-consuming"", and this summer delayed the timetable for lodging dossiers for some products from 2023 to 2027. But more time does not help much, says Peter Newport of the Chemicals Business Association. ""It's a change from a guillotined beheading to a death by a thousand cuts over a six-year timescale,"" he sighs.
There are two scenarios for how this will play out. One is that ministers push on with uk Reach, and substances are pulled from the British market as manufacturers conclude that registration costs make lowvolume products unviable. The so-called ""salt-and-pepper"" additives used in tiny quantities in paints are particularly vulnerable. The flow going the other way is already shrinking. Only 70% of the British firms that registered chemicals with the echa before Brexit have started transferring their dossiers to new legal entities in Europe, the regulator notes. ""We'll become very insular, and they'll become equally self-absorbed,"" says Mr Clarke. As a result, Britain would be a less attractive place to open an assembly line.
The second scenario is that uk Reach founders. The deadlines could be pushed back further, or the new rules left unenforced. With an empty database, says Michael Warhurst of chem Trust, an environmental charity, the regulator in Liverpool would be less able than the one in Helsinki to spot hazards, or to defend its decisions against deep-pocketed companies in court.
The promise of Brexit was that Britain would be the master of its own regulation, acting more nimbly or stringently than the eu if it wished. But the outcome Mr Warhurst fears would not be deregulation by design, but one forced upon ministers because their ambitions to match European standards have failed. A big market means Brussels can afford to be strict in its regulation. Britain will learn that it cannot. *"

An assertive new tech watchdog for post-Brexit Britain
December 8th was a big day for jabs in Britain. In Coventry, at the crack of dawn, Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive a proven covid-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, in London, the Competition and Markets Authority (cma) published the blueprint for a new regime of oversight of tech companies. Less momentous, it nonetheless provides a shot in the arm to Britain's post-Brexit regulatory reputation. ""Ground-breaking"" is how one competition lawyer describes it.
The idea of the new regime is something called ""ex ante"" regulation, which tells big companies how they should behave, rather than asking for remedies after they have misbehaved. The old approach works for slow-moving industries. But digital ones change too quickly for retroactive enforcement to do much good. To fix that, a new regulator, the Digital Markets Unit (dmu), will write and enforce the rules for tech. The government intends to get it up and running by April 2021, and has committed to making it a statutory body.
Most competition law applies to all firms, or is written for specific industries. The dmu will take this a step further, assigning certain companies ""strategic market status""-meaning they have ""entrenched market power""-and tailoring a bespoke code of conduct for that particular firm. Fines for failing to comply will reach 10% of global revenue. New rules will also come into place around mergers, allowing regulators to consider how a startup might develop, rather than looking only at its current market status. The current ""ex post"" regime means regulators sometimes have to try to fix problems years after harm is already done. On December 9th America's Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, alleging that it had ""targeted potential competitive threats to its dominance"", buying Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.
The significance of the cma's plan goes beyond its effect on technology companies. The cma is ""setting out its stall as a world leader in competition post-Brexit"", says Katherine Kirrage, a digital competition and regulatory lawyer at Osborne Clarke, a law firm. The publication of its proposals precede by a week new rules from the European Commission, which will probably be similar in spirit. The cma's powers to conduct market studies and investigations are a model for other regulators. And it will also play an important role in co-ordinating various British government policies, including a code of conduct for technology firms to prevent ""online harms"", and new rules around how social media and search engines interact with British journalism.
There are political considerations to all this. The government now has to enshrine the DMU's powers in law, but will want to ensure Britain remains an attractive place for big tech companies after Brexit. Tighten the rules too much and firms may flee to Dublin or Amsterdam; leave them too loose and it risks damaging relations with the eu. So far, Britain's plans are broadly in step with how Europe and other countries are thinking about competition in the tech sector, says Damian Tambini of the London School of Economics, and regulators have worked well together. That is an encouraging start. But it is unlikely to inoculate against other challenges to come."

Bureaucrats will topple more statues than crowds managed last summer
On december STB a small group of people carefully removed a sign marking Cassland Road Gardens in London and laid it on the ground. Thus was one corner of the capital purged of its association with an offensive historical figure-fohn Cass, an early-18th-century slave trader. It was a modest event, noticed by few, which suited the organisers. ""It makes more sense to do it this way,"" says Toyin Agbetu, a researcher and activist.
* The other way is more spectacular. Last June a Bristol crowd inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement pulled down a statue of Edward Colston, another slave trader, and rolled it into the harbour. In the same week activists in Glasgow erected alternative street signs, replacing tobacco barons with black heroes. Elsewhere, statues were daubed with paint. Vigilante groups- some polite and peaceful, others not-mobilised to defend cherished figures.
To cool things down, many local authorities promised to investigate monuments and street names. In theory, all 130 Labour-led councils are doing so, as are some controlled by the Scottish National Party. Hackney, which contains the currently nameless gardens formerly known as Cassland Road, has a rolling process: offensive things are removed when a group of councillors, historians and community leaders reach a consensus. But most councils commissioned reports, which are beginning to come in. This quieter process is likely to topple more statues and names than the crowds did.
Researchers at Lambeth Archives have found that in that London borough four street names, one ward and one tomb commemorate slave owners. Another seven things have some link to slavery or black oppression-for example, a memorial and a block of flats are named after a 17th-century director of the East India Company, which traded slaves at the time. Lambeth Archives uses a traffic-light system: red for definite links, orange for more tenuous ones, green for the blameless.
Some investigations have come up empty-handed. An independent review of statues in Bradford found none that is offensive. In Leeds, investigators found only one ""particularly negative"" image: an architectural frieze showing an African man in a loincloth. Both cities are far from the coast, and the investigators looked only at statues. Even so, the reports may affect the streetscape. They conclude that the cities should do a better job of reflecting their black, Asian and Jewish populations.
By far the most comprehensive report is the one commissioned by the Welsh government. It finds 68 monuments, places or streets with a definite connection to slavery or racism, and another 213 with a looser connection. One man, Thomas Picton, who governed Trinidad with a brutality that shocked his contemporaries and was later killed at the battle of Waterloo, has 19 roads definitely and 13 possibly named after him. He is also commemorated by a 25-metre obelisk and in the names of a sports centre, a community centre and two pubs.
The local councils that will decide the fate of most street names and monuments must mull tricky questions. If slave traders are anathema, what about people who opposed abolition? And how finicky do they want to be? For example, Swansea has a Grenfell Park Road. That seems to be named after Pascoe St Leger Grenfell, who was part-owner of a copper company that ran Cuban mines with slave labour. But a Grenfell Avenue on the other side of Swansea might have been named after David Grenfell, a Labour mp. It is not clear that many people appreciate the distinction.
The Conservative government is against removing statues, and hints that iconoclasm may lead to funding cuts. But big cities are not Tory territory; statues might become even more tempting targets if they are associated with the government. And the reports will create momentum. Gaynor Legall, who chaired the Welsh investigation, says she used to assume, naively, that slavery was mostly an English phenomenon. She hopes that her review will lead to a national reckoning. ""We can't just drop it now,"" she says. *"

Black Lives Matter has made a mark on Britain's grandest schools
Joseph spence is everything one might expect from the master of Dulwich College. His doctoral thesis delved into 19th-century Irish Toryism, and his cv is a tour of Britain's most illustrious schools. But he is no traditionalist. Under his leadership, Dulwich offers pupils unconscious bias training and a history curriculum which aims ""to amplify the voices of the colonised as much as the coloniser"". The hope, says Dr Spence, is to look beyond the conventional canon, although that ""doesn't mean it has to disappear"", he reassures.
Britain's public schools were once proud bastions of tradition-now they are trying to move with the times. Marlborough focuses on black history, filling its curriculum with ""as many diverse texts, guests and experiences as possible"". Harrow's summer reading list includes voguish titles like ""White Fragility"" by Robin DiAngelo. Eton faces criticism for sacking a teacher who made a video arguing against ""radical feminism"" (the school insists the problem was the refusal to take it off YouTube).
Some of this reflects the schools' intakes. More than a third of pupils at independent schools now come from ethnic minorities, up from a quarter a decade ago. Many are aware that they could be more welcoming. A survey by the African Caribbean Education Network, a group of black parents whose children attend private and grammar schools, found that 76% of their children have experienced racial bias.
Change is pushed by pupils. Following George Floyd's death in May, many petitioned for diverse curriculums. At Charterhouse, pupils formed the Unity Society, a safe space where they could discuss current affairs. Most teachers are happy to support these efforts, says Will Orr-Ewing of Keystone Tutors: ""These schools are run by liberals, for liberals.""
Opponents think schools are frightened of censure. A recently departed Eton teacher says the Charities Commission, which requires schools to prove they provide a public good to enjoy tax advantages, has had a significant impact on their behaviour, as has growing political opposition to their charitable status. According to the teacher: ""Suddenly every leading private school had an outreach officer whose job it was to say, 'Look how much we care, look how liberal and inclusive we are! Please like us! Please don't beat us up!'""
Parents are not entirely on board. When pupils at Benenden complained in October that their headmistress used a racial slur in a speech about diversity, parents backed the head. Yet even some sceptics may recognise the appeal. Top public schools offer good grades, and the opportunity to pick up knowledge that helps you get ahead in the world. Is knowing the lingo of much of society's elite part of that nowadays? ""You bet,"" affirms one head teacher."

Britain excels at announcing climate targets. It must do more to meet them
Britain is in danger of securing a reputation for too much style and too little substance when it comes to climate change. The government has spent the past few months issuing target after goal after grandiose statement, all intended to portray the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution as a leader on the path to global decarbonisation. But policies and funding to make the targets reality are lacking.
On December 3rd Boris Johnson announced that the country's greenhousegas emissions would, in the coming decade, drop to 68% below where they stood in 1990-a considerable decrease on the previous goal of a 57% drop by 2030. The pledge will form part of Britain's formal amped-up contribution to the un Paris agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, all countries are due to submit fresh commitments by the end of 2020. Scores of new pledges are thus expected at a virtual summit on December 12th, held to mark five years since the agreement was made on the outskirts of France's capital.
On December 9th the Committee on Climate Change (ccc), which advises the government, presented a breakdown of how the economy, landscape and society must change over the coming decades to meet Britain's long-term goal of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. It says emissions should decline rapidly between 2025 and 2035, by which date they should be 78% below levels in 1990.
Some of the biggest gains are forecast to come from ditching the combustion engine in favour of electric vehicles, as well as a vast but currently non-existent programme to replace gas boilers in homes with heat pumps. By 2035 every electron coursing through the nation's power grid would come from a renewable or zero-carbon source. In accordance with the government's recently announced plan for decarbonisation, a push for wind power would form the bulk of this, growing from 40GW in 2030 to at least 100GW in 2050. The committee also sees a role for hydrogen in heating some buildings as well as in powering ships and industry. Schemes to more than double the area that is planted with trees each year, and to slash cropland and grasslands, would transform large swathes of the landscape. All this would cost £50bn ($70bn) a year by 2030, five times the amount spent now.
Based on the ccc's recommendations, Britain will now adopt its sixth carbon budget, which will have to be met between 2033 and 2037. By law, it must adopt a new budget every five years, to set the pace for the economy's decarbonisation. The first two, running from 2008 to 2017, were met. Figures published in October show that British emissions are expected to squeak in just under budget for the third round. But the country is not on track to meet its fourth carbon budget and will miss the fifth by an even greater margin.
According to the ccc, the first and second budgets were probably met thanks to the global financial crisis. ""Policy has fallen short of bringing about the measures required to put the uk on course to meet its original long-term ambition of an 80% reduction, let alone the recently agreed net zero ambition,"" it noted last year. The covid-19 downturn will aid efforts to meet the third budget. But to be a true leader, Britain must stop relying on mishaps and put money and policy towards real change. *"

Learning-disabled Britons are the pandemic's forgotten victims
In a supported-living home for people with learning disabilities in Luton, there is no lack of Christmas cheer. One recent evening, staff helped the six women who live there decorate a gingerbread house; another day, they fashioned a collage of hand prints to resemble the outline of a Christmas tree. ""We're trying to make it as fun as we can,"" says Carly Somers, one of the workers. Still, it is an uphill battle. Normally, all but one of the women would go to relatives at least for the day itself; this year, they might well all have to stay put. ""That's going to be a big change for them.""
The past year has been trying for everyone. As Edel Harris, boss of Mencap, a charity that supports the six women and 5,000 or so others, puts it: ""For those of us without a learning disability, we're struggling at times to understand what's happening and to hang on to that hope"". For those who have one it has been even harder, as they struggle to understand change and often require help with everyday life. The latest hurdle is vaccination: most learning-disabled Britons are not in the priority queue for the jabs, the first of which began to be dished out on December 8th.
An official review last month suggested that covid-19 has killed people with learning disabilities at twice the rate of the general population and perhaps six times the rate once sex, age and probable underreporting are accounted for (see chart). That is partly because they are more likely than average to suffer underlying conditions, like diabetes and obesity, that increase risk. But it can also be difficult for them to grasp infection-prevention advice and the need to get tested if symptoms occur.
The virus has had a disproportionate impact on their mental health and well-being. Like many of the 1.5m learning-disabled Britons (of whom perhaps 350,000 have a severe disability), Ciara Lawrence has found the government's official updates on the pandemic hard to follow. ""[They] use jargon words like social distancing, shielding and quarantine,"" she says. ""When they show those graphs on the screen, it is so hard to understand. They show them really quickly.""
It can also be difficult to grasp that social clubs have been suspended rather than canned or understand why relatives have suddenly stopped visiting. Some learningdisabled people have been encouraged by carers to use video calls for the first time to keep in touch with their families. That is a welcome innovation, but no substitute for touch. A group of academics who spoke to learning-disabled Britons, their carers and advocacy groups about the impact of covid-19 reported increased social isolation and loneliness.
Those who look after their learning-disabled relatives themselves have felt the strain as well. Lots of day-care activities and home visits were halted, leaving them without respite. The government has encouraged local authorities to continue such services, while accepting this won't always be possible. A survey shows a majority of families say the support they receive has fallen by more than half.
The government is belatedly paying more attention to care homes, which bore the brunt of the pandemic's first wave and whose residents are desperate to be reunited with their families. But whereas carehome residents and staff were prioritised for covid tests, learning-disabled people living in their own homes or with family were not. Official advice on how the rules should apply to them has often been published weeks after similar information for providers of care to elderly adults. And a search of one newspaper database suggests that care-home residents have received about 36 times more coverage in the past year than those with learning disabilities. ""A lot of my friends feel they've been forgotten,"" says Ms Lawrence.
Only those with severe learning disabilities are currently in the priority queue for vaccination; those with moderate or mild ones will receive theirs at the same time as the general population. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, is lobbying publichealth officials to change their minds in recognition of the group's reliance on the support and affection of others as well as its clinical vulnerability. That would be a good start. Ms Lawrence, for one, can't wait. ""I'm not the biggest fan of needles,"" she says. Still, she will have the jab as soon as she can, ""if it means I can see my family and hug my mum."" *"

LERWICK
As North Sea oil dries up, locals turn to a new business: tearing apart oil rigs
Rounding the corner of Dales Voe, a sea loch in the Shetland Islands, Ninian North looms into view like a vast metallic mantis. Out of the water, the oil rig looks long and squat. Streaked with rust, it weighs 14,200 tonnes. For more than three decades the rig sucked oil from under the North Sea, producing 90,000 barrels a day at its peak in the early 1980s, and boosting the local economy in the process.
Now it awaits breakage, propped up against the Shetland sky by eight thick steel legs, lifeboats still dangling from its flanks (people often repurpose them as garden furniture, explains a worker). Men in hard hats and hi-vis vests take a cage lift up to the platform armed with angle grinders, blow torches and Geiger counters. They are stripping harmful substances out of Ninian, from asbestos to radioactive gunk dredged up from the sea floor.
In the late 1990s the North Sea delivered 4.5m barrels of oil a day. Now, it delivers just 1m. As production has tailed off, the Shetland Islands-home to 20,000 or so people, 110 miles north of Scotland-have sought new work. Tearing down the structures that fed the islands' economy for decades doesn't take up all the slack, but it helps. Britain is spending about £1.5bn ($2bn) a year on decommissioning, according to Oil and Gas uk, an industry body.
Ninian's new home at Dales Voe was built for this kind of work. Thanks to the depth of the loch for which the facility is named, it can handle structures that extend hundreds of metres underwater. The facility came into operation in 2017, and has so far decommissioned two rigs. Ninian North is its largest job yet. Veolia, a French waste- and energy-management firm, runs the project, and has said that it expects the North Sea decommissioning market to grow in coming years.
The Shetland Islands are not the only place competing for the these contracts. There are deepwater facilities in Newcastle and Norway, and Aberdeen is said to be mulling one of its own. Although the Shetland facility is a relative newbie, it has the advantage of being closer to the oilfields. Alexander Kemp of the National Decommissioning Centre at the University of Aberdeen reckons oil-rig operators will spend £50bn taking old platforms out of the sea by 2050.
A large chunk of that is due to be spent in the next 15 years, when a number of the biggest, oldest fields are due for decommissioning-and the covid-19 pandemic has further accelerated things. The price of a barrel of crude slumped from $50 in February to $40 today, and was briefly as low as $16 in April, meaning oil-producing assets it might have made sense to keep in operation are no longer viable, and need to be taken out of the water.
Even so, those rig operators who are not making money are having a hard time paying for expensive decommissioning. It helps that they can offset their expenses against taxes that have already been paid. Yet this has caused rows with environmental groups, as the Treasury ends up owing oil companies-like Canadian Natural Resources, which owns Ninian-a refund.
The Shetland Islands will hope the subsidies continue. Sometime in May next year, at midnight, a demolition crew will blow out Ninian's enormous steel legs, and its body will slump to the ground like a dying beast. Men will swarm the carcass, and begin tearing it apart in Lerwick's midsummer gloam. Out in the North Sea, another 1.8m tons of oil and gas rig await the same treatment. *"

BERLIN
Europe prepares to receive its first batches of the covid-19 vaccine. But supplies and uptake are both uncertain
In a typical year the Velodrom, an indoor arena in Berlin that can hold 12,000 people, hosts sports events, trade shows and concerts. This year, the biggest gig it is preparing for is a mass vaccination drive. If all goes to plan, in early January people will start streaming through its 75 booths that are being set up for dishing out doses of Germany's first supplies of covid-19 vaccines. Two of Berlin's disused airports and other venues are also being turned into vaccination centres. The plan is to be ready to vaccinate 20,000 Berliners a day over six weeks. This would account for 10% of the city's residents, mainly the very old.
Germany is rushing to set up more than 430 mass vaccination sites like these. It is also organising roaming vaccination teams for care homes. In spring, vaccines will become available at doctors' offices. Mobile teams will visit the infirm at home.
Other European countries are preparing too, though most are far behind Germany. Italy plans to set up 300 covid-19 vaccination sites, starting in hospitals, along with mobile units. The laggards are in eastern Europe, where some countries have done little more than set up task forces.
The starting shot for vaccination in the European Union will be fired on December 29th, when the European Medicines Agency (ema), the eu's drug regulator, is expected to decide on a covid-19 vaccine created by Pfizer and BioNTech, which has already been approved in Britain. On January 12th the ema will make the call on a second vaccine, by the American firm Moderna. Other covid-19 vaccines that are still in clinical trials will follow. By the look of things, at some point in 2021 most European countries may be using three or more covid-19 vaccines simultaneously.
A mix of vaccines will be needed. Global supplies of any one of them will be crimped for months. Sharp elbowing for vaccines during the 2009 hini (swine flu) pandemic left some European countries unable to procure any. Wary of that, the European Commission, the eu's executive branch, earlier this year organised joint pre-purchase agreements on behalf of all 27 member states with the developers of several prospective covid-19 vaccines (see chart overleaf). These firms received hundreds of millions of euros to set up production facilities, even before their vaccines are approved. In return, they are reserving large amounts of their first vials for the eu at a set price. Approved vaccines will be distributed by the manufacturers to every eu country in proportion to its population, as batches become available.
At the moment, the eu has been promised up to 300m doses of Pfizer's vaccine and 160m doses of Moderna's. Both require two shots per course, so this should be enough to cover 60% of all the eu's adults. The snag is that not much of it will be ready before spring, even if there are no production hitches, which is hardly guaranteed given that the vaccines are new and production chains span several countries. In early 2021 Italy, a country of 60m, expects to get enough of the two vaccines for only 4.7m people. By some estimates, if Germany relies on its allotment of Pfizer's vaccine alone, it will take two years to get enough for 60% of its population, the estimated threshold for ""herd immunity"", the level that stops the disease from spreading.
Hence the impatience of some countries, which are looking to top up their eu allotments. Hungary is importing a Russian vaccine not vetted by the ema. Germany is cutting its own deals with Pfizer and other vaccine-makers, joining a queue that already includes America, Britain, Japan and a global consortium buying covid-19 vaccines for poorer countries. All of this leaves European governments pinning hopes on the success of some of the other vaccines in the pipeline, and soon.
Since demand will exceed supply for some time, governments are stepping in to decide who will get priority. The answer varies by country. Bulgaria, for example, plans to start with medical workers because its hospitals are bursting with covid-19 patients, and infections among doctors and nurses are rampant.
Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, by contrast, have weighed up the benefits of vaccinating various groups and decided to start with the elderly. German experts considered three scenarios: vaccinating those with pre-existing health conditions, the over-6os and people over 80. Their statistical models suggest that if only 500,000 people a week can be vaccinated, over a 12week period the greatest reduction in deaths and hospitalisations will occur if all of them are over 80. The total years of life gained by vaccinating this group was also estimated to be the largest.
By April or May, Europe's vaccination woes may swing the other way: vials of vaccine may be more plentiful but takers may be too few. Surveys asking Europeans whether they would be willing to get a covid-19 jab are returning dispiriting results (see chart 2 and Charlemagne). Ipsos mori, a pollster, found that in some countries the share of people who say yes actually fell between August and October.
An early sign to watch will be the uptake rate among health workers, whom most European countries plan to jab early on. As things stand, many of them avoid seasonal flu shots and have doubts about the safety of the first covid-19 vaccines. Medics are as prone to believing misinformation about vaccines as anyone else. But Jacques de Haller, a former president of the Standing Committee of European Doctors, a professional association, says that some doctors avoid flu shots out of sheer arrogance, believing they are impervious to the disease.
Based on all this, some experts fear that, without strong public-messaging campaigns, the uptake of vaccines in Europe, even in countries that do well, could be as little as 40%. Mass public-communication campaigns are already being planned. One idea floated in Germany is the slogan ""Sleeves up"", with photos of people cheerfully getting the jab, possibly with a single central phone number that people can call for an appointment.
But a lot more than posters and slogans will be needed. In France, where people are among the most suspicious in Europe about any vaccine, millions have watched ""Hold-Up"", a slick two-hour online documentary packed with conspiracy fiction about covid-19 vaccines. It is just accurate enough to confuse viewers. As pallets of vaccine begin to arrive in European cities, a big question remains unanswered. Will people correctly see it as the best way to protect grandma, curb the pandemic and bring life back to normal? Or will they see it as a risky drug peddled by untrustworthy governments and corporations, and decide not to roll up their sleeves? If too many make the wrong or selfish choice, 2021 will be another annus horribilis. *"

BERLIN
The joys and perils of Glühwein gatherings
It is a chilly winter evening in a courtyard in Prenzlauer Berg, a chic district in Berlin. The company is convivial, a fire pit is blazing and two cheerful barmen are serving up endless glasses of steaming Glühwein, a Christmassy concoction of spices, citrus, sugar and (usually bad) red wine. Under coronavirus restrictions the drinks are supposed to be consumed elsewhere. But here, and across Germany's cities, that rule is honoured mainly in the breach. Warmly wrapped (but often unmasked) customers clutching their grog gather in small groups around tables or the fire. And the most magical property of Glühwein-it becomes undrinkable once it cools-ensures a steady stream of refills.
German bars and restaurants have been closed to seated custom since November 2nd. Setting up impromptu Glühwein stands is one way for their owners to replace a bit of lost income, especially as Germany's beloved Christmas markets, where visitors usually quaff gallons of the stuff, have also been cancelled this year. There are drive-in Glühwein stands in Bavaria and Glühwein taxis in Lower Saxony. Some outlets have organised ""Glühwein happenings"" (although police had to break up one in Heidelberg that attracted 200 people). And with most other forms of public drinking off-limits, this most traditional of libations has even acquired a mild hipster edge.
Unsurprisingly, all this jollity has caught the attention of the authorities. Several cities and states have already banned open-air alcohol sales, and more seem certain to follow. ""I know how much love has gone into setting up the Glühwein stands,"" said Angela Merkel, the chancellor, in an emotional speech to the Bundestag on December 9th. ""But this is not compatible with the agreement we have made to take food away to eat at home.""
In Germany, unlike in all other large European countries, the covid-19 caseload is growing. Every day a fresh record number of deaths is recorded. Mrs Merkel has endorsed an expert panel's recommendation for a tougher lockdown, including extended school holidays and business and shop closures. The experts offered no specific views on Glühwein stands. But politicians are surely mulling it over."

PARIS
A controversial new bill is set to combat Islamism
Nearly two months after the beheading of Samuel Paty, a schoolteacher who had shown pupils caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, the French government has unveiled a bill to clamp down on radical Islamism. This, at least, is the implicit aim of a draft law presented on December 9th. President Emmanuel Macron had promised a bill to combat ""Islamist separatism"". But, to pre-empt charges of stigmatising Islam, the final version has been reframed as a text ""to reinforce the principles of the republic"".
The bill, declared Jean Castex, the prime minister, is ""not a text against religion, nor against the Muslim religion"". Rather, he said, it is ""a law of emancipation against religious fundamentalism"", designed to reinforce such principles as laícité (secularism) and gender equality. It was presented on the 115th anniversary of the adoption of a law that separated religion and the state, and first enshrined laícité. This strict French version of secularism protects the right both to believe and not to believe, as well as requiring religious neutrality in public life.
The new provisions, which will go through parliament in early 2021, include tight curbs on home-schooling (though not a ban, as originally promised). Parents will need to apply for permission if they wish to teach their children at home, and to justify it. The aim is to limit the use of home-schooling as a way to escape state oversight of radical Koranic teaching. Officials say they have uncovered such classes in some neighbourhoods.
The bill will also make it easier for the government to inspect and shut places of worship or associations that get public subsidies, if they do not respect ""republican principles"", such as women's equality. A ban on state employees displaying ""conspicuous"" religious symbols, such as the hijab or crucifix, will be extended from the state administration to any form of subcontracted public service, such as job centres (although, with the existing exception of schools, there is no such ban on those using public services, including universities). Those who threaten officials with violence to secure concessions on religious grounds will face criminal penalties.
Finally, doctors will be forbidden to issue ""virginity certificates"" in order to protect women from pre-nuptial pressure. It will also be illegal to divulge or publish information that locates or identifies individuals in a way that puts them in danger, with stiffer penalties for identifying those in positions of public authority. This measure is a direct response to the murder of Paty, whose assassin identified him on social media before travelling to the school where he taught.
The government argues that it needs stronger powers in order to break up ""counter-societies"". Associations under radical Islamist influence, it says, have increasingly created parallel societies, running services from creches to sports activities, and are waging a war for the minds of the young. Since 2017 intelligence services, magistrates and the state have worked in 15 such neighbourhoods to ""destabilise"" networks, closing 15 places of worship and four schools. Such ""enclaves"", argues Gilles Kepel, author of a forthcoming book on the Middle East and jihadism, became a way for global jihadists to recruit fighters, provoke Islamophobia and divide Western societies. Between 2012 and 2018 over 2,000 French citizens left to take part in jihad in Syria, and more than 250 people were killed in terrorist attacks in France.
Since his election Mr Macron has come to believe that tougher rules are needed to defend French society from such influences. Indeed, Eric Dupond-Moretti, the justice minister, described the bill as a ""great law of liberty"". In 2004, when France banned ""conspicuous"" religious symbols from state schools, recalls Patrick Weil, a French historian, the commission of inquiry that preceded the law concluded that it was necessary to protect girls from fundamentalist pressure to wear the hijab.
Not everybody, however, sees it this way. Critics say that the bill hands too much power to the state to overrule local authorities, and that it infringes the right to religious practice that laícité is supposed to guarantee. Some also accuse the government of mistaking conservative religiosity for sinister intent, and of ignoring the structural racism behind the development of French ghettos. Mr Macron has indeed so far put less emphasis on his promise to fight racial discrimination than on the war against Islamism. In parts of the Muslim world, he is accused of being not just antiIslamism, but against the religion itself.
In France, though, there is broad support for Mr Macron's measures, both on the mainstream left (most of which is firmly laíc) and the right-although the far right's Marine Le Pen considers them too tame. Some Muslim leaders have also backed them. Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, said that the overall aim ""reassures French Muslims"", since extremists are such a ""marginal minority"". A recent poll showed that 79% of the French agree that ""Islamism is at war with France""; 72% of Socialist voters agreed, and 90% on the centre-right. With less than 18 months before the next presidential election, Mr Macron's tough line on Islamism may be criticised abroad, but is likely to prove popular at home. *"

ROME
The Brothers of Italy are on a roll
The scandals that demolished Italy's post-war political order in the early 1990s brought a new generation into public life. Among them was Giorgia Meloni, who at the age of 15 chose to join the youth branch of the Italian Social Movement (msi), the direct heirs of the Fascist Party and its leader, Benito Mussolini, who ruled Italy as a dictator until 1943.
Today Ms Meloni is riding high as a leader herself. Her party, the Brothers of Italy (Fdi), has been the outstanding beneficiary of the covid-19 pandemic. Since late February, when it was already on a roll, the party has climbed steadily in the opinion polls from around 12% to more than 16%. It has overtaken the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, notionally the senior partner in Giuseppe Conte's governing coalition. The Fdi is ""becoming firmly established as Italy's third party"", says Antonio Noto of Noto Sondaggi, a polling firm. Nor is it unthinkable that it may soon become the second. Some recent soundings have put Ms Meloni's party just four points behind the centre-left Democratic Party, also in the government. Mr Conte's coalition looks increasingly fragile. It is split by a row over divvying out money from the eu's covid-19 recovery fund. Were it to fall, an election might produce a hard-right coalition government consisting of the Fdi and Matteo Salvini's Northern League, which still leads in the opinion polls, with around 24%.
The rise in the Brothers' popularity has almost exactly matched the fall in support for the League. Mr Salvini's raucous showmanship has jarred with an electorate gripped by fear of the virus and its economic consequences. At the same time even diehard nativists must question the League's leader's continuing emphasis on unauthorised immigration. So far this year 33,000 migrants have reached Italy, almost three times as many as in 2019 but a far cry from the 181,000 who arrived in 2017.
Ms Meloni has conveyed a more nuanced and sober message, typical of her canny stewardship of a movement that two years ago won less than 5% of the vote at the last general election. Brothers of Italy may be a slightly odd name for a party led by a woman, but it echoes the first line of the national anthem. Under Ms Meloni the Fdi has remained passionately nationalistic and wedded to identity politics. Its motto is ""God, family and fatherland"". Top of its 15-point programme is greatly increased support for families, to boost the birth rate so Italy no longer needs immigrant workers. It is fiercely against giving automatic citizenship to children born in Italy of immigrant parents, and would impose a naval blockade to stop further arrivals.
The Fdi originated in 2012 as a splinter group, made up of lawmakers from the right of Silvio Berlusconi's catch-all conservative alliance, the People of Freedom. It particularly objected to the tv mogul's high-handed leadership and his tolerance of EU-imposed austerity. The Brothers' programme calls for a ""rediscussion"" of all the Eu's treaties, including those underpinning the euro.
But since taking over the leadership in 2014, Ms Meloni, unlike Mr Salvini, has played down her party's Euroscepticism. In other areas, too, she has striven to give her party a more moderate image. That got a boost in September when she was elected head of the pan-continental European Conservatives and Reformists Party. Though it includes the likes of Vox in Spain and Poland's Law and Justice party, it also includes Britain's Conservatives, allowing the Fdi to project itself as no longer belonging to the extreme right.
Perhaps the most telling similarity between Italy's two hard-right parties is that each is geographically challenged. The Fdi's support comes mostly from the south and centre, just as the League's base is largely confined to the north. Together they could make a formidable combination. *"

BUCHAREST
Romania's next government will have a weak mandate for fighting corruption
Corruption is the biggest political issue across most of eastern Europe, and Romania is no exception. In recent years the streets of Bucharest, its capital, have filled with huge demonstrations against crooked officials and their attempts to weaken the rule of law. Yet on December 6th, when it was time to vote, the city was eerily quiet. Just 32% of eligible voters cast a ballot in the general election, the lowest turnout since the fall of the communist regime in 1989. Some blamed covid-19, others lacklustre politicians and their almost non-existent campaign. It was a sadly missed chance to elect a government with a strong mandate to tackle graft.
Many had expected the election to bring stability, after years of brief, scandalplagued governments. Instead it offered more uncertainty. The opposition Social Democratic Party (psd), a centre-left outfit that promises to raise welfare benefits, got an unexpectedly high 29% of the vote. The ruling centre-right National Liberal Party (pnl) got only 25% and usr-plus, an alliance of anti-corruption parties, won 15%-both scoring well below what pollsters had bet on. ""There is no clear winner,"" said Klaus Iohannis, Romania's president.
To be sure, there was a clear loser. The National Liberals' Ludovic Orban, the prime minister, quickly resigned. But his party looks set to stay in power. Though the psd won, it remains discredited by a recent stint in government and lacks allies, so pnl is likely to form a coalition with usr-plus and one other party. Negotiations will probably be quick, says Radu Magdin, a political consultant. But any talk of a strong mandate is gone. Whoever takes over as the PNL's new leader will, astonishingly, be the country's seventh prime minister since 2015.
The previous election four years ago brought in a psD-led government that spent much of its time trying to weaken various laws in order to keep its then leader, Liviu Dragnea, out of prison: he was on trial for abuse of power. Hundreds of thousands of Romanians took to the streets, worried lest the country follow the anti-democratic path blazed by Hungary and Poland. Ultimately Mr Dragnea was jailed, and his psd was ousted in a no-confidence vote in October last year.
Many then expected the National Liberals to enjoy a period of strength. But the pandemic cost them support. The government imposed a strict lockdown that nonetheless failed to contain the virus. Romania's health system, crippled by the emigration of staff to higher-paying jobs in western Europe, has struggled to cope. On November 14th a fire at a hospital in the city of Piatra Neamt killed 15 covid-19 patients.
The anti-corruption activists of usrplus had high hopes after recent local successes. In September the candidate they backed defeated a psd mayor of Bucharest who was often accused of cronyism. But they ran a poor campaign for parliament, and hopes that their voters would be unusually dedicated were dashed. The psd has an advantage when turnout is low, says Veronica Anghel, a political scientist: its party machine of local officials can still get out the vote.
The biggest surprise was the Alliance for Romanian Unity (aur), a new ultranationalist party. No one expected it to clear the 5% threshold to get into parliament. It took 9%. Its platform mixes religious patriotism with a call to annex neighbouring Moldova and ""a hodgepodge of conspiracy theories"", says Cristian Norocel of Lund University, an expert on Europe's far right.

When pfizer and BioNTech unveiled their covid-19 vaccine, politicians from across Europe bustled to claim a slice of credit. German politicians reminded people that BioNTech was founded by two Germans of Turkish origin. Belgian ones were quick to note that the vaccine is manufactured in Belgium. eu officials hailed the way in which 27 countries had clubbed together to buy up enough stocks. Britain had to content itself with boasting that its regulators were the quickest to approve the drug.
Yet for a surprisingly large number of Europeans, a different emotion came before pride: paranoia. Despite scrupulous tests showing that the vaccine is safe, many people doubt it. One in three French people thinks vaccines in general are unsafe-the highest figure for any country, according to the Wellcome Trust, a British charity. A whopping 46% say they would reject a covid-19 vaccine when offered it, according to an Ipsos mori poll. And France is not alone. In Italy, the eu's third-largest economy, the Five Star Movement won power in part due to their avid fearmongering about vaccines. Nor is such dangerous poppycock confined to western Europe. More than 40% of people in Poland and Hungary say they would reject a covid-19 vaccine if offered. How did Europe become such a crucible of credulity?
Vaccine doubters have been around for as long as vaccination itself. An 18th-century French cartoon features two wicked characters chasing children with a syringe, dragging a green, smallpoxridden monster behind them. Voltaire despaired at his countrymen's misguided reluctance to try the rudimentary inoculations then becoming common in England. In the eyes of his fellow Frenchmen, the English were ""fools...and madmen"", he wrote. Yet even so, riots in 19th-century England kicked off when the government made vaccines mandatory. People on Facebook today who swap hare-brained theories about Bill Gates wanting to insert tracking chips into everyone are the heirs to 19th-century pamphleteers who suggested people would grow horns if they took a vaccine. Europe has always been a republic of letters. Unfortunately it is also sometimes a republic of cranks.
What has changed is the motivation. In the 18th and 19th century objections were often religious, with illness ascribed to God's will, or concern at the idea of interfering with nature, argues Laurent-Henri Vignaud, a historian of science at the University of Bourgogne. Now it is political. There is a correlation between doubting vaccines and voting for populist parties, points out Jonathan Kennedy of Queen Mary University of London. Both movements are about fear. Just as populist leaders of the left and the right stoke suspicion of Davos Man, so anti-vaxxers fret about another shadowy global elite-Big Pharma. Both populists and antivaxxers share an ability to turn a kernel of truth into a wider deception. Immigration has changed Europe, but that does not mean it caused all the continent's problems, as populists suggest. In the same way, the opioid epidemic in America raises questions about the ethics of some drug firms, but that does not mean they want to put a chip in your brain. The same reflex lies at the heart of both: a distrust of experts and institutions. Europe is, increasingly, a paranoid continent, where people's minds are filled with visions of enemies, mostly illusory. Vaccines join immigrants, Muslims and a host of others as the bogeyman du jour.
Politicians feel they must tread carefully. The British regulator's speedy approval came in the knowledge that eight in ten Brits were keen on the vaccine even before a public-health campaign showed happy pensioners being jabbed. Swiss regulators have taken a more cautious approach, in a bid to allay the concerns of vaccine doubters. Jens Spahn, the German health minister, declared: ""Nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines."" It is, however, possible to be too cautious. Those who know France best suggest that people will be queuing up for the vaccine when it arrives. It is one thing to spurn a vaccine while Emmanuel Macron is extolling its virtues. It is quite another to reject one suggested by a family doctor. Actions do not always match words, particularly in France, where citizens often tick the most pessimistic box possible in surveys about the government. Long-held French doubts about vaccination do not manifest themselves in significantly lower take-up.
Likewise, anti-vax sentiment can flame out. While in opposition, the Five Star Movement, which is part of Italy's governing coalition, happily stirred up fear of vaccines. Mandatory vaccines were ""a gift for Big Pharma"", said Beppe Grillo, the former comedian who co-founded the party. In government, however, conspiracy theories collided with reality: a measles outbreak triggered the introduction of strict measures the party had once opposed. Populist campaigning does not translate well to the actual problems of government. In a peculiar twist, Five Star supporters are now more likely to support the idea of a covid-19 vaccine than the average Italian. European countries have grown unused to large-scale premature death. The horror of the pandemic, and the prospect of stopping it, may shock them back to their senses.
Vax populi
In the coming months, a lack of supply rather than a lack of demand is a bigger problem for governments organising vaccinations, says Jonathan Berman, author of ""Anti-vaxxers: How to Challenge a Misinformed Movement"". Indeed, talking too much about vaccine refusal could provoke the very panic governments want to avoid.
Fringe views are more likely to spread when people lose trust in their leaders. So the most effective (figurative) vaccine against anti-vax nonsense would be for governments to roll out their actual covid-19 vaccination programmes as quickly and smoothly as possible, with a minimum of cock-ups. When elites do their jobs well, populists and cranks have less to froth about. *"

CHICAGO
Six months after mass protests started to rock America, a stronger black-lives movement may be emerging
""When there's a chance to make change, we must be ready to take it, says YahNé Ndgo, a singer and activist with Philadelphia's chapter of Black Lives Matter (blm). Events over the past six months, she says, have brought a rare chance to shape national affairs. Protests flared across America after footage spread of the death of George Floyd, an AfricanAmerican who was choked for nearly nine minutes by a policeman in Minneapolis in May. By one count over 8,500 civil-rights demonstrations have taken place since.
The sight of thousands of marchers, usually young and mostly peaceful, helped to sway public attitudes in ways small and big. Kenya McKnight, who runs a group in Minneapolis educating black women about finance, says she was invigorated, feeling new ""validation for her work. Oluchi Omeoga at Black Visions Collective, a grant-giving body in the same city, is also fired up, saying America has entered ""a different phase, one hundred percent. Public support for the blm movement, founded seven years ago, soared to an unheard-of 67% in June, according to Pew researchers. It has slipped a bit since, but remains high.
Voters, especially Democrats, responded. Joe Biden has concluded that more African-Americans must be seen in prominent jobs. His choice of Kamala Harris, who is part African-American, as his runningmate proved popular. This week he picked Lloyd Austin as defence secretary. If the retired four-star general is confirmed, he would be the first African-American to preside over the Pentagon. That matters, says the incoming president, to ""make sure that our armed forces reflect and promote the full diversity of our nation. His cabinet will be home to many non-white faces.
Does this amount to a new wave for the civil-rights movement? blm looked bereft before the summer. Several activists say the national part of their movement had lost its way. Ms Ndgo, who is critical of national leaders, says it had become ""a shambles. Local chapters were passionate, but focused mostly on holding rallies in response to violent incidents by police. blm boasted of its grass-roots organising and decentralised, leaderless structure. But critics say that proved messy, bureaucratic, slow-moving and ineffective.
Patrisse Cullors (pictured), one of blm's three co-founders, bluntly blamed her movement's ""half-drawn blueprints and road maps that led to untenable ends, as well as its lack of funds and vision. Black people, she wrote in September, had ""paid dearly for these shortcomings. Better focus and organisation were needed.
Some of that has changed. Start with the great fire-hose of money pointed at blm groups and sympathisers. The example of Niko Georgiades of Unicorn Riot, a nonprofit, left-leaning media firm that posted early footage of protests in Minneapolis, is instructive. Thanks to online donations, within a couple of months his almostbroke outfit went from $8,000 in the bank to nearly $650,000. That's enough to keep operating for another five years, he says joyfully. Ms McKnight saw donations flood in from people in America, Europe, Japan and Brazil. Within a month of the protests, blm's national network had to scramble to offer a first round of $6.5m in grants-far more than ever before-to city chapters, gay-rights groups and others.
That was just a start. Vastly larger promises and sums followed as employee and corporate donors, as well as rich individuals, joined the gift-giving. Donations to BLM-related causes since May were $i0.6bn. Exact sums received will be known when the central body overseeing blm spending publishes its finances (confusingly it relies on another entity, a ""fiscal sponsor, the Tides Foundation, to oversee
its books). A leading figure talks of ""incredible financial growth and capacity, and a huge surge in ""the number of folks who want to throw down with us, meaning long-term partners.
Another change, the restructuring of blm, could turn out to be just as significant: power is to be centralised. Ms Cullors has stood up as the boss of blm's Global Network Foundation, which she calls the ""umbrella organisation for the whole movement. In taking responsibility, as she says, for the ""onus of our successes and failures, she appears to be claiming leadership of the once leaderless movement.
That is because the foundation will control funds, dishing them out to officially recognised blm city chapters through another new body called blm Grassroots. The foundation is also moving away from doing mostly on-the-ground work. For example, it is pressing Congress to pass legislation, known as the Breathe Act, that would order a big increase in federal spending on public housing. Leaders of the foundation were hoping to meet members of Mr Biden's transition team this week. In October a blm political-action committee was launched, to ""bring the power of our movement from the streets to the ballot box.
That reflects new ambition, what Ms Cullors has called ""a totalising and unprecedented transition for blm. It has long focused largely on police violence, mass incarceration and other criminal-justice woes. The idea is to confront the way African-Americans live, not only their repression and deaths.
blm leaders plan, for example, to campaign for more funding for the Postal Service, a big employer of middle-class African-Americans. Early next year it hopes to launch a bank to push capital to blackowned firms and non-profit groups. That reflects a wish to address problems of race and economic inequality.
All that is appealing if the movement is to be more effective than just a protest outfit. But the changes have upset radicals, such as those who prefer the idea of abolishing capitalism over making banks work better, or who reject electoral politics as intrinsically ineffective. On November 30th representatives of ten city chapters, including large ones from Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Washington, said they rejected the recent changes as an undemocratic, secretive power-grab done without the backing of most blm members.
One opponent, Vanessa Green, a blm organiser in Hudson Valley, New York, says nobody was consulted about launching the political-action committee. Earlier complaints from smaller groups like hers about the centralisation of power were brushed aside in the rush to change. ""You have to include every damn body, she says. ""To be ignored, it feels like a slap in the face. She sees blm as an offspring of the radical Black Power activism of the 1960s, but fears it is instead becoming ""vanilla, ineffective and co-opted by those who resist change.
Ms Ndgo is also upset at secrecy. She warns that Ms Cullors, if she does emerge as the main blm leader, may be out of touch because ""she is not on the streets, not grass-roots organising. She complains that the foundation has been woefully opaque about its money.
The schism between the two camps is unlikely to end, but it is also doubtful that the disgruntled ten chapters can lure more to their camp. Nobody owns the blm trademark. Nor can anyone say convincingly what counts as an official chapter of the movement. That means both camps are free to go on operating. Much will depend on who has more resources to help activists or mount bigger campaigns. If the money keeps flowing to the foundation that Ms Cullors runs, then her more-organised vision for blm may emerge stronger."

NEW YORK
Long-suffering black entrepreneurs may soon have reasons for cheer
Black entrepreneurs face a mighty struggle. African-Americans make up about 13% of the country's population but only 2% of its business-owners. Their firms earn just 0.3% of total business receipts. Minority-owned businesses are less profitable than comparable whiteowned firms, and have much higher rates of failure.
The pandemic has hit these firms especially hard. Black-owned firms were nearly twice as likely to shut down (by August, over two-fifths had done so) because of covid-19 as small firms overall. Emergency aid often did not reach them, in part because the Small Business Administration (sba) did not direct banks to prioritise lending to such firms as Congress intended.
Black entrepreneurs may now have two reasons for cheer. One is top-down. Past efforts by the federal government to boost minority enterprises, a mix of loan guarantees and quota schemes, have fallen short. A recent analysis by McKinsey, a consultancy, notes that although the sba awarded some $2.3bn in federal contracts and backed about $210m in loans for disadvantaged businesses in 2019, these schemes were ""often imperfectly implemented"".
The incoming administration is promising a big revamp. Joe Biden vows to fund such firms to retain and rehire workers. After the pandemic, he wants to expand training, small-business incubators and innovation hubs for ""black and brown entrepreneurs"". He also promises to create a $3obn Small Business Opportunity Fund and to direct additional billions to minority firms.
But the playing field for black entrepreneurs is not level, argues Dana Peterson of the Conference Board, a business-research firm: access to credit is ""too often determined by the colour of the skin"". Black households have just a tenth the assets of white ones. In addition, notes Katherine Klein of the Wharton School, they tend to have lower credit scores. Black female entrepreneurs receive less than 1% of all venture capital.
So even a tenfold increase in government funding would not solve the problem, argues Shelley Stewart of McKinsey, without bottom-up fixes too. That points to the second reason for cheer. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, corporate titans have made big commitments to boost black businesses. JPMorgan Chase, a banking Goliath, says it will pour $3obn over five years into boosting black and Latino households and businesses. Citi, another giant bank, vows to take on ""the racial wealth gap"" with a $1bn pledge.
Sceptics worry this will prove mere ""race-washing"" and that Mr Biden's efforts will get mired in red tape. But if they do take off, then black entrepreneurs might at last have a fighting chance. If they could achieve revenue parity with comparable white-owned businesses, McKinsey reckons, it would boost their business equity by $290bn."

NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, DC
Donald Trump's deepening defeat
Four years ago Democrats groused that Donald Trump had secured victory in the presidential election through razorthin victories in three states, meaning that 77,774 voters in effect swung the election. This time, regardless of a lopsided popular vote in the Democrats' favour, the electoral-college margin was even thinner. The final, certified results show that had just 43,560 voters, or 0.03% of the total, in three states (Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin) changed their minds, there would have been a tie in the electoral college. The outcome would then have been decided by a still more arcane, less-majoritarian election in the House of Representatives, probably in Mr Trump's favour-making it the third time in 20 years that Democrats would have lost the presidency despite winning the popular vote.
That nightmarish scenario for Democrats has been narrowly avoided, however. All states except Wisconsin finalised their results by December 8th. On December 14th the electoral college will meet and elect Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States. It will do so by a pledged margin of 306 votes to 232. This is exactly the same as Mr Trump's margin four years ago, which he described as a ""landslide"" back then and now decries as pure fraud.
The full picture of the election has emerged only slowly. Early on the evening of November 3rd, Mr Trump won the crucial state of Florida with unexpected ease. He looked stronger than anticipated in Georgia and North Carolina. Rather than leading by ten percentage points in the popular vote, as some polls had predicted, Mr Biden appeared to be nearly tied with the president on election night-a thin margin of 1.5 points, or just 1.9m votes. Given the electoral college's inherent advantage for Republicans, Democrats struggled with their traumatic recollections of Mr Trump's seemingly unimaginable defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
In the end, the popular vote was not nearly as close as that (see chart). The picture changed partly because of the perennial slow vote-counting in populous Democratic strongholds such as California and New York, and also because of the unusually large numbers of (mostly Democratic-leaning) Americans who voted by post in this cycle because of the covid-19 pandemic. Mr Biden's popular-vote margin has swelled to 4.5 points, or more than 7m Americans.
That is a good bit healthier than Hillary Clinton's margin of 2.1 percentage points. Even so, Democrats came surprisingly close to losing the election as a result of America's byzantine electoral-college rules, which inflate the value of small, typically Republican-leaning states and allocate votes on a winner-take-all basis.
The president is still denying defeat, refusing to concede or to go gently into that good night. His legal team has racked up an impressive record of one win and nearly 50 losses challenging election results in state and federal courts on its quixotic quest to overturn the outcome.
On December 8th Mr Trump got the especially sobering piece of news that the Supreme Court, which he had been ""counting on"" to look at the ballots and deliver him a second presidential term, had stamped out a wild lawsuit that sought to reverse his loss in Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs sought to toss away the state's entire mail-in ballot, which would have disenfranchised 2.6m voters. The end came in a whimper: a one-sentence order issued merely 34 minutes after the plaintiffs, a group of eight Pennsylvania Republicans, filed their last brief. No justices noted their dissent.
As preposterous as this contention was, it attracted the support of 23 House Republicans and Senator Ted Cruz, who had offered to argue the case before the court. And the brusquely rejected case did not even take the prize for the wackiest and most anti-democratic lawsuit. That honour goes to the state of Texas, which sued four other states-Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin-in an attempt to throw out Mr Biden's victories on the day states were required to finalise their results. The Supreme Court will entertain this chutzpah-laden request no more than it did the other last-ditch effort. In the words of Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine, the move is merely ""a press release masquerading as a lawsuit""."

Long time passing
Yesterday's outrage often slips away quietly. In 2016 a North Carolina law requiring transgender people to use the toilet of their birth sex upset the nation's stomach. Companies pulled out of ventures in the state, sports leagues called off games and rock stars cancelled concerts. The law was repealed and replaced with one which prevented state and local agencies from regulating who uses which toilet in public buildings, but barred local governments from passing non-discrimination laws blocking private businesses from doing the same. On December 1st that ban expired, meaning that local governments in North Carolina can enact legislation to prevent discrimination against lgbt people.
Thus closes another chapter in the politics of the toilet. The story is a long one. In the 1950s and 60s civil-rights protesters decried ""whites only"" latrines. An Oakland assemblywoman, Margaret Fong Eu, took a sledgehammer to a toilet wrapped in chains outside the state capitol in 1969 to protest against pay toilets in public buildings, arguing that they placed an undue burden on women because urinals were often free. Activists poured fake urine over the steps of Harvard's Lowell Hall in 1973 demanding ""potty parity"", the equitable distribution of male and female toilets. Grip bars in bathrooms were among the demands of the disability protesters who occupied a federal building in San Francisco for 26 days in 1977.
The feminist fight against pay toilets, and a campaign by a student group, the Committee to End Pay Toilets in America, led to many states banning pay toilets in the 1970s. Vandalism and the cost of upkeep shut down many public ones. Discussions about public toilets assume they are still widely available, according to Taunya Lovell Banks, of the University of Maryland, but ""free or low-cost public toilets operated by government have largely disappeared"", and access to toilets in government buildings has been reduced since the Oklahoma City Bombing and 9/11.
So those caught short must duck into a local business and awkwardly ask for relief. ""Restrooms are for customers only"" signs mean it often takes a penny to spend a penny, creating a barrier to the poor. Where public urination is criminalised, the homeless may have no option but to risk arrest by going in public places. In some states, this can land them on the sex-offender registry. Closures of toilets during covid-19 have only added to the problem.
The lack of accessible toilets has publichealth consequences. Holding water for too long can lead to urinary-tract infections, and failure to defecate can lead to constipation and haemorrhoids. This can be difficult for workers who lack easy access to toilets, such as taxi drivers, and disproportionately affects women, who need to go more frequently. No toilets also means no soap. An outbreak of hepatitis A linked to the lack of toilets led to the death of 20 and the hospitalisation of hundreds in San Diego in 2017.
Public toilets are costly to install and maintain, and can attract undesirable behaviour. But spurred on by America's homelessness crisis, some cities are answering the call. The right to urinate might not be up there with the right to vote, but having it guaranteed would be a relief."

AIRMONT, NEW YORK
The federal government sues a village for religious discrimination (again)
Asukkah is a temporary hut built for Sukkot, a weeklong Jewish festival. It is usually covered in branches. In September 2017 the then mayor of Airmont, a village 35 miles north of New York City, ordered the fire inspector to the home of the mayor's neighbours, an Orthodox Jewish family, to demand the family dismantle its sukkah. According to a lawsuit filed by the federal government on December 2nd, the inspector, at the mayor's direction, threatened the family with immediate eviction unless the sukkah was taken down. The family dismantled it, despite the sukkah not violating any law.
This is one of several examples of alleged religious discrimination offered by the Department of Justice in its lawsuit against Airmont. It asserts that the village adopted discriminatory zoning codes and land-use practices that violate federal law and previous court judgments. Airmont claims the government is misinterpreting the village code. Yet this is the third time the federal government has filed a suit against the village since it was incorporated in 1991. A jury unanimously found in 1995 that the village's first mayor, trustees and zoning board had engaged in a conspiracy to deprive Orthodox Jewish residents of their civil rights. One local said at the time: ""the only reason we formed this village is to keep those Jews...out of here.""
For much of its history, Airmont has been under investigation, in litigation or under some sort of federal oversight. Its very creation, said Audrey Strauss, the acting attorney for New York's Southern District, has its roots in animus against Orthodox Jews. Its incorporation came about because some locals wished to impose zoning restrictions to prevent the growing ultra-Orthodox Jewish population from worshipping together at home.
Since federal oversight expired in 2015, the latest lawsuit says, the village has doubled down on discriminatory land-use zoning. The government claims the village unlawfully prevented the approval of an Orthodox Jewish school's expansion. Airmont implemented an 18-month villagewide moratorium on development, which the lawsuit claims was targeted at the Orthodox Jewish community. When the moratorium expired in 2018, the filing claims land-use laws were amended and applied arbitrarily. Jewish homeowners were prohibited from installing mikvahs, ritual baths used for religious observances.
Several rabbis jointly filed suit in a federal court in 2018. The case is pending. Their lawyer, Keisha Russell of First Liberty, a not-for-profit firm that specialises in religious-discrimination cases, said one client spent $50,000 over two years trying to get approval for a home extension.
For the past decade the ultra-Orthodox (particularly the Hasidic) population has been growing in towns in upstate New York and neighbouring New Jersey. Many of the arrivals were priced out of their old neighbourhoods in gentrified Brooklyn. The surging numbers and their demands for land have often put them at odds with locals. After battles over zoning and lawsuits, voters in nearby Monroe agreed in 2017 to allow a Jewish enclave to secede from the surrounding town to create a new town called Palm Tree. There, most wanted to replicate city life, living close together in multifamily dwellings.
But most Orthodox Jews in Airmont live in single-family homes on large lots on quiet streets. Yehuda Zorger, a community activist, for instance, left Brooklyn in 2014 for Airmont's suburban lifestyle. He says it has reached the point where even having extended family help fix his deck might draw the wrath of code enforcement. Had he known Airmont's history before he moved there, he says, he would have looked elsewhere for his coveted suburban lifestyle. Now, he is not going anywhere."

NEW YORK
A review of one of America's biggest bases may change the army's culture
Vanessa guillén, a 20-year-old soldier, told her mother she had been sexually harassed for months by higher-ranking soldiers at her Fort Hood army base in Texas. She had refrained from reporting it out of fear of retaliation. Not satisfied with the army's response to her disappearance in April, her family told local lawmakers and media that she had been harassed by superiors. Two months after she went missing, her dismembered body was found buried near a river 20 miles from the base. It later emerged that one of the harassing soldiers allegedly murdered her.
The hashtag #IAmVanessaGuillén, a military version of #MeToo, went viral. Service members and veterans shared their stories of sexual harassment and assault in the army. President Donald Trump vowed to help the family. In recent years Fort Hood's reputation has suffered as a result of sexual assaults, suicides, murders and two mass shootings as well as busts for prostitution and child-sex rings. Spurred by the outcry over Guillén's death and public awareness of violence at the base, Ryan McCarthy, the army secretary, commissioned an independent review of Fort Hood's leadership.
The mostly civilian panel released its scathing report on December 8th. It found that Fort Hood's commanders fostered a ""permissive environment"", which allowed sexual assault, harassment and violence to go unchecked. The panel called for staffing changes and better programmes to protect soldiers. In response, the army removed or suspended 14 military leaders, including the major-general who headed Fort Hood at the time of Guillén's disappearance.
Fort Hood has much higher rates of violent sex crimes than other posts-75% higher than the army overall. As far back as 2014 the base was identified as a high-risk installation for sexual assault. The report said Fort Hood's commanders did little to tackle the spectrum of criminal incidents. That led to underreporting of sex crimes. Like Guillén, victims feared retaliation as well as ostracism and career damage. Queta Rodriguez, a former marine who served on the committee, called the number of unreported sex crimes at Fort Hood ""shocking"". The committee discovered 93 credible accounts of sexual assault among the 507 women it interviewed. Of those, only 59 were reported. Of the 217 accounts of sexual harassment, only half were reported.
The panel found an extremely high number of suicides, but because the post's criminal investigators were inexperienced and under-resourced, contributing causes were not always examined. Fort Hood has the highest drug-test failure rate in the army. Local police describe the base as having a ""thriving drug culture"", but little seems to have been done about it. The report also criticised the inadequate procedures for missing soldiers, especially when there are suspicious circumstances. The absent soldier is often labelled a deserter. More than two dozen soldiers have gone missing or died since the start of the year, including Gregory Morales, a murdered private who the army assumed went awol. His body was found near Fort Hood by investigators looking for Vanessa Guillén.
The panel made 70 recommendations. Nearly half are aimed at combating sexual harassment and assault. It also recommended new procedures for missing soldiers. In response, Mr McCarthy announced that the army would take immediate action when soldiers are reported missing and formed a task force to map out a plan to tackle the problems identified in the review. Although the report focused on Fort Hood, he said, its conclusions will have army-wide implications. He predicted that the findings ""will cause the army to change our culture"".
Fort Hood's dysfunction is not unique, says Don Christensen, the air force's former chief prosecutor who heads Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group. Sexual harassment and retaliation cut across all services, from small air-force bases to naval ships. ""It takes a crisis to move the ball forward,"" he says. Joe Biden, the presidentelect, has said he would take a hard line against sexual abusers in the forces.
It is rare for the army to allow an independent review. Its findings are a wake-up call not just for the army, but for Congress, too, which has a history of being hesitant in pushing for change in the armed forces. Guillén's family hopes Congress will pass the I Am Vanessa Guillén Act, which would allow outside investigators to handle military sexual misconduct."

How much stimulus is enough?
In the spring America passed economic-rescue measures worth $2.3trn this year (11% of gdp), a larger injection than in any other big, rich country. With a slowing economy, almost everyone agrees that more is required, yet for the past six months Congress has squabbled over a new bill. Democrats pushed for a deal worth over $2trn in 2021; Republicans insisted on far lower amounts. As The Economist went to press, it looked as though an agreement might be in the offing. How much extra money is needed?
To answer that question requires estimating two things: the size of the ""output gap"" and the ""fiscal multiplier"". Both are as hard to quantify as they are to translate into plain English. The output gap measures the difference between the actual level of economic output and the amount the economy is capable of producing. Official data suggest that the gap was over 3% of gdp in the third quarter of the year, but it has almost certainly narrowed since then. Other economists estimate the gap using data on unemployment. A rule of thumb is that it is twice the difference between actual unemployment (6.7%) and full employment (with a jobless rate of perhaps 3.5%), which points to a figure of about 6% of gdp.
A stimulus package should aim to fill the output gap. But fiscal spending does not necessarily translate one-forone into increases in gdp. Estimating this ""fiscal multiplier"" is also tricky. Analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a publicpolicy organisation, suggests a multiplier of about 0.6 during the pandemic, meaning that $1 of government spending translates into 60 cents of output. Many people saved rather than spent their stimulus cheques, for instance. They might be less cautious today, however, in part because more shops and restaurants are open now.
Assume that the output gap is halfway between the gdp measure and the unemployment measure-4% or so- and that the multiplier is around one. If so, a package of $900bn-$1trn in 2021 would probably do the trick (further measures will almost certainly be needed in 2022 and beyond). But anyone pressing for a bigger or smaller stimulus can come up with their own, also plausible, estimates."

Seventy years ago this month, Mao Zedong's peasant army inflicted one of the worst military defeats on America in the country's history. Over two weeks his ""volunteer"" fighters drove an army of 350,000 American soldiers and marines and their Korean allies the length of North Korea, from the Chinese border to hasty evacuations by land and sea. Though the Chinese suffered terrible casualties in the process and the war would continue for another three years (and technically has not ended), the American-led un force never again threatened to reunify the peninsula.
This humiliation was made worse by the fact that General Douglas MacArthur, the force's megalomaniacal supremo, had only weeks before assured Harry Truman that the Chinese would not cross the Yalu river. His commanders duly denied that they had. When that became incredible, they claimed the cruelly illequipped Chinese-wearing cotton uniforms and canvas shoes for a high-altitude war fought at minus 30°C-were not a serious foe. An American general called them ""a bunch of laundrymen"".
It was classic superpower hubris, deserving of the contempt expressed by Xi Jinping at a grand 70th-anniversary event in October. Having emerged victorious from the second world war, with fewer casualties than any other major participant (America's covid death-toll is almost equal to its second-world-war combat toll), America in 1950 had a dangerous sense of impregnability, a racially infused contempt for Asian capability and a few generals with absurdly inflated status, including MacArthur. It might seem little wonder that America, consumed by the contemporary embarrassment of its president's effort to steal an election, is barely commemorating its first and only war with China.
That does not denote shame, however. Notwithstanding Americans' dewy-eyed view of their forces, public knowledge of their victories and defeats is similarly thin. American schools do not teach much military history and democracies do not mobilise people through a militaristic view of the past. In the case of the Korean war, the first ""limited"" war of the nuclear age, before that concept was well-understood, the forgetting has merely been especially pronounced. Yet the war retains cautionary lessons for both sides.
On one level it encapsulated the superpower's enduring ability to self-correct. This was apparent even amid the debacle-as illustrated by the battlefield recollections Lexington heard this week from Jack Luckett, a 91-year-old retired marine. He was occupying a ridge above Chosin Reservoir, close to the northernmost point of MacArthur's advance, on the night of November 27th 1950. Awakened by explosions, he saw a column of Chinese-eight men across-advancing in the glow of the defensive flares they had triggered. ""We were vastly outnumbered,"" he said. ""We opened fire but they kept on coming. They were blowing bugles and firing on us while pouring down both sides of the ridge.""
Mao's intelligence chiefs had assured him that, for all their superior technology, American soldiers lacked the belly for a fight. The ensuing 17-day battle, which Mr Luckett fought through until frostbite laid him low, gave the lie to that. Surrounded by 120,000 Chinese, the 1st Marine Division broke out and made a heroic fighting retreat through the frozen mountains. The marines-and a small British contingent fighting alongside them-suffered terrible casualties; only 11 of Mr Luckett's company of 250 survived unscathed. Yet they evacuated their wounded and equipment while inflicting a far heavier toll on the Chinese. Mr Luckett's marine division was reckoned to have disabled seven Chinese ones.
For a military institution whose small size, relative to the us army, has fuelled a tradition of mythologising and introspection, ""Frozen Chosin"" ranks alongside ""Iwo Jima"" in importance. ""It's not an overstatement to say marines credit the marines who fought in Korea with ending the debate about whether there should be a marine corps,"" says General Joseph Dunford, a former marine-corps commandant (and recently retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff). His father celebrated his 20th birthday at Chosin reservoir on the day of the Chinese attack.
In the soul-searching that followed the American retreat, notes Max Hastings, a British historian, it is possible to see a familiar debate about the kind of superpower America should be. Deaf to the entreaties of allies, MacArthur refused to accept the limits to American power that his incompetence had helped display. He wanted to nuke the Chinese. Truman resisted and, after MacArthur sneakily appealed to his Republican backers in Congress, sacked the revered general. It may have cost him a second term. It also set a gold standard for civil-military relations that has since prevailed.
Truman's multilateralism and restraint were also vindicated when his Republican successor, Dwight Eisenhower, maintained his conduct of the war. Better military leadership had by then stabilised the situation. America and China would both settle for their initial aims: respectively, securing South Korea, which would become one of the big successes of the late 20th century, and securing a Korean buffer against America's presence in Asia. America lost 40,000 lives in the process; China maybe ten times as many.
First know your enemy
That Americans are not more interested in this momentous past ultimately reflects their restless democracy, which is too consumed by contemporary dramas to dwell on history. Current appearances notwithstanding, it is the source of American strength. Yet it is important to underline two lessons from America's war with China. In a fog of misunderstanding, each side fatally underestimated the other. And each had a flawed idea of the other's red lines, the tripwires that turn competition into conflict. The situation today might look very different. The two countries' interdependence and mutual awareness are on another plane. But their potential for underestimation and misunderstanding is still hauntingly present; and perhaps growing with their rivalry. *"

MANAGUA
To have any chance of defeating Daniel Ortega in an election next year, the opposition must unite now
Cloaked in a hoodie, Camila found herself bellowing anti-government slogans along with scores of other people at a crossroads in Managua, Nicaragua's capital, in April 2018. The protest was part of la crisis, which began in reaction to a proposal to cut pension benefits. In putting it down, the regime killed perhaps 450 people. Camila (not her real name) feared she would be spotted by government agents scanning the crowd. As repression mounted, she fled from Nicaragua. Neighbours, part of the regime's network of local spies, later stopped by her family's home to ask after her. Camila now studies in Europe. She will not go back, she says, until Daniel Ortega, the regime's leader, is out of power.
Veterans of la crisis will have a chance to remove him in a presidential election scheduled for November 2021. In a fair vote Mr Ortega, who has held power without interruption since 2007, would probably lose it. But he has long stopped practising fairness. The opposition is energised and determined-but also divided. If it is to put up a respectable fight, it will have to settle its differences and find a leader soon.
John Bolton, a national security adviser under Donald Trump, branded Nicaragua's regime and those of Cuba and Venezuela as a left-wing ""troika of tyranny"". But Nicaragua is in some ways an exception. Mr Ortega's revolutionary credentials are impeccable. His Sandinista Liberation Front overthrew the United States-backed Somoza dictatorship in 1979. He governed the country until he lost an election in 1990. But he is more an opportunist than an ideologue. During his second stint in power, even as Nicaragua took billions of dollars from Venezuela, he formed an alliance with business and wooed the Catholic church by supporting family values and anti-abortion legislation. Although the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions against officials and institutions after the crackdown in 2018, Nicaragua is not quite the pariah in the West that Venezuela is. The imf agreed to lend it $185m to cope with the pandemic.
Mr Ortega's friends let him rig elections and take control of courts, the electoral authority and the media. He governs with Rosario Murillo, who is both first lady and vice-president. The duo delivered political stability. Economic growth helped pay for benefits, such as tin roofs, for the poor.
But when aid from Venezuela dried up the government had to make painful reforms, including the pension cuts that sparked la crisis. The unrest hurt business confidence and tourism, causing the economy to shrink by a seventh since 2017. The number of formal jobs had fallen by a fifth, even before the pandemic struck.
When it did, the Ortega government was complacent. Before Nicaragua had confirmed cases, Ms Murillo held a rally for ""love in the time of covid-19"" to show solidarity with less fortunate countries. Nicaragua responded to the pandemic's onset with the world's laxest containment measures, according to a stringency index put together by Oxford University. The death toll, officially 162, is 6,000-7,500, according to an analysis by Confidencial, a newspaper, of extra deaths attributed to diabetes, pneumonia and heart attacks. Two hurricanes that struck in November left thou- sands of Nicaraguans homeless (see Bello).
Mr Ortega's popularity has plummeted. His odds of re-election depend on the coherence of the opposition, and how much he is willing and able to undermine the integrity of the vote.
The opposition that burst into life in 2018 lacked leaders and organisation. Those emerged when Mr Ortega convened a dialogue as a way to buy time. Students, businessfolk and think-tankers founded the Civic Alliance. A peasants' movement, formed earlier in the decade, took part in the dialogue. Blue and White National Unity (unab), a grouping of more than 100 student and civil-society outfits, sprang up after the talks.
These groups all want to restore democracy and obtain justice for the victims of the crackdown. They are not natural partners. unab worries about inequality. ""We see crony capitalism as part of the problem,"" says unab's leader, Félix Maradiaga. The Civic Alliance prioritises a quick economic rebound. Mistrust within the opposition is rife, partly because almost everyone has at some point dealt with Mr Ortega.
In January its separate elements joined to form a National Coalition. The Civic Alliance left nine months later, angry that a party in the coalition had come under the regime's sway. (It now has new leaders.)
To have any hope in November's election the opposition will need to unite. A candidate needs only a plurality to win. In an opinion poll in June, no opposition figure was mentioned as the probable winner by more than 13% of respondents. ""We lack a messiah,"" says Juan Sebastián Chamorro, the head of the Civic Alliance. The opposition has until June to register a candidate as the nominee of a party (perhaps the small independent Citizens for Liberty).
Contenders include Mr Maradiaga, Mr Chamorro and Medardo Mairena, the peasants' leader. It is not clear how the choice will be made. In a stalemate Cristiana Chamorro, Mr Chamorro's cousin and the daughter of Violeta Chamorro, who succeeded Mr Ortega in 1990, could become the opposition's standard bearer. Managua's magnates would back her.
Mr Ortega is already harassing his would-be opponents. Mr Maradiaga says he has lost three drivers in three months because the police confiscated their licences. Last year Mr Mairena was convicted of attempting to overthrow the government and sentenced to 216 years in prison, where he was tortured. He was eventually pardoned. Mr Ortega may not allow any credible candidate to challenge him.
The government has recently enacted laws that would mete out prison sentences for spreading ""fake news"" (as the regime defines it) and brand as ""foreign agents"" ngos that get money from abroad. Under a new law, perpetrators of ""hate crimes"" can be jailed for life. Opposition politicians fear it will be used against them.
But Mr Ortega is reluctant to steal elections as flagrantly as his friend, Nicolás Maduro, who on December 6th arranged for Venezuela's ruling party to wrest control of the legislature from the opposition. Without Venezuela's largesse and oil reserves of its own, Nicaragua has turned to Western financial institutions. The imf loan is part of nearly $1bn in credits for coping with the pandemic and hurricane damage. (At the insistence of the United States, the un and other bodies will administer most of that money.) Brazen electoral fraud would invite tough sanctions from the incoming Biden administration. Full pariah status would further alienate the tycoons who run much of the economy.
For these reasons Mr Ortega may offer olive branches. They could include the release of the 100-odd remaining political prisoners and electoral reform. The crafty president will need to strike the right balance. Too little fairness may provoke isolation and another uprising. Too much may lead to his defeat. The opposition hopes to exploit any miscalculation.
It must overcome voters' scepticism as well as Mr Ortega's manoeuvring. The opposition ""represent their own interest"", says Camila, the hooded protester. Unity might help correct that impression. It will be needed, even if Mr Ortega, who is 75, wins. Nicaragua will still require a robust opposition as a bridge to the eventual return of democracy.
Democracy alone may not heal Nicaragua's wounds. When Camila contemplates returning, she wonders: ""How do I live with my neighbour who came down to look for me?"" *"

A Cuban student finds a way to extend the shelf life of dulce de leche
Cubans love dulce de leche. The confection of thickened, sweetened milk is an ingredient of popular desserts, including tarta de tres leches (three-milk cake) and alfajores. In a country where fresh milk is scarce, it is sold in the form of solid bars, a sugary way to get a bit of milk protein.
But the bars do not stand up well to Cuba's heat and humidity. Mould and yeast spot them, often well before the sell-by date. So it was cause for excitement when Adriana Rodríguez, a student of chemical biology, reported in her master's thesis that she had solved the spoilage problem. Her research was prompted by complaints from shoppers at stores supplied by Granlac, a state-run dairy firm, which employs her. After two years of experimenting she concluded that the admixture of potassium sorbate, a common preservative, as 0.11% of the product's weight would increase its shelf life from a promised seven days to 30. The new recipe also made the bars harder, and therefore less prone to crumble. La Demajagua, a state-run newspaper, broke the news in November and other newspapers followed. Production of long-life dulce de leche is on its way.
This is a rare success in a long and mostly thwarted quest to satisfy Cubans' craving for dairy foods. In a speech in 2007 Raúl Castro, then the country's president, declared: ""We must produce enough milk so that any Cuban who wishes to drink a glass of it can."" His brother, Fidel Castro, the founder of Cuba's revolution, loved ice cream almost as much as cigars. In a foreword to a book based on interviews with Fidel, Gabriel García Márquez recounts a Sunday afternoon during which, after a large lunch, the leader gobbled 18 scoops. He also liked to quaff chocolate milkshakes at the Havana Libre hotel. In 1963 the cia took advantage of this weakness by attempting to poison one. The plot failed because the pill to be slipped into Castro's shake froze to the wall of the hotel's freezer.
Undaunted, Fidel made dairy goods a symbol of the revolution. He wanted to prove that Cuba could churn ice cream as well as the Americans, and outdo the French in making Camembert. In the 1960s Coppelia, a sprawling outdoor ice-cream parlour in downtown Havana, served 50 flavours to 35,000 customers a day.
But the island's Creole and Zebu cows were lacklustre lactators. Fidel ordered the import of Holsteins from Canada, but many perished in Cuba's heat. Government breeders tried mating Holsteins with Zebus, hoping to create hardy milk cows. Just one of their offspring lived up to Fidel's hopes. Ubre Blanca (""White Udder"") set Guinness world records for daily and seasonal milk production. When she was slaughtered in 1985, aged 13, Granma, the Communist Party's newspaper, published a full-page obituary.
Dairy disaster deepened in 1990, after the former East Germany halted food shipments to the island and the Soviet Union cut back on deliveries of butter. Fidel famously chose to produce ice cream rather than butter, perhaps thinking it would bring relief to sweltering Cubans.
Things have not improved much. In October this year Marino Murillo Jorge, the economy and planning minister, said Cuba could import milk more cheaply than it could produce it. But since foreign currency is scarce, so is milk. Coppelia serves fewer flavours: vanilla, coffee, coconut and tiramisu, recalls a recent visitor. The only Cubans who can count on a daily glass of milk are those younger than seven, who get a serving through the ration-book system. For sweet-toothed adults there's dulce de leche, soon minus the mould. *"

It isa month since Central America was hit in quick succession by two hurricanes. Parts of northern Honduras are still under water: 50 bridges are down, and 120 roads and many hospitals and schools are still flooded. In all, some 200 people died and 7m were affected by the storms, most of them in Honduras and Guatemala, according to the un. Tens of thousands of homes were destroyed, and perhaps 175,000 people are living in makeshift shelters.
The hurricanes came at a bad time, amid the pandemic and its economic slump. Whereas in Guatemala and Nicaragua they struck rural areas, in Honduras they devastated the Sula valley, the country's economic heartland. The Honduran economy was already set to shrink by 7%, and unemployment had soared. Honduras, a country of 10m people, ""is now facing the greatest catastrophe in its history"", says Gina Kawas, a consultant at the Central American Bank for Economic Integration who is based in Tegucigalpa, the capital. Total damage is equivalent to 40% of gdp.
With livelihoods destroyed, the flow of migrants to the United States is likely to increase. So think the presidents of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, and Guatemala, Alejandro Giammattei. Both have cited the likelihood of increased migration when calling for North American help. ""If we don't want to see hordes of Central Americans looking to go to countries with a better quality of life, we have to create walls of prosperity in Central America,"" said Mr Giammattei.
This is realistic-and an implicit threat. Honduras and Guatemala are among the worst-governed countries in Latin America. They offer a caricature of the region's ills, of poverty, inequality, racism, corruption and the capture of the state by self-serving elites. Government spending in both countries is the lowest per person in the region, after only Haiti. Guatemala had protests in November over Mr Giammattei's budget, which cut education spending while lavishing money on insiders. Mr Hernández faced protests in 2017, when opponents accused him of fraudulently winning a second term.
Millions of Guatemalans and Hondurans have fled violence, poverty and climate change (which has hurt farming). Rather than raising taxes on the better-off to spend on health, education, security, disaster preparedness and climate-change mitigation, the rulers of both countries have preferred to rely on remittances from the leavers, which account for 22% of gdp in Honduras and 14% in Guatemala. Governments kicked out international bodies set up to tackle corruption and organised crime in both countries. Prosecutors in New York say Mr Hernández took a bribe from a drug-trafficker (he denies this). His brother was convicted of drug-trafficking by a court in New York in 2019.
Although a relief effort is under way in Honduras, it is ""patchy"", says George Redman of Oxfam, a British charity. He points out that not only was the government unprepared-just weeks before the hurricanes it appointed a reggaeton singer with no relevant experience to head its disaster-relief organisation-but that the presence of street gangs complicates aid distribution.
Donors face a dilemma. The need is huge, but so is corruption. The former director of Invest-H, a supposedly corruption-proof agency that implements foreign-financed projects, is being investigated over misuse of foreign loans during the pandemic. Central America will thus be an immediate problem for Joe Biden's administration in the United States. Arrivals at the southern border have risen since the covid-19 recession began. The new administration ""will have to balance a desire for a more humanitarian approach [to immigration] with protecting the border"", says an American official who has worked on Central America. ""It's a challenge and it's going to come quickly,"" he says.
Mr Biden has promised a $4bn plan to deal with the root causes of migration from Central America. This builds on a scheme he promoted when he was vicepresident. It aims to strengthen the rule of law and democratic governance, partly by helping local anti-corruption campaigners and prosecutors, who have had some success. The need for foreign help for reconstruction should offer leverage for reform. One idea is to set up an international body to work with local public auditors to track spending. But Honduras and Guatemala need political change, rather than just protest or individual efforts. Sadly, this is not on the horizon. That is a problem for the United States, as well as for the countries themselves."

KABWE
A class-action lawsuit shines light on a polluted town
Azael tembo takes a seat in the shade of a mango tree outside his house. He kicks up the dust. ""It's affected,"" he says, pointing to the plume around his feet. The 67-year-old lives in Kabwe, a town in central Zambia whose history, like that of much of the southern African country, is intertwined with mining. Kabwe sprung up around a mine founded in 1904 by the Rhodesian Broken Hill Development Company, a British colonial firm. For decades miners like Mr Tembo crushed and burnt ore to extract lead. That metal made Kabwe but it also devastated it. To this day lead particles blow across town, making their way into houses and bloodstreams.
Scientists generally consider soil hazardous if it has more than 400mg of lead per kilogram. In three townships near the old mine the soil contains six, eight and 15 times that amount, according to analysis in 2014 by Pure Earth, an environmental ngo. ""Kabwe is the most toxic place I've ever been to,"" says Richard Fuller, its president.
Prolonged exposure to lead degrades the body's nervous and circulatory systems, damaging the brain and other organs. It is associated with higher rates of miscarriage, convulsions, comas and death. Mr Tembo believes his poor eyesight and sore limbs are from lead poisoning.
But his main concern is for his four grandchildren, in particular the two-yearold. She enjoys playing outside and is puckishly recalcitrant when told to stop putting things in her mouth. ""I tell her mum to not let her eat the soil, but kids do what they will do,"" he says. Children are more likely to inhale and ingest toxic dust. Their bodies are more susceptible to its potential effects, such as behavioural problems, learning disabilities and lower iqs.
Three-quarters of Kabwe's population are estimated to have more than five micrograms of lead per decilitre in their blood, levels scientists consider elevated. Among children the average levels are much higher (see chart on next page). ""Kabwe is the most polluted place for children on the planet,"" says Jack Caravanos of the nyu School of Global Public Health.
The pollution in Kabwe is a scandal. Yet responsibility for it has long been contested, and that is set to continue. In October Mbuyisa Moleele Attorneys, a South African law firm, with help from Leigh Day, a British one, announced a class-action lawsuit against a subsidiary of Anglo American on behalf of potentially more than 100,000 children and women of reproductive age in Kabwe. It is targeting Anglo because it was affiliated to the mine from the 1920s until shortly after Zambia's mines were nationalised in 1970.
The suit claims that most of the pollution stems from the period when the mine was under the de facto control of Anglo, which allegedly did not do enough to stop the harm. Anglo rejects the claims, arguing that its involvement ended five decades ago and that, before then, it was neither the operator nor a majority shareholder in the mine and thus not responsible.
The case may take years. The lawyers for the plaintiffs must first convince a South African court to take it on. Only then may it proceed to a trial. Meanwhile children in Kabwe will keep on playing in the dust.
There have been attempts to make Kabwe less dangerous. The first concerted efforts came in the 1990s, when Zambia's state-owned mining company conducted blood testing and provided some topsoil to cover toxic yards. But these efforts were woefully inadequate; according to Mr Fuller of Pure Earth, the government also claimed that sick residents had malaria and prescribed milk to children.
After cajoling from Mr Fuller, the World Bank included Kabwe in a broader project it funded to clean up Zambian mines. (To get Zambian officials on board, the Bank's representative had them watch ""Erin Brockovich"", a film in which Julia Roberts plays a lawyer representing victims of pollution.) The scheme, which ran from 2003-11, had some successes. It dredged a toxic canal and buried some contaminated soil. But it did not treat the main source of the dust- the former mine and dumps-and it left roads unpaved and most houses untreated. Cornelius Katiti, a local councillor at the time, reckons that just 10% of houses had topsoil replaced. An independent evaluation of the project commissioned by the World Bank found various shortcomings.
Another clean-up funded by the bank was started in December 2016. But it, too, is struggling. Some children have been tested and have received therapy to reduce blood lead levels. But since little has been done about the lead in the environment there is a risk their levels will rise again. ""If this were in London, Johannesburg or a rich suburb of Lusaka it would not happen like this,"" says Juliane Kippenberg of Human Rights Watch, an international ngo.
At the project office in Kabwe officials refuse to talk to your correspondent. When asked if nothing has been done to remediate the area, one worker replies: ""It depends on your definition of nothing."" Later, in the capital, Lusaka, the director of the project, Gideon Ndalama, concedes that it has had a ""slow start"", arguing that there is not enough money to do a full job.
More than 25 years after the mine closed, its huge waste dump-known as Black Mountain-looms. Artisanal miners cart away maize sacks filled with rocks.
In the absence of a clear plan that will end contamination in Kabwe, residents are trying to protect themselves as best they can. Local ngos such as Environment Africa are educating people in schools and on radio shows. Families pass on warnings. ""I don't let my younger brothers play outside,"" says Joy Mbuzi, a 19-year-old student, whose grandfather, a former miner, drummed into her the dangers of lead. ""I'm worried about their iqs,"" she says.
In his front yard Mr Tembo introduces his son, Richard. ""All these years I've been affected,"" says the 20-year-old. He struggles to focus on his college work and suffers from memory loss. He worries about his younger nieces and their difficulties at school. Given all this, hasn't his father considered leaving Kabwe? He doesn't have the money, says Mr Tembo. ""This is our home. We've nowhere else to go."""

DAKAR
The president wins another term, but his party takes a hit
After a prayer, the electoral commission announced that Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, had won another four years in office in national elections held on December 7th. His supporters cheered in the streets. But his victory is far from comprehensive.
Mr Akufo-Addo's margin shrank and his party suffered heavy losses in the parliament. About 30 seats were flipped, leaving the house split almost evenly between the two major parties. (As The Economist went to a press a handful were still in the balance.) The main opposition candidate and former president, John Mahama, was yet to concede. His party rejected the result, alleging irregularities without providing evidence of any. Few expect it to challenge the results in the streets, even if it does take them to court. Yet the moment the dust has settled, Ghana will face tough economic choices. Its public debt, already high, is climbing fast. Dealing with it may be even harder if, as remains possible, power is split between the executive president and an opposition-controlled parliament.
Mr Akufo-Addo's win owes plenty to his government's popular decision in 2017 to make senior high school education free. Voters also backed his handling of covid-19, which included generous handouts. Preelection surveys showed he was trusted for his management of the economy.
Set against this, though, is the view among many voters that his government has failed at reducing corruption, says Emmanuel Gyimah-Boadi of Afrobarometer, a pan-African research group. Shortly before the election the independent special prosecutor for corruption, Martin Amidu, resigned citing political interference. Voters, especially in the capital, Accra, were unimpressed, swinging their support from the president to his opponent. The swing might have been wider still, had Mr Mahama not been tainted by corruption scandals from his time in office.
Voters seemingly punished rulingparty mps by voting against them while still supporting the president's bid. This was because they are seen as having failed to build things like roads or clinics in their constituencies, says Bright Simons of Imani, a local think-tank. In about 20 constituencies the opposition's parliamentary candidate won office, even as their leader lost the presidential vote.
""Skirt-and-blouse"" voting, as such splits are called in Ghana, suggests that voters are discerning in their exercise of democratic power. This may be because of experience: Ghana has held elections since 1992, with power regularly changing hands. That has made it a beacon in the region.
Yet Ghana's democracy is not without troubles. More than 62,000 soldiers and police officers were deployed. Even so, five people were killed on election day and the day after. Political violence has been rising since 2012 and the number of Ghanaians who say they fear becoming victims of it increased by eight percentage points to 43% between 2014 and 2018.
Elections also usually add to the country's economic woes. Those in power in Ghana almost always splurge heavily in the year before voters get to make their choice. This is often followed by an imf bail-out; Ghana finished its 16th in 2019. Perhaps trying to tie itself to the mast, the New Patriotic Party (npp) government introduced a rule in 2018 limiting budget deficits to 5% of gdp. But the imf forecasts a deficit of 16.4% for 2020, the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Covid-19 explains some of this. But the limit would have been exceeded anyway, says Henry Telli, a Ghana-based economist for the International Growth Centre of the London School of Economics.
Worse, Ghana was already at high risk of debt distress before covid-19 hit. It spends and borrows like a middle-income country, but does not collect revenue like one, says Greg Smith of m&g, an asset manager. It scrapes together tax revenue of about 14% of gdp, which is low even for similar African countries. For the next few years Ghana is likely to spend half of its revenue on interest payments. There are other troubles, too. A big new offshore oilfield, Pecan, was expected to boost growth. But this has been delayed amid lower oil prices.
Mr Akufo-Addo made bold promises on the campaign trail, from building more than a hundred hospitals to adding railway lines. If he wants parliament to pass his budgets, he may have to agree to pork-barrel side-deals with mps. Yet if the new government cannot set a credible plan to cut spending-and stick to it- it will lose credibility with lenders. And that, says Mr Telli, could see the imf back again."

DUBAI
The Gulf states are trying to make nice, but a real end to their dispute is far off
Months after four Arab states imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, a minister from the emirate made what he thought was a controversial comparison. ""To be honest, we consider ourselves like Israel,"" he said, referring to another small country isolated in the region. Improbably, almost three years later, this comparison seems too favourable to Qatar. Thousands of Israelis are visiting Dubai for the first time this December, while Qataris are nowhere to be found. Israel will soon have ambassadors to two of the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (gcc), the same number as Qatar-a gcc member.
The feud in the Gulf has long seemed intractable. But for the umpteenth time foreign officials are trying to resolve it. Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser (pictured, in blue mask), recently visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar to push for a deal. The Saudi foreign minister later said one was ""within reach"". Qatari officials made encouraging noises too. Yet even if they promise to bury the hatchet, real reconciliation will remain out of reach.
In 2017 the ""Arab quartet"" behind the blockade-Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (uae)- served Qatar a list of 13 demands, among them closing Al Jazeera, the satellite broadcaster; cutting ties with Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood; and shutting a Turkish military base in Doha, Qatar's capital. Qatar acceded to none of them and sometimes did the opposite, escalating its media war with the blockading states and deepening ties with Turkey.
American officials want the quartet to start by reopening their air space. That would fix a self-defeating facet of the embargo. The blockading states want Qatar to cut ties with Iran, yet by forcing dozens of Qatari planes to fly new routes over Iran each day they gifted it hundreds of millions of dollars in overflight fees. Reopening the air space would be progress, but hardly a reconciliation.
Mr Kushner, who will be out of a job next month, did not offer much to accelerate a deal. Nor is it clear what Qatar would offer the quartet in return. Buoyed by the world's third-largest proven natural-gas reserves, its economy grew in 2017 and 2018 despite the embargo. It feels no pressure to make big concessions. A small one would be to quieten Al Jazeera, where the tone of the Arabic-language channel is often a bellwether for relations between Qatar and its neighbours. Beyond that, Qatar may offer the promise of a less antagonistic relationship. In other words, not much.
That might still appease Saudi Arabia. The blockade has upset America, a close partner of both Qatar and the quartet. Steps to end the dispute would curry favour with the incoming Biden administration. Some of Saudi Arabia's partners are less conciliatory, though. Qatar remains a bugbear for Egypt because of its support for the Muslim Brotherhood. Less enthusiastic still is the uae, whose hostility towards political Islam puts it implacably at odds with Qatar. It has responded tepidly to the diplomacy.
Reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Qatar would add to a growing list of disagreements between Saudi Arabia and the uae. The Emiratis pulled out most of their troops from Yemen in 2019 and withdrew from the Saudi-led war there. They have grown nervous about Mr Trump's belligerent policy towards Iran, which the Saudis have encouraged. Recently they have split over oil: the uae is frustrated with Saudi-backed production caps imposed on members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Diplomatic niceties will not end the discord between the Qatari emir (pictured, in white) and the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the uae. And for all the talk of the ""brotherly"" Gulf states, the blockade has introduced a level of personal animosity in the region, particularly between Qataris and Emiratis. ""People had a big shock that disturbed and tortured the social fabric of our region,"" says a Qatari official. ""To go back to normal, I think we need two or three generations."" Even if Qataris can soon fly over Dubai, they may not be eager to land."

Five years after escaping Islamic State, the Yazidis are still struggling
Like a picture of purity in white robes, white shoes and a white turban, Ali Iliyas emerged from a candle-lit sanctum. He had just been inaugurated as the new Baba Sheikh, or spiritual leader of the Yazidis, on November 18th. Believers gathered at Lalish, a temple in Iraqi Kurdistan, banging drums and tootling flutes to celebrate.
But behind the scenes an unholy row is blazing between Yazidi leaders. The Asayish, or Kurdish police, had to intervene after scuffles broke out at a gathering to announce the new leader. Many Yazidi elders boycotted the temple ceremony. For the first time in its history, the esoteric Yazidi religion faces a schism.
Six years ago Western armies saved the Yazidis from Islamic State (is). The jihadists killed 5,000 of their men and enslaved 5,000-7,000 of their women, mostly to rape. The genocide caused many Yazidis, who number perhaps 1m, to flee abroad. Inside Iraq new pressures are tearing the group apart.
Some Yazidis see themselves as part of the larger Kurdish community and have aligned themselves with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (kdp), which rules Kurdistan. But others blame the kdp for not stopping is. They objected when Mir Hazim Tahsin Beg, a former kdp parliamentarian, was chosen as head of the Yazidis' spiritual council last year, believing he does the party's bidding. Nevertheless, it was Mir Hazim who chose the Baba Sheikh.
Many of the disgruntled Yazidis hail from Sinjar, home to a mountain the Yazidis consider holy (see map). Shia militias, the Iraqi army and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (pkk), which fights for Kurdish selfrule inside Turkey, hold sway in the area- not the kdp. A number of Yazidis went to Baghdad in October to meet the prime minister and to protest against Mir Hazim. ""He rules like a dictator,"" says one of them. Elders within this faction are trying to set up a more representative authority.
Many Muslims consider Yazidis to be devil-worshippers. The peacock etched on their buildings represents Lucifer, the angel cast from heaven-though in the Yazidi telling he is Malik Taous and has been restored to grace. In the summer Turkey, the region's most powerful Sunni state, bombed Sinjar, claiming the Yazidis had teamed up with the pkk, which Turkey considers a terrorist group. In the Turkishheld province of Afrin in Syria, militants have driven Yazidis from their homes and defaced their shrines.
About 40% of Yazidis are thought to have fled to the West. Isolated and cut off from their homeland, many lose their religion. Yazidi elders oppose writing oral traditions down or putting them online. Meanwhile, they rigidly uphold a ban on marrying out. Some children born of Yazidi women raped by is members are put out of the flock. Other strictures-such as the insistence on marrying inside the Yazidis' caste system-are impractical among tiny communities abroad. Falling short, many give up altogether. It is common to see Yazidis abroad wearing blue clothes, which is taboo back home.
A little bit of liberalism could solve a lot of these problems. The opponents of Mir Hazim might be satisfied if he accepted a broader and more consultative council. Yazidi elders could ease up on those rules that are all but impossible to follow-and they could start writing things down. Many Yazidis want other countries to help rebuild Sinjar and guarantee their protection. But they are not holding their breath. They cite 74 massacres in their history-and expect to keep counting."

JERUSALEM
...gets an Arab owner
Match day at Teddy stadium, home of Beitar Jerusalem, can get pretty nasty. Supporters of the football club proudly sing about how it is ""the most racist team"" in Israel. They scream epithets, such as ""terrorist"", at the Arabs who play for opposing squads. Though Arabs make up 21% of Israel's population, Beitar Jerusalem has never itself fielded one, in keeping with fans' claim to be ""forever pure"". After the club signed two Muslim players from Chechnya in 2013, a group of fans burned down its offices. When one of the Chechens scored his first goal, many Beitar supporters walked out of the stadium. The players soon moved on.
But on December 7th the Holy Land received proof that God has a sense of irony, as Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Nahyan purchased a 50% stake in Beitar Jerusalem. Sheikh Hamad is an Arab Muslim. He is also a cousin of Muhammad bin Zayed, the crown prince and de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates (uae), which formally normalised diplomatic and other relations with Israel in September.
Some of Beitar Jerusalem's fans have protested against the deal, spray-painting on the stadium's walls that ""the war has just begun"". But their collective attitude had already been changing. A documentary called ""Forever Pure"", released in 2016, shone a spotlight on the club's more despicable supporters and caused shame among the rest. Moshe Hogeg, who bought the club in 2018 and remains a co-owner, pressed fans to change their racist lyrics. Most seem elated with Sheikh Hamad's promise to invest $100m over the next decade in the club, which hasn't won the league since 2008.
It helps that Israel's warmer ties with the Arab world are seen as the personal achievement of Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister and leader of the Likud party. Beitar Jerusalem was founded in 1936 by the youth wing of the Zionist-Revisionist movement, from which Likud descends. The club remains a bastion of working-class Mizrahi Jews, who emigrated to Israel from Arab lands. Encouraged by Mr Netanyahu, they tend to resent the old Ashkenazi elite that calls for compromise with the Palestinians. Likud bigwigs can often be seen glad-handing at Teddy stadium. Mr Netanyahu himself claims to be a lifelong supporter of Beitar Jerusalem.
That is perhaps one reason for Sheikh Hamad's purchase: it is an investment by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi in Israel's ruling party and its supporters. Mr Hogeg, a Jew of Moroccan and Tunisian descent, hopes it will also lead to more change. Eventually he would like to field Arab players. For now, though, he is relying on Jewish help. Before signing the deal he obtained the blessing of an Israeli ultraOrthodox rabbi. *"

TOKYO
Japan has had a milder epidemic than most countries, in part because health-care officials understood the disease better
When the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship suffering from an outbreak of covid-19, arrived in Japan in February, it seemed like a stroke of bad luck. A small floating petri dish threatened to turn the Japanese archipelago into a big one. In retrospect, however, the early exposure taught the authorities lessons that have helped make Japan's epidemic the mildest among the world's big economies, despite a recent surge in infections. In total 2,487 people have died of the coronavirus in Japan, just over half the number in China and fewer people than on a single day in America several times over the past week. Japan has suffered just 18 deaths per million people, a higher rate than in China, but by far the lowest in the G7, a club of big, industrialised democracies. (Germany comes in second, at 239.) Most strikingly, Japan has achieved this success without strict lockdowns or mass testing-the main weapons in the battle against covid-19 elsewhere.
""From the beginning we did not aim at containment,"" says Oshitani Hitoshi, a virologist who sits on an expert panel advising the government. That would require identifying all possible cases, which is not feasible in a country of Japan's size when the majority of infections produce mild or no symptoms, argues Mr Oshitani: ""Even if you test everyone once per week, you'll still miss some."" Japan performs the fewest tests in the G7: an average of 270 a day for every million people, compared with 4,000 or so in America and Britain (see chart on next page).
Instead, the government tried to apply the lessons of the Diamond Princess. After trained quarantine officers and nurses were infected aboard the ship, despite following protocols for viruses that spread through droplets, Mr Oshitani's team concluded that the virus spread through the air. As early as March, Japanese officials began warning citizens to avoid the san-mitsu or ""3cs"": closed spaces, crowded places and close-contact settings. The phrase was blasted across traditional and social media. Surveys conducted in the spring found that a big majority were avoiding 3c settings. The publishing house Jiyukokuminsha recently declared it ""buzzword of the year"" for 2020.
The Diamond Princess also inspired an early focus on clusters. The government set up a cluster-busting taskforce in March.
These insights allowed the authorities to make granular distinctions about risks, opting for targeted restrictions rather than swinging between the extremes of strict lockdowns and free-for-all openings. Nishimura Yasutoshi, the minister overseeing the government's response to covid-19, carries a device that monitors carbon dioxide to measure the quality of ventilation during his meetings. (The room where he and your correspondent meet registers 506 parts per million, safely below the threshold of 1000 ppm that indicates poor air flow. The interview takes place across a large table, behind plastic shields and with face masks on.)
Researchers deployed Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, to model different situations. Crowded subways pose little risk, if windows are open and passengers wear masks, Mr Nishimura insists. Sitting diagonally, rather than directly across from each other can reduce the risk of infection by 75%. Movie theatres are safe, ""even if viewers are eating popcorn and hot dogs"", Mr Nishimura says. While most cinemas in the West are closed, ""Demon Slayer"", a new anime flick, has been playing to full houses in Japan, becoming the country's second-highest grossing film ever. In addition to the 30s, the Japanese government warns of five more specific dangers: dinner parties with booze; drinking and eating in groups of more than four; talking without masks at close quarters; living in dormitories and other small shared spaces; and using changing or break rooms.
Of course, these insights would have been for naught if ordinary people had ignored them. But Japanese heeded the government's advice to stay home and to quarantine if showing any symptoms of the coronavirus, even though these admonitions carried no legal force. ""Sometimes we are criticised for being an overly homogeneous society, but I think it played a positive role this time,"" Mr Nishimura says. And already spick-and-span Japan became even more punctilious about hygiene. While Americans argued over whether face coverings were an assault on personal freedom, Japanese lined up outside Uniqlo for the release of its new line of masks. During the first ten weeks of flu season this autumn, Japan saw just 148 cases of common influenza, or less than 1% of the five-year average for the same period (17,000).
Better yet, although the population of Japan is disproportionally elderly, and therefore potentially more vulnerable to covid-19, it is also very healthy. Only 4.2% of Japanese adults are obese, a condition known to make the disease more lethal. That is the lowest rate in the oecd and a tenth of America's. Japan also has a good health-care system, with universal coverage and lots of well-equipped hospitals. It even had lots of already trained contacttracers, part of an established publichealth network dating back to the 1930s.
These advantages clearly have their limits. The virus has spread rapidly in recent weeks, reaching record highs in terms both of daily cases and daily deaths. The government has had to dispatch medical personnel from the Self-Defence Forces to shore up hospitals in the worst-hit spots. But at the same time it has discouraged caution with a scheme that subsidises domestic tourism and meals out, in an effort to help the economy. Although this seems to have contributed to covid-19's recent spread, the government has only curbed it rather than scrapping it. And cold weather is now pushing people into 30 spaces, as it has been across the northern hemisphere. But in Japan, at least, the recent growth in the number of cases has started from a dramatically lower base. *"

SEOUL
The number of young women killing themselves is rising
As of december 10th, 564 South Koreans had died of covid-19. Roughly twice that number died by suicide every month between January and September, the latest month for which data are available. Half as many again made the attempt and were saved by the emergency services.
High as these numbers are, they are mercifully much lower than a decade ago, when the suicide rate began to decline sharply. Unfortunately, this happy trend has recently gone into reverse (see chart). The reversal is largely driven by women in their teens, 20s and 30s. Between 2018 and 2019 the number of women in their 20s dying by suicide rose by a quarter as the number of men of the same age killing themselves stayed more or less constant. Data from the first three-quarters of 2020 suggest the suicide rate among young women is rising still more. What is going on?
In most rich and middle-income countries suicide rates have been low and declining in recent years. Though South Korea had begun to follow that trend, its people are more likely to kill themselves than those of any other oecd country except Lithuania. In 2019 there were 27 deaths from suicide for every 100,000 people, almost four times the number in Britain and nearly twice as many as in America. In other respects, however, South Korea follows global patterns: men and the elderly tend to be at higher risk of suicide than women and the young-making the increase in suicide among younger women all the more puzzling.
Sociologists tend to attribute the high overall rate to social and economic upheaval. They argue that rapid economic development combined with a clash between traditional social expectations and the individualism of modern life have plunged the country into the sort of confusion that Emile Durkheim, a 19th-century sociologist, called ""anomie"", in which conflicting social signals drive people to despair. That sort of tension may be particularly acute for young women in contemporary South Korea, says Timothy Kang of the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Having been brought up in the same competitive academic environment as their male peers, they then encounter discrimination in the workplace, sexist standards of beauty and pressure to marry and have children.
South Korean feminists argue that the pressure on women has been compounded in recent years by the use of the internet to propagate misogynistic views and to disseminate illicitly obtained images of women, often from spycams hidden in toilets and changing rooms. The country's vocal women's movement has faced an intemperate backlash from men who object to its demands. ""The relentlessness of the attacks is a big problem for women,"" says Shin Min-joo, an activist who has received plenty of online vitriol herself. The suicides in 2019 of two female celebrities following months of online trolling may have added to the trauma, she suggests.
Economic precariousness is another factor. Sluggish economic growth over the past few years has been harder on young women, who are more likely to be em- ployed in the service sector and on shortterm contracts. The pandemic has probably exacerbated these problems. The drop in the share of women in work this autumn compared with the year before has been three times bigger than that for men. ""The economic precarity and the social isolation that it causes are major problems for young women, particularly those living on their own,"" says Yun Kim Ji-yeong of Konkuk University in Seoul. In addition, women with families have borne the brunt of home-schooling kids and looking after vulnerable relatives during the pandemic. Past experience suggests that economic distress may raise the suicide rate: around the financial crisis in 2008, both young men and young women took their lives in greater numbers, with the rate among women exceeding that among men for several years.
The government is taking the problem more seriously than in the past. In a meeting on suicide prevention at the end of November, officials vowed to expand support for those at risk, particularly young women in precarious circumstances. The national suicide hotline, which has been understaffed, is recruiting more sympathetic ears. Public-information campaigns have tried to reduce the taboos around mental health in recent years, and the government has become a bit keener to combat sexism. All of this is welcome. But if rising suicide rates are indeed the result of rapid social change, a quick reprieve is unlikely."

MANILA
The trigger-happy president shows a softer side
The rattan sticks being issued to the Philippine National Police to keep people apart during the covid-19 epidemic are versatile, Lieutenant-General Cesar Binag explained: ""They will be one metre long, and will be used for enforcement, for measuring, or for hitting those that are hardheaded."" To critics of President Rodrigo Duterte, the announcement, on December 4th, was yet another sign of the brutality of his regime. The Commission on Human Rights, a state body, remarked drily: ""Violence, even in its slightest suggestion, is not the best way to address the pandemic."" Even Mr Duterte's own spokesman, Harry Roque, had to acknowledge that it would be against the law for a police officer to whack anybody with a stick without proper cause.
The police have demonstrated a great proclivity for violence during Mr Duterte's four-year-old war on illegal drugs. His campaign against both dealers and users has killed thousands of people. At least 5,903 of them, by the official count, have perished at the hands of the security services, guided by his exhortation to kill anybody who violently resists arrest. (Thousands more have been killed by unknown assailants.) Yet in the most recent of his frequent addresses to the nation Mr Duterte surprised his critics. Instead of ordering the police to crack heads if people failed to stay a metre apart, he gave a well-reasoned argument for the advantages of equipping the police with rattan sticks or, better still, proper batons, as a means to reduce their use of guns and thus stem bloodshed.
""When a person resists arrest and he becomes violent, the first impulse of a police without a baton is to hold his gun,"" he said. ""He might not draw it, but he holds his gun, ready for action. If he has a baton you just hit the hand, hit the body. It would be painful. Maybe you can subdue the person re- sisting arrest."" The president promised the police that he would issue them with proper batons, and told them: ""Use the baton, not the gun.""
Mr Duterte often goes on television to deliver rambling monologues about what his government is doing or what he wants it to do. These talks are replete with vituperation, threats and unfunny jokes. Ministers, members of Congress, civil servants and military or police officers appear alongside him, to voice their agreement with whatever he says. It is a ritual that many ordinary Filipinos find endearing, if a little too long-winded to be entertaining. But it is not just theatre: this seems to be how policy is made in Mr Duterte's Philippines-openly, on screen, evolving haphazardly from off-the-cuff remarks made by the president, which his subordinates must interpret as best they can.
Mr Roque is the chief interpreter of such remarks. The spokesman's mantra is that Mr Duterte's statements should be taken seriously, but not literally. Taking the president literally can have deadly consequences. In a televised speech on April 1st Mr Duterte urged the police and armed forces to shoot dead anyone in Manila breaking lockdown rules. Twenty days later a police officer enforcing the lockdown killed an ex-soldier who was being argumentative. The victim's behaviour may have been due to mental illness stemming from his military service. The police officer who fired the fatal shots was later charged with murder.
This episode may help to explain Mr Duterte's new enthusiasm for batons. And for once he put his ideas in plain words, which the police can take both seriously and literally, without fatal consequences."

The government finds houses for homeless crustaceans
Amid a slump in tourism, one national park in Thailand has seen a dramatic rise in visitors. So numerous are the hermit crabs thronging the otherwise empty beaches of Koh Lanta that shells for them to live in have become a scarce commodity. The Thai government moved quickly to ease the housing shortage, launching a public appeal for empty shells that netted over 200kg. On December 5th these were distributed around the park in a ceremony marking the birthday of the late king, Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Hermit crabs rely on discarded shells to protect their soft bodies, moving to larger shells as they grow. On Koh Lanta and the surrounding, smaller islands, their rapid increase seems to be a natural phenomenon, rather than directly related to the absence of tourists. But the shortage of shells may be man-made: pretty ones have long been gathered to be sold as souvenirs. Crabs had begun to make do with potential death-traps such as plastic caps and bottles.
The shell drive was part of a government initiative to ""restore the balance of nature"". ""I have instructed all national parks to do whatever it takes,"" says Varawut Silpa-archa, the minister for natural resources. His inspiration comes from the hiatus in tourism brought on by covid-19. A ban on international visitors (now lifted, subject to quarantine) and the closure of national parks have helped nature rebound, bringing black-tipped reef sharks back into Thai waters and endangered leatherback turtles back onto Thai beaches. In the coastal provinces of Phang Nga and Phuket, turtles have laid the largest number of eggs for 20 years.
The government has decided to try to mimic the respite forced on it by the coronavirus in future. From now on, all national parks will be required to close for part of the off-season and to limit the number of tourists through a reservation system when they are open. The temporary closure last year of Maya Bay, made famous as the eponymous strand in the film ""The Beach"" and subsequently overrun by tourists, set a precedent. Although such restrictions mean reduced earnings from tourism in the short term, in the longer run more pristine parks may help to keep the tourists coming-and shelling out."

The weeks of stand-off between young Thai activists and the establishment they are challenging have not been short of political theatre. The protesters are calling for the resignation of the army-backed prime minister, for open elections and, above all, for an absolutist monarchy to be modernised. They raise the three-finger salute of defiance from ""The Hunger Games"". Giant inflatable ducks lend their marches a carnival air-and also prove useful as protection against water cannon. And thousands of letters demanding that King Maha Vajiralongkorn accept limits to his power and wealth were delivered in replica post boxes to the very gates of the hallowed royal palace in Bangkok.
The monarchy in Thailand sits atop a cosmic hierarchy that demands order and obedience and offers beneficence. Never has it been challenged in this way before. Yet the king of four years, to whom even his most loyal supporters hesitate to attribute a great love of democracy, has betrayed no irritation and even slightly changed his ways.
A playboy resident in Germany, where he occupies a floor in an upscale Bavarian hotel with a shifting harem of ""sex soldiers"", King Vajiralongkorn normally spends only brief spells in the country he rules. But recently he has stayed put in Thailand. More striking still, for the first time since his accession (and indeed the first time in decades), he has mingled with his people. The stiff and aloof king has gone walkabout, descending from his vintage Rolls-Royce to allow adoring subjects dressed in yellow (which signifies devotion to the monarchy) to touch the royal feet. In his first comments as king to the foreign press, with Queen Suthida on his arm, he expressed ""love"" for all Thais, protesters included. Thailand, he added, is a ""land of compromise"".
The monarchy's critics are not swallowing it. The martinet king has taken personal command of important military units and direct control over the crown's immense property holdings and investment portfolio. He now has at his disposal over $6obn in assets-more than the sultan of Brunei and the British royal family combined. Even if he is paying more attention to appearances, the critics say, there is no sign that the king, an absolutist through and through, is thinking of giving up any of his authority.
Meanwhile, says Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Kyoto University, a ""push factor"" helps explain the king's absence from Germany-the growing risks of greater parliamentary scrutiny of his presence there and whether it contravenes a ban on foreign states operating on German soil. The European press gleefully reports not only on how he churns through wives and mistresses but also on his cavortings. Paparazzi keep snapping the 68-year-old in crop tops and stick-on tattoos. A spell out of the limelight could be helpful.
For the protesters, the king's conduct in Germany only reinforces their scorn for his attempts to burnish his image in Thailand. Not least, a mistress, Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, whom the king summarily dismissed last year for ""misbehaviour"" and ""disloyalty"", has been reinstated as the ""untainted"" royal consort. She accompanies the king and queen on their walkabouts. The king's polygyny, his humiliation of the women vying for his capricious affection; his habit of making even the prime minister prostrate himself before his majesty: instead of connecting with members of a new generation demanding gender equality, democracy and respect for individual rights, the king's comportment repulses them. As Netiwit ""Frank"" Chotiphatphaisal, a prominent activist, puts it, the walkabouts-the king in a white military uniform slathered with gold braid-are just cosplay in service of the king's ego.
Mr Pavin points out that, for all his talk of compromise, the king, although supposedly above the political fray, only meets and greets his supporters. Meanwhile, the prime minister, Prayuth Chanocha, who led the coup in 2014 in which the army (ostensibly in defence of the monarchy) seized power, grows less conciliatory by the day. In particular, a draconian law against ""insulting"" the monarchy has been dusted off and used against more than a score of activists. Mr Prayuth's star, admittedly, is waning with the king, not least for letting the protests wax so dramatically. But if Mr Prayuth is dismissed as a scapegoat, it will surely be because King Vajiralongkorn wants his successor to take a harder line. With the monarch digging in and young protesters convinced that change has arrived, the cosplay is becoming serious."

DELHI
The government is moving Rohingyas to a remote island
The flotilla that sailed from the port of Chattogram (formerly known as Chittagong) in southern Bangladesh on December 4th was carrying some 1,642 refugees to a new life across the water. But their destination was no far-off promised land. It took less than four hours' churning through the wide, muddy estuary of the Meghna River to reach Bhasan Char, an island no bigger than a large city park, and so freshly formed it barely peeps above surrounding tidal flats (see map).
It is here, improbably, that the government of Bangladesh has built a red-roofed, grid-patterned model town, intended to house Rohingyas, an ethnic minority from neighbouring Myanmar. Some 700,000 of them were chased into Bangladesh three years ago by the Burmese army and allied militias in a horrifying bout of ethnic cleansing. Bhasan Char can house about 100,000. The hosts present the new settlement, erected at a cost of $300m by the Bangladeshi navy, as a safe, sanitary and humane alternative to the teeming and squalid refugee camps that have mushroomed along the jungly border.
Yet while some of the island's new residents say they are happy to have pukka plumbing and cement floors, to many Rohingyas the permanence and isolation of the model town promise not relief but the institutionalisation of their misery. An island exile, they fear, would mean less hope of pricking the world's conscience, and so less hope of ever returning to their original homes in Myanmar. ""After this move to Bhasan Char, I see our people slowly dying,"" warns Ambia Perveen of the European Rohingya Council, an ngo. ""We are becoming the Palestinians of Asia.""
When Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the prime minister of Bangladesh, launched the relocation project in 2018, a chorus of similar objections erupted. Even as construction went ahead, diplomats and aid workers expressed doubt that large numbers of refugees would ever be settled on a remote island prone to cyclones and floods. Aside from the cost and negative publicity, they assumed, such a transfer would weaken the argument, strongly advanced by Bangladesh, that Myanmar itself must bear responsibility for the fate of the Rohingyas.
As time has passed, however, Sheikh Hasina's government has faced growing internal pressure. Although proud that their own crowded country of 165m has aided and sheltered so many desperate refugees, ordinary Bangladeshis have gradually grown less welcoming. Stories of violent crime and disease in the border camps have spread, exacerbated by fears of covid-19 and by the smuggling from Myanmar of arms and of drugs such as yaba, a cheap form of methamphetamine that is ubiquitous in Bangladesh.
The police, who in addition fear jihadist radicalisation among refugees, have adopted an increasingly harsh line in the camps. Odhikar, a Bangladeshi human-rights group, claims that since 2017 perhaps 100 Rohingya men have been killed during alleged ""gunfights"" with security forces, in incidents that look more like executions. It has also built barbed-wire fences around the sprawling camps, the biggest of which houses nearly 600,000 people.
Restrictions on the refugees are multiplying. Last year the government banned them from owning sim cards and ordered the telecom authority to block mobile-internet service in the camps. Though the networks were restored a few months ago, sim cards are still forbidden. Rohingyas are also barred from holding bank accounts and from paid work. Learning is almost as hard as earning. Having resisted pressure from ngos to grant Rohingyas access to education for nearly three years, the government had been on the verge of allowing some children to go school in April, when covid-19 intervened.
The move to Bhasan Char fits this pattern, and the growing authoritarianism of Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power without interruption since 2009. Troublemakers can be more easily controlled on the island, and it would be useful to reduce the density of mainland camps. It is perhaps no coincidence that cctv cameras monitor all the streets of Bhasan Char, or that the government has just created a new body to oversee refugee affairs. The 15-person committee includes at least ten senior security officials, and no representatives of the Rohingyas.
Despite deep misgivings among aid workers, there is some sympathy for Bangladesh's dilemma. If the relocation brings more attention to the Rohingyas' plight, that might be a silver lining, speculates John Quinley of Fortify Rights, an advocacy group. ""Bangladesh is right, calling out the international community for not pushing hard enough on Myanmar,"" he says. The un High Commissioner for Refugees, the main coordinator of international relief, tiptoes around criticism of Sheikh Hasina's government. What it and smaller charitable outfits would most like is access to Bhasan Char. So far, Bangladesh has not allowed any regular visits, or any independent assessment of the model town. Without this, the un cannot offer assistance.
Despite some individual reports of satisfaction with new homes on the island, which also boasts schools and medical facilities, the refugees on the mainland seem mostly sceptical. Many claim that the first to relocate to Bhasan Char were not volunteers, as claimed by the government, but were threatened by police, coerced or swayed by false promises of money. ""They should call it jail island,"" says Ro, a resident of a mainland camp, walking uphill for better telephone reception and a jumbled vista of plastic sheeting, tin roofs and bamboo walls. At least here the Rohingya are close to the border, and have some strength in numbers, he says. *"

China says it is not exporting a political model, but its officials like to give tips
In early december Xi Jinping, China's leader, declared that the Communist Party had met a self-imposed deadline. Extreme poverty (defined as earning a bit more than $1 a day) has been eradicated from China. Naturally, the party is keen to tell others about its success in fighting penury. In October it hosted a mostly-virtual two-day seminar on the subject for nearly 400 people from more than 100 countries. Participants quoted by official media gushed praise for China's progress. But the gathering was not just about uplifting the needy. It was also aimed at showing off China's political model.
In the West, recent coverage of China's diplomacy has been dominated by talk of how aggressive it has become. Some of its diplomats have been dubbed ""wolf warriors"" because of their habit of snarling at foreign critics (the label refers to the title of a jingoistic Chinese film). To non-Western audiences, by contrast, Chinese officials are speaking more softly. They preach the virtues of a form of governance that they believe is making China rich and can help other countries, too. Some welcome this message, even in multiparty democracies. At the poverty-alleviation forum, the secretary-general of Kenya's ruling Jubilee Party, Raphael Tuju, was quoted as saying that China's Communist Party should be an example for his own.
In 2017 Mr Xi caused a stir in the West by suggesting that China's development model offered ""a new option"" for other countries, and that a ""Chinese approach"" could help solve humanity's problems. Though he later insisted that his country did not plan to export a ""China model"", the country's officials have been, in effect, doing just that. Some of those engaged in this effort belong to the foreign ministry. But many, such as those who organised the recent seminar on poverty, work for a branch of the Communist Party called the International Department. Its job is to win support for China among foreign political parties.
The department is well suited to the task. Because it does not directly represent the Chinese state it has no role to play in verbal sparring. But as a party outfit it has considerable authority. It works closely with the foreign ministry and swaps personnel with it.
Late in 2017 it held a convention in Beijing joined by leaders and other members of political parties from 120 countries. Some delegates were from rich democracies such as Japan, New Zealand and America. (Both Republicans and Democrats attended.) Mr Xi gave the keynote address. Many participants signed a statement, the ""Beijing Initiative"", praising the Communist Party and Mr Xi. The department has few qualms about the kind of political parties with which it interacts. ""They'll deal with right-wing parties and they'll deal with left-wing parties and everybody in between,"" says David Shambaugh of George Washington University.
Under Mr Xi one of the department's main activities has been organising training sessions for foreign political parties, especially those from developing countries. It does not say outright that authori-1 tarianism is good. But its mission is clearly to promote the virtues of strong centralised leadership. In November Song Tao, the department's boss, claimed in an online briefing of party leaders from 36 sub-Saharan African countries that the party's achievements in development proved the wisdom of five-year plans. ""The Chinese system,"" he said, could ""serve as a reference"" for his audience. He said that ""only by upholding the leadership of the party"" could such plans ""stay on the right track"".
During the pandemic much of the department's instruction has been conducted online, often focusing on China's achievements in crushing covid-19 (one lesson: tough measures work). Expositions on Mr Xi's three-part tome, ""The Governance of China"" have also been a common feature. In recent months such classes have been attended by officials from ruling parties in Angola, Congo-Brazzaville, Ghana, Mozambique, Panama and Venezuela.
Official websites in China often advertise these efforts. One describes a groundbreaking ceremony in 2018 for a Chinafunded ideological school in Tanzania. It was attended by Mr Song, the department's boss, and by ruling-party officials from Tanzania, South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
In democracies such as Ghana, Kenya and South Africa the department sponsors trips to China by ruling-party members for the study of party-building and governance. In 2018 Ghana's ruling centre-right New Patriotic Party (npp) asked for such training in part to ""deepen its ideological skills"", found Joshua Eisenman of the University of Notre Dame, an expert on the department's activities in Africa. The former ruling party of Ghana, the National Democratic Congress (ndc), has sent dozens of its staff to China for such training. The ndc has also opened a leadership school in Ghana. It uses teaching materials devised by the Chinese Communist Party.
It is unclear what foreign party members gain from China's training sessions. They may be no more than a means of career advancement, or of paying ritual homage to Mr Xi's wisdom in order to curry favour-China being a valuable source of loans and investment in many developing countries. The seminars can be boozy junkets, dreary snoozefests, or both. An Egyptian veteran of them says they are hardly rigorous; she likened the experience to a ""paid vacation"".
The department says it has contact with more than 600 political organisations in over 160 countries. Under Mr Xi such engagements have grown. Christine Hackenesch and Julia Bader, writing for International Studies Quarterly, found that the number of high-level party-to-party meetings increased by more than 50% between 2012 and 2017, to more than 230 annually. Martin Hala of Sinopsis, which monitors China's activities in Central Europe, has called this akin to forming a ""new Comintern""-a reference to the old Soviet-led international communist movement.
There is a critical difference, however. China is not preaching communism. Its aim, rather, is to show that a country can become richer without being democratic. That message finds attentive ears among politicians who find the checks and balances of democracy irksome. In June Kenya's Mr Tuju (the cheerleader for China at the anti-poverty seminar in October) was challenged about his party's affection for the Chinese Communist Party by a reader of a Nairobi newspaper. He replied that he did not see what was wrong with ""learning from the most successful and the best run"" party in the world."

BEIJING
The pandemic gives China's disc jockeys a chance to shine
Getting into Zhao Dai, an underground nightclub in a fashionable part of Beijing, involves a little more faff than it once did. Party animals must prove that they have not travelled anywhere they might have picked up covid-19, by showing doormen a code generated by a government mobile app. Once inside, however, the smoke-filled basement is just as sweaty as usual. On a recent Saturday a hundred unmasked revellers bopped to techno tunes. No one bothered to maintain social distancing while dancing.
The pandemic posed an enormous threat to China's fragile club scene. Nightspots in Beijing were forced to shut in January. They did not reopen properly until August. Yet many electronic-music clubs have weathered the disruption, in part because punters freed from lockdown have flocked back to them. A bouncer eyeing the crowd at Zhao Dai says it is as busy as it was before the closures. Michael Ohlsson, the American owner of Dada, another Beijing club, says his business will probably break even this year, despite being closed for much of its first half.
The pandemic has wrought changes, nonetheless. Nightspots have long felt it necessary to fly in fashionable foreign djs to help them draw crowds. As a result Chinese performers have always had to make do with supporting slots, says Huang Hongli, a dj who uses the stage name of Hotwill. Now they have no choice but to give locals a chance to shine. This summer Zhao Dai held an outdoor festival, attended by 3,000 people. The 40 djs who performed there were all Chinese.
A second effect of the pandemic has been to help speed up the spread of China's club culture beyond its traditional bases in Beijing, Shanghai and the southwestern city of Chengdu. When nightclubs closed at the start of the year Mr Huang chose to leave the capital and return to Xiamen, his hometown south of Shanghai, in part because of its lower cost of living. There he helped to launch the city's first underground nightspot, which opened in April. This year's closures gave Mr Ohlsson more time to plan the opening of a new club in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province.
Not everyone is happy. Ezzz, a Chinese dj and music producer, grumbles that many of the djs who have gained new followings during the pandemic are proficient performers but do not ""understand electronic music culture"". Mr Huang looks forward to a time when a few more foreigners can enter the country; he thinks some exposure to trends from abroad is good for the local scene. As for the audience, few seem to care much who is performing, so long as they have somewhere to dance. Lea Liao, a Beijinger who attended Zhao Dai's summer festival, says she struggled to see the stage because of all the gyrating bodies. ""But I could hear the music, and that is all that matters."""

Avast expanse of sand dunes, studded with the wind-eroded ruins of lost Silk Road cities, the Taklamakan Desert is a fine place to hide a guilty secret. At first glance, shame is a plausible explanation for a mini construction-boom under way in this remote corner of Xinjiang. For outsiders are increasingly shocked by China's rule over this north-western region, where millions of Uyghurs, an ethnic minority, endure oppressive, high-tech surveillance and the constant fear of detention for alleged Islamic extremism.
For the past few years overseas human-rights groups and scholars have used satellite images and Chinese government documents to track dozens of factories rising on the Taklamakan's southern edge in Lop County, a poor and almost entirely Uyghur area. The factories line the newly laid streets of an industrial park sponsored by the city of Beijing, 4,000km to the east. More alarmingly, satellite images and the Xinjiang government's own propaganda suggest that as the park rose from the desert sands, at least one political re-education camp lurked amid the factories.
Across Xinjiang over a million Uyghurs have passed through such camps in recent years. Officials eventually admitted to the camps' existence in 2018. Pointing to terrorist attacks by Muslims from Xinjiang, they said China had set up vocational training centres to cure minds infected with religious extremism. In October 2018 China Central Television toured a camp in Hotan, an ancient oasis city. Detainees were shown in Mandarin-language classes, studying Chinese laws and learning such skills as sewing, before thanking authorities for saving them. In contrast, critics call the campaign both brutal in its methods and horrifyingly arbitrary in its application. Leaked government files record Uyghurs interned for such ""suspicious"" acts as growing long beards, applying for a passport or using foreign messaging services like Skype. Ex-detainees have accused camp staff of beatings and rapes.
Now this giant social-engineering project is evolving. In late 2019 officials said that all detainees have graduated from compulsory studies. On a recent weekend Chaguan visited the Hotan city camp toured by state television and found it apparently abandoned, observed only by a clutch of camels and locals digging for white jade in a dried-up riverbed. Closing highly visible sites signals shifting tactics, not a change of heart. China is merging counter-terrorism work in Xinjiang with nationwide campaigns to assimilate ethnic minorities and push the rural poor into formal employment, in the name of development and social stability. A State Council white paper from September, detailing training and job placement campaigns in Xinjiang, found 2.6m ""rural surplus workers"" in the region, notably Uyghurs with ""outdated ideas"".
Hints of trouble abound. The white paper blames ""terrorists, separatists and religious extremists"" for inciting locals to ""refuse to improve their vocational skills"". Global firms that audit multinational supply chains for labour abuses increasingly decline to operate in Xinjiang, blaming authorities for obstructing their work. Earlier this year the American government said that it suspects several businesses in Lop County of using forced labour, specifically firms trading in human hair. American customs officers seized tonnes of wigs and hairpieces in June, then afterwards banned all hair imports from the Lop County Hair Products Industrial Park, a zone within the Beijing Industrial Park. Chinese government spokesmen and state media dismiss talk of forced labour as a smear by Westerners bent on keeping China down.
To an optimist, such shrill denials might suggest that sanctions are biting. Xinjiang has a lot to lose: it supplies almost a fifth of the world's cotton, among other commodities. Your columnist, who is not generally an optimist, headed to Lop County to take a look in person. Chaguan travelled with a reporter from another Western newspaper. As happens in Xinjiang, police were already waiting for the foreign journalists at Hotan, the nearest airport to Lop County. An hour later, goons blocked an access road to the industrial park, turning Chaguan's taxi away. He and his colleague finally arrived on foot after a long desert walk around the park boundary, a metal fence topped with four strands of electrified wire.
Defiance in the desert
American sanctions have yet to paralyse Lop County's factories, it can be reported. On a freezing but sunny weekend morning, the entrance to the hair-products park was busy with traffic. Nearby, construction workers toiled on new buildings. The arrival of foreign reporters triggered bouts of pushing and arm-grabbing by unidentified men bent on stopping the Westerners from proceeding further, one of whom called himself ""the person responsible for the park"". Trying to grab reporters' smartphones, they demanded the deletion of pictures of their industrial zone and of what appears to be a training facility at the park's southern end, resembling a secure boarding school, down to young adults lined up in rows on a playing field. Questions were greeted with evasions. ""We don't really have dealings with the outside world,"" replied one of the men when asked about American sanctions. Initially asserting that his company only sells to domestic markets, he then claimed that it makes nothing at all and ""is still being put together"".
The men staged one more physical confrontation when a hulking, prison-like complex with tall grey walls and guard towers came into view. Failing to stop the foreigners from seeing the prison, they focused on preventing photography.
Still, evidence-destruction is not a sign of a sore conscience. Bits of the park designed to be seen from the ground by locals are unapologetic. Giant rooftop characters in the training facility spell out such slogans as: ""Labour is glorious"" and ""Serve the economy"". A poster by the main gate shows President Xi Jinping surrounded by smiling Uyghur children. China's regime is secretive because it has no patience for debating its policies with foreigners. It is proud of its iron-fisted rule in Xinjiang, and is not about to change."

Worries grow about the treatment of children who say they are transgender
In 2018 andrea davidson's 12-year-old daughter, Meghan, announced she was ""definitely a boy"". Ms Davidson says her child was never a tomboy but the family doctor congratulated her and asked what pronouns she had chosen, before writing a referral to the British Columbia Children's Hospital (bcch). ""We thought we were going to see a psychologist, but it was a nurse and a social worker,"" says Ms Davidson (both her and her daughter's names have been changed). ""Within ten minutes they had offered our child Lupron""-a pubertyblocking drug. ""They brought up the drug directly with our child, in front of us, without discussing it with us privately first."" There was no mention of other mentalhealth issues, which are known to increase the likelihood of gender dysphoria, the feeling that you are in the wrong body. ""There was no therapy on offer and we were just brushed aside when we raised it.""
Meghan belongs to a wave of children across the Western world who have identified as transgender in recent years. America had one gender clinic in 2007; now it has more than 50. Piecemeal evidence around the world suggests that three-quarters of children expressing gender dysphoria at such clinics are adolescent girls, whereas until recently it was roughly evenly split. An increasing number are also de-transitioning, choosing to revert to their previous gender. Unfortunately, if children have already begun a medical transition, including hormone treatment, it can leave them infertile and unable to have a full sex life.
Earlier this month the High Court in London looked at the case of one detransitioner, Keira Bell, who had brought a judicial review against the Tavistock clinic, England's only specialist youth genderidentity centre. She claimed that the clinic should not have allowed her to take puberty blockers and later undergo testosterone treatment and a double mastectomy. The court ruled that it was ""highly unlikely"" that a 13-year-old and ""doubtful"" that 14and 15-year-olds are mature enough to consent to such a procedure, and that doctors treating 16- and 17-year-olds may also need to consult a judge before starting.
Trans activists argue that a long-marginalised group is now finding its voice in popular culture. Their critics retort that vulnerable teenagers are losing themselves in an online world which adulates anyone who comes out as trans. Both could be right. ""Being straight is boring,"" says Meghan's younger sibling.
Society is struggling to strike a balance. Some children who feel they are in the wrong body will always feel that way and might benefit from altering their bodies. Others will change their minds-many of these will simply turn out to be gay. No medical test can tell these two groups apart. Children with mental-health problems or conditions such as autism are more likely to experience gender dysphoria. Untangling all this is extremely hard.
However, there are worries that rich countries have the balance wrong. One of the Dutch scholars on whose work the prescribing of hormones and surgery is based has said that her research is being applied to young people for whom it was not designed. And a growing number of people are dissenting. The Economist spoke to more than four dozen people in rich English-speaking countries, including trans people, parents, doctors, social workers, teachers and people who had identified as trans when they were children. Most of those who were critical wanted to be anon- ymous for fear of losing their jobs or being branded bigots on Twitter.
""The first duty of medicine is 'Do no harm',"" says a Canadian paediatrician. ""In any other branch of medicine, if you were causing permanent sterility with body-altering surgery and cross-sex hormones, you had better have some pretty strong data...But we're already going down that road with no strong data at all.""
To find the best approach will require debate. Some activists do not welcome debate, however. ""We are liberal people,"" says Ms Davidson. ""But we are always made to feel like we are right-wing crackpots for raising questions.""
Crossing a Rubicon
Nobody has global statistics for the rate of trans cases among children. Referrals to the Tavistock in London have surged 30fold in a decade, with 2,700 children referred there last year. Nearly half those referred will start on puberty blockers. In 2019-20, the bcch treated 382 patients in its gender clinic, up from 123 in 2016-17. America does not publish statistics. However, in a survey of American high-school students in 2017 by the Centres for Disease Control 1.8% said they were transgender and a further 1.6% said they were unsure.
The case for puberty blockers is that they can help children with severe gender dysphoria, who feel desperate about developing the ""wrong"" sex characteristics. That is because the drugs could spare them distress and, potentially, traumatic interventions later: a double mastectomy; a hysterectomy or the shaving of the Adam's apple.
Many who go through full medical transition say they are happy with the result. Tru Wilson, who lives in Vancouver, is one. Tru was a gentle boy, and Tru's parents thought their child might be gay. They then watched a programme together on trans kids and Tru said, ""That's me!"" Tru, now 17, began on blockers at 12, on oestrogen at 14, and is expecting to go through surgery within the next year. ""I have zero regrets on how my journey went,"" she says. Her father, Garfield, has been impressed by physicians at the bcch. ""There was no pressure pushing us to do anything that we didn't feel was right for our daughter."" Many other parents also report positive experiences. bcch says that they take the use of puberty blockers seriously and all their patients ""go through rigorous assessments including confirmation that they are capable of considering the benefits and risks"".
But other transitioners come to see such procedures as a mistake. Claire (not her real name), now a 19-year-old student in Florida, started on testosterone aged 14 because of a loathing for her body. (She was also deeply depressed.) ""I felt it was the only option, especially with the insistence that having dysphoria meant you are irrevocably trans and thus you will probably kill yourself if you don't transition."" Obtaining hormones was easy, she says. ""They pretty much gold-stamped me through."" Then, aged 17, her dysphoria disappeared. ""I felt extremely lost. I had never heard of this happening."" She came off testosterone, embraced her identity as a lesbian, and is furious. ""It is the medical industry and the general social attitude towards dysphoric people that failed me.""
Such ""desistance"" appears to be common. At least half a dozen medical studies show that between 61% and 98% of children presenting with gender-related distress were reconciled to their natal sex before adulthood. However, all these studies looked at children with early-onset dysphoria. One recent study on adolescent dysphoria among girls suggested that in many cases it is brought on by the influence of the internet, by female friends who have transitioned and by the miseries of puberty. ""What is needed is quality research into adolescent-onset dysphoria among girls, and the overlap with autism and mental-health diagnoses,"" says Will Malone, an endocrinologist and director at the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, an international group of doctors and researchers.
The decision to desist is hardest for those who have received medical treatment. Lisa Marchiano, a Jungian therapist in Philadelphia, counsels several such people. They all believe they were given access to medical interventions too soon. ""It takes enormous strength to admit you have invested so much in a strategy that is a mistake,"" she says.
The evidence in favour of medical treatment is being challenged, too. Arguments for providing hormones and surgery to dysphoric teenagers lean heavily on an intervention approach pioneered in the Netherlands, which has come to be known as ""the Dutch protocol"". This was tested on 55 young people with early-onset dysphoria. The teenagers were treated with puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and, after they turned 18, surgery. There was no control group. Instead the results of a study of the approach, published in 2014, concluded that these medical interventions were successful on the basis of psychological functioning at least one year after surgery.
The authors warn that their paper contains a small sample, measures only shortterm psychological outcomes and has no evaluation of the implications for physical health. One of its researchers, Annelou de Vries, this year published a commentary in Pediatrics, a medical journal, saying that the approach is being wrongly applied to children (mostly girls) with adolescent-onset dysphoria. She emphasised the need to identify those who need enhanced mentalhealth support, rather than gender reassignment. Carl Heneghan, a professor at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, wrote last year that use of the Dutch protocol amounts to an ""unregulated live experiment on children"". The High Court in England also called such interventions ""experimental"". The flood of hormones in puberty help reconcile a child to their sex in a way that doctors do not fully understand. Blockers stop that.
No turning back
The Tavistock clinic argued that puberty blockers are reversible. That is true up to a point. However, they can affect bone density and so doctors often want to move patients on to cross-sex hormones, which have more permanent effects. The court concluded that blockers almost always lead on to hormones, which carry health risks. Testosterone heightens the chance of heart problems. It leads to vaginal and uterine atrophy which can make a hysterectomy necessary in later life.
Despite the uncertainties, many doctors have embraced medical intervention. The standard approach used to be ""watchful waiting"", which advocates counselling before moving on to hormones and surgery. However, Joshua Safer of the Mount Sinai Centre for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York says puberty blockers are now ""the conservative option"" because they allow children time to decide what they want to do. Medical bodies including the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (wpath) now say that affirming a person's transgender identity is ""international best practice"".
In America intervention was boosted by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which banned health insurers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In effect, they were thus obliged to cover hormones for people who say they are trans just as they provide contraceptive hormones for women.
In 2018 the American Association of Pediatrics (aap) said that all medical evidence supports the ""affirmative"" approach. But according to a detailed rebuttal by James Cantor, a Canadian sexual-behaviour scientist, none of the 11 academic studies of the subject reaches that conclusion.
Plenty of doctors fail to observe even wpath's guidelines. Laura EdwardsLeeper, a professor of psychology at Pacific University in Oregon who helped found America's first transgender clinic for children and teens in Boston, says she gets many emails from parents ""desperate to find a therapist who will not just blindly affirm that their child is trans"". Ideally, she said, an adolescent with gender dysphoria would have been regularly seeing a therapist, who encouraged them to explore other possible causes for their feelings and had a comprehensive psychological assessment before being put on blockers or hormones. ""It is very rare that even one of these things happens,"" she says.
Schools, the new front line
Affirmation in the clinic often echoes affirmation at school. Canada and some Australian states forbid discrimination against anyone on the basis of their self-declared gender identity. The main school programme, taught in British Columbia and Alberta and due to be rolled out across Canada, is called soGi-123. Much of the sogi programme is uncontroversial, about being kind and opposing bullying. But critics worry it makes questioning a child's decisions difficult.
Pamela Buffone, who runs a website called Canadian Gender Report, says that such programmes attach the concept of ""gender identity"" (the idea that a biological male can identify as a woman, or a female as a man) to the more familiar concept of ""sexual orientation"" (being gay or straight). In March last year Ms Buffone launched a legal complaint against a school board in Ottawa over a lesson, under a different programme, in which she says her six-year-old daughter was taught that there is no such thing as boys and girls.
People who support the new curriculum say that it is important to teach trans issues in school just as it is important to teach about race or religion. Glen Hansman, a Canadian teacher who was instrumental in the implementation of sogi, says that affirming pronouns and names in schools is ""not a gateway drug to other things"". Vince, an 18-year-old trans boy in rural Canada, (also not his real name) says that sogi is a lifeline for many young trans people. He wishes the programme had existed in his school, where he says he was assaulted for being gender non-conforming.
Many legislators, not wanting to look bigoted, are supportive, too. Having seen how the state failed gay people, they are determined that it should not repeat the mistake with trans people. In America Joe Biden has promised to sign the Equality Act into law. That will do a lot to combat widespread discrimination against trans people, such as in housing and the workplace. But it also redefines sex to include gender identity. That could be read to endorse the idea that children should be affirmed in the identity they choose and receive treatment for it-even if that identity may turn out to be temporary.
In Australia the capital, Canberra, and the state of Queensland have outlawed ""conversion therapy"" in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity. So too have some American states. Canada is considering a similar law. This conflates two separate issues. Many people would say it is wrong to try to convert gay people into being straight. But the implicit definition of trans conversion therapy risks outlawing any counselling that helps children decide whether their dysphoria is permanent or a phase, and what to do about it.
A backlash is beginning. In Sweden, after a 1,500% rise in gender dysphoria diagnoses among 13- to 17-year-old girls in 2008-18, more media coverage has focused on the problems of children transitioning. Aleksa Lundberg, an activist, said that she would probably not undergo surgery if she had the same choice today. Referrals of children to gender clinics have fallen by 65% in a year. Finland recently released stricter guidelines, recommending different treatment for early-onset and adolescent-onset dysphoria, and encouraging patients to seek counselling.
In America trans activists see questions about treatment as political. Chase Strangio, a trans lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, tweeted of the English court's decision: ""Please see this for what it is-an attempt to weaponise our happiness, our hopefulness, and our love of our bodies. This is a dangerous attack on trans survival and it is spreading.""
Some politicians in conservative American states have drawn up bills that would make it illegal for doctors to prescribe puberty blockers or hormones to children. This is largely an attempt to inflame the culture wars, but it also reflects the worries of some parents.
Ms Buffone says she raised concerns with her daughter's school and the local authority. ""It was as though I had left Canada and arrived in some kind of authoritarian state. They said this is what we are doing and it was clear I had no recourse."" Some parents in Quebec, which has its own curriculum, are also objecting. When Catherine, a consultant, asked to see the content of her six-year-old's sex-education class, the school refused, so she made a freedom-ofinformation request. It turned out teachers are told that ""Children can begin to explore their gender identity between the ages of 3 and 7"" and that sex is ""assigned"" at birth rather than observed.
A legal minefield
The Australian Family Court has in recent years removed itself from decisions about giving blockers and hormones and even surgery for teenagers, unless parents disagree. Instead, it has recently seen the first case of a child being removed from parents who did not support transition. The ruling was hardly reported in the press.
Patrick Parkinson, dean of law at the University of Queensland, says Ms Bell's judgment in England means that such parents will have a basis to oppose their daughter's removal. He thinks doctors' claims that puberty blockers are reversible and do no harm have been debunked. ""This is a massive wake-up call for the medical profession in Australia,"" he says.
However for many doctors in transgender clinics in America, the idea of restricting the use of puberty blockers in children is anathema. Johanna Olson-Kennedy of the Centre for Transyouth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles says she mourns the loss of ""this incredible tool"" for English children. ""I think there is going to be an avalanche of lawsuits,"" says Dianna Kenny, recently retired professor of psychology at the University of Sydney. ""But they won't be in time to save a generation of adolescents who have been wrongly diagnosed as being trans.""
As for Ms Davidson, daughter Meghan still struggles with depression. However she decided, with her parents, not to take the Lupron. In May, by then 14, she announced: ""Mum, I've decided I'm a girl."" She put on lots of make-up and went to the shopping mall to get her nails painted. But the experience has turned her mother into an activist. She has signed up with cawsbar, a women's group that advocates for rights to be based on biological sex. ""I'm mad as hell,"" she says."

Companies have issued more debt and equity in 2020 than ever before. What now?
In march the corporate world found itself staring into the abyss, recalls Susie Scher. From her perch overseeing global capital markets at Goldman Sachs, a bank, she witnessed firms scrambling for money to keep going as the wheels of commerce ground to a halt amid the pandemic. Many investors panicked. Surely, the thinking went, public markets would freeze in the frigid fog of covid-19 uncertainty-and then stay frozen.
Instead, within weeks they began to thaw, then simmer, kindled by trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus from governments desperate to avert an economic nuclear winter. In the past few months they have turned boiling hot.
According to Refinitiv, a data provider, this year the world's non-financial firms have raised an eye-popping $3.6trn in capital from public investors (see chart 1). Issuance of both investment-grade and riskier junk bonds set records, of $2.4trn and $426bn, respectively. So did the $538bn in secondary stock sales by listed stalwarts, which leapt by 70% from last year, reversing a recent trend to buy back shares rather than issue new ones.
Initial public offerings (ipos), too, are flirting with all-time highs, as startups hope to cash in on rich valuations lest stockmarkets lose their frothiness, and venture capitalists (vcs) patience with loss-making business models. vcs still plough three times as much into American startup stars as public investors do. But proceeds from listings are now growing faster than private funding rounds (see chart 2 on next page). And the boom is global in nature (see chart 3). On December 2nd JD Health, a Chinese online pharmacy, raked in $3.5bn in Hong Kong. A week later DoorDash, an American food-delivery darling, and Airbnb, a home-rental platform, both more or less matched it in New York.
In a world of near-zero interest rates, it appears, investors will bankroll just about anyone with a shot at outliving covid-19. Some of that money will go up in smoke, with or without the corona-crisis. What does not get torched will bolster corporate haves, sharpening the contrast between them and the have-nots.
The original spark that lit capital markets on fire was the $6.25bn in debt and equity that Carnival Cruise Lines secured in April, remembers Carlos Hernandez of JPMorgan Chase, a bank. Investors reasoned that cruises will one day set sail again-by which time some of Carnival's flimsier rivals will have sunk. Other dominant firms have benefited from this logic. Boeing, part of a planemaking duopoly, sold $25bn in bonds this spring, even as its bestselling 737 max jetliner remained on the ground and the near-term future of travel up in the air. Many Chinese companies have taken to issuing perpetual bonds, which are never redeemed but pay interest for ever, to repair their balance-sheets.
By the summer, notes Ms Scher, ""rescue capital-raising"" had given way to something less defensive. Investors' ultraloose purse-strings allowed opportunistic firms to lock in historically low coupons. s&p Global, a rating agency, calculates that the average investment-grade bond issued this year paid interest of 2.6% amid the covid recession, down from 2.8% in 2019. Thanks to a boom in online shopping and cloud computing, Amazon, which is a leader in both areas, can now borrow at 1.5% for ten years, more cheaply than any American firm since at least 1980-and than some governments. Indebted giants like at&t, a telecoms-and-entertainment group, are lengthening debt maturities. In November Saudi Aramco, an oil colossus, sold $2.3bnworth of 50-year bonds, in spite of looming climate policies that may cripple its business of selling crude long before 2070.
Even cheap debt, of course, must be rolled over and, perpetuities aside, eventually paid back. With stockmarket valuations propped up by loose monetary policy, and only a slim prospect of tightening, many firms opted to shore up their balance-sheets with new share issues. Danaher, a high-rolling industrial conglomerate, raised over $1.5bn by selling new stock just after its share price returned to its pre-pandemic highs in May; it has risen by 39% since. On December 8th Tesla, an electric-car maker whose market value has grown seven-fold this year, to $573bn, said it plans to issue $5bn-worth of shares.
With shareholder payouts trimmed or suspended until the covid fog lifts, the cash held by the world's 3,000 most valuable listed non-financial firms has exploded to $7.6trn, from $5.7trn last year (see chart 4). Even if you exclude America's abnormally cash-rich technology giants-Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook- corporate balance-sheets are brimming with liquidity.
It is still too early to tell what firms will do with all that cash. The merger market is showing signs of life, though mostly as deals put on ice during the pandemic are being revived. Many companies will content themselves with maintaining liquidity, at least until a covid-19 vaccine becomes more widely available.
Startups, for their part, will use ipo proceeds to blitzscale their way to profitability. The pandemic has made business models that might not have matured for years, such as digital health, suddenly viable. Many will fail. But for now giddy investors are pouring money into any firm whose ipo prospectus features the words ""digital"", ""cloud"" or ""health"". Headier still, ""special purpose acquisition companies"", which go public with nothing but a promise to merge with a sexy startup later on, and which have raised $70bn in 2020, mostly on Wall Street, are shattering previous records.
Markets seem no more discerning in mainland China, where proceeds from listings hit $63bn, the most since 2010. Hong Kong added another $46bn. Shanghai's star Market, a year-old technology board, this week welcomed its 200th member, bringing its ipo haul to $44bn. In September demand for shares to be traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by Nongfu Spring, a water-bottler, outstripped supply by 1,148 times. Even the authorities' lastminute suspension of Ant Group's recordbreaking $40bn ipo in Hong Kong and Shanghai, after the fintech titan's co-founder annoyed regulators, may not frighten other listers. And so long as geopolitical tensions between America and China persist, more Chinese firms with an American stock ticker may avail themselves of a Hong Kong one, observes Julien Begasse de Dhaem of Morgan Stanley, a bank.
For now, capital is likely to keep flowing. Mr Hernandez says his bank's pipeline of ipos looks ""the most robust in years"". The ten-year Treasury yield is below 1% and the spreads between American government and corporate bonds have narrowed to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, even riskier firms' paper yields less than 5%, according to JPMorgan Chase. Investors expecting meaningful returns are therefore eyeing stocks. For the pandemic's corporate winners, the choice between cheap debt and cheap equity is a win-win. *"

A formidable alliance takes on Facebook. Investors don't seem to care
Letitia james, New York's attorney-general, couldn't be blunter in describing the antitrust case lodged on December 9th against the world's biggest social network. ""By using its vast troves of data and money Facebook has squashed or hindered what the company perceived as potential threats. They've reduced choices for consumers, they stifled innovation and they degraded privacy protections for millions of Americans,"" she declared, summarising the accusations. Forty-five states joined her bipartisan coalition against the giant. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission (ftc) sued Facebook for monopolistic practices in social-networking and demanded remedies including the firm's break-up.
A few years ago co-ordinated action by 46 states and the ftc that could split Facebook apart was unthinkable, says Lina Khan, an antitrust scholar at Columbia Law School. But the case is about more than narrow competition law. The controversies around Facebook's privacy practices, the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories on the platform, and its exploitation by authoritarian regimes mean regulators and politicians are set on forcing change.
Will they succeed? The cases look strong. Experts judge Facebook to be the lowest-hanging antitrust fruit, alongside Google (which America's Justice Department sued over alleged monopoly abuses in October). Amazon and Apple are in the crosshairs, but those cases will take longer, if they come at all, says an antitrust expert.
The Facebook lawsuits centre on its acquisitions. The firm maintained its monopoly in personal social-networking by systematically buying up potential competitors, both contend-notably Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. A smoking gun could be Onavo, an Israeli firm Facebook bought in 2013-to protect user data, the firm said. The suits claim it in fact used Onavo to track rival apps' popularity and select acquisition targets. Another alleged anti-competitive practice was blocking rival app developers from its platform. As consumer harm is hard to prove against big tech's mostly free products, the suits try a novel argument: that damage is done to users' privacy and advertisers' choice.
Facebook will argue that its market is social media, which is broader and more competitive than social-networking. TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app, is now more popular than Instagram among American teenagers. The internal Facebook emails on which the lawsuits hinge hardly paint a picture of a lazy monopolist; Mr Zuckerberg and his lieutenants see competitive threats everywhere. Facebook can also argue that breaking it up is wellnigh impossible. Last year it started integrating Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger more deeply. And the ftc's complaint fails to mention it cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp deals. The government ""now wants a do-over"", sending a chilling warning to American business that ""no sale will ever be final"", Facebook said.
Markets shrugged off the news. Facebook's shares dipped by 2%, in line with the rest of big tech. Investors either see forced divestitures as unlikely, says Brent Thill of Jefferies, an investment bank-or spy even more money to be made from spin-offs. *"
12-Dec-20,https://www-proquest-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/abicomplete/docview/2469462502/fulltext/7DBC0D1F86B642C6PQ/53?accountid=14657,"A new book argues that decency pays off in business as well as in life
Nice guys finish last. That pithy motto was coined by Leo Durocher, a baseball manager noted for exulting at injuring his opponents and for cheating his players at cards. In 1969 his Chicago Cubs had a big lead in the closing weeks of the season, but he so alienated his squad (and the umpires) that the team failed to make it to the World Series. In his case, nasty guys finished behind.
This is one of the tales told by David Bodanis, a writer best known for his science books, who has turned his attention to the issue of how leaders should exercise their authority. The core message in his book, ""The Art of Fairness"", can be found in the subtitle: ""The power of decency in a world turned mean"".
The Empire State Building was constructed in just 13 months, and that included the dismantling of the WaldorfAstoria hotel that sat on the site. Paul Starrett, the builder, treated his workers rather well by the standards of the time, paying much attention to safety and paying employees on days when it was too windy to work. Daily wages were more than double the usual rate and hot meals were provided on site.
The concept is known as ""efficiency wages"". Companies that compensate workers well and treat them fairly can attract better, more motivated staff. Unlike most construction projects, the Empire State Building had low staff turnover, and workers suggested productivity improvements such as building a miniature railway line to bring bricks to the site. But Starrett was not naively generous; he hired accountants to patrol the works, checking that all materials were accounted for, and staff attendance was recorded four times a day.
The author contrasts Starrett's story with the tale of Eastern Air Travel, an airline built by Eddie Rickenbacker, a pioneer aviator who had granted mechanics a 40-hour week, profit-related pay and a pension. But when Frank Lorenzo took over the company in the 1980s, he cut wages, alienated the staff and pursued a policy of asset-stripping the company. The workers went on strike in protest and Eastern went bankrupt.
Another contrast cited by the author is that between Steve Ballmer, the hardcharging chief executive of Microsoft notorious for his towering rages, and his more emollient successor, Satya Nadella. Mr Ballmer so disliked Apple that he seized an iPhone from a subordinate in full view of the humiliated employee and pretended to stomp on it. On his watch Microsoft missed out on several promising business opportunities. On the day Mr Ballmer announced his departure the share price jumped by 7.5%. Under Mr Nadella, Microsoft has successfully shifted its attention to cloud-based services and even briefly regained the title of the world's most valuable listed company.
Public projects also require management skills. When Danny Boyle, a film director, was asked to organise the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, he faced the tough task of keeping the details secret when the project required thousands of volunteers. The conventional approach would have been to make the volunteers sign a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he asked them to keep the surprise-and trusted them to do so. They did, thanks to the grown-up way he treated them. He listened to their ideas for improving parts of the ceremony and ensured (by threatening to resign) that the volunteers did not have to pay for their costumes.
Mr Boyle demonstrated one of the most important traits of good leadership, the author argues, which is a willingness to listen. This relates to a concept known as the ""power distance"". If a relationship has a high power-distance score, it is assumed that junior staff should not question their superiors' decisions; a lower score means that senior staff are willing to listen.
Perceptions may differ sharply over whether listening takes place. A study by Johns Hopkins University found that 64% of the medical specialists interviewed felt that their operations had high levels of teamwork, whereas only 28% of their nurses agreed.
Individuals can become fixated on a particular approach to resolving a problem and ignore any advice that suggests a different tack, especially if it comes from a junior colleague. ""When your underlings aren't terrified of you, and you're modest enough to know you're fallible, you can set up the channels that will help you avoid fixation,"" Mr Bodanis writes. It is a wise lesson. Ruling by fear may work for a while, but it is doomed to fail in the long run. Remember Durocher."

More legal disputes over business in India are settled elsewhere
Amazon, vodafone and Cairn Energy operate in different industries: e-commerce, telecoms and oil-and-gas exploration, respectively. But they share a common predicament. All are waging legal battles over their Indian operations-and doing so outside India.
The trio are part of a larger wave. Last year nearly 500 cases filed in the Singapore International Arbitration Centre came from India. No other country came close (see chart on next page). The number of Indian parties involved in arbitration through the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce tripled last year, to 147. More quietly, London remains a crucial centre for India-related commercial spats, as to a lesser extent does The Hague. Two newish arbitration centres in the United Arab Emirates, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, want in on the game.
Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is believed to dislike this trend. His administration sees it, with reason, as an infringement of India's sovereignty-but also as impugning its laws and judicial process. The resistance to outside meddling in the country's legal affairs is echoed by its bar association, which blocks foreign lawyers and law firms from practising locally.
Crucial components of the legal system are nevertheless being outsourced. Companies feel that it is the best way to get a fair shot in India. And for all its grumbling, India's government understands that attracting investment requires the availability of a judicial recourse that is considered efficient and fair-which Indian courts can at times seem not to be.
The emigrant cases can be divided into two categories. The first kind involve the Indian government. Vyapak Desai of Nishith Desai Associates, an Indian law firm with expertise in the area, has compiled a list of more than a dozen big cases pending. Some were brought by Indian firms. In 2017 Reliance Industries, a conglomerate famous for ably navigating India's courts and bureaucracy, chose Singapore as the venue to fight a $1.6bn claim by the Indian government, which accused it of improperly extracting gas from fields owned by statecontrolled firms. Reliance won and was awarded $8m in compensation.
Foreign arbitration is all the more attractive for firms lacking Reliance's local nous. Cairn, which is British, filed its case in The Hague, arguing that it should be paid back $1.4bn in taxes involuntarily extracted on the basis of a retroactive law passed in 2012, which was applied to an asset sale six years earlier. Cairn says this violated a bilateral investment treaty between Britain and India; a decision is expected any day now. Vodafone's case stems from the same law and relies on a similar treaty which India signed with the Netherlands. The firm, which had purchased mobile-telephony assets in 2007, won a bitterly fought case before India's Supreme Court in 2012 exempting it from a capital-gains tax on the transaction, only to have the levy reimposed by India's parliament. In September it won a unanimous decision from a threeperson arbitration panel in The Hague.
The prime minister's office is said to be torn over offshore arbitration. On the one hand, it believes that foreigners have no right to contest Indian taxes; partly in response to such cases it has withdrawn from 73 bilateral investment treaties, including the British and Dutch ones, and imposed more onerous terms for challenging tax assessments in new ones it has signed.
On the other hand, it fears that rejecting arbitration would reinforce the sense that India is a toxic place for foreign firms to invest. Appealing against a decision-let alone ignoring it-brings costs, not least by putting off investors at a time when Mr Modi is keen to lure them away from China.
The second category of disputes settled abroad involves only private parties. These often move offshore simply because business moves fast whereas Indian courts do not. It takes more than three years on average to resolve a case before the High Court in Mumbai and nearly three years in Delhi, according to a study by Daksh, a research group. Seven years is not uncommon, Daksh says. Lawyers in Mumbai's High Court report that is not hard to find cases still pending from the 1960s.
Most of the offshore private cases are resolved quickly and quietly. Some, though, make headlines. The one involving Amazon is an example. In October the e-commerce giant won a favourable decision in Singapore to suspend the acquisition of a tottering retailer, Future Group, by Reliance. Amazon had earlier negotiated with Future a right of first refusal on any sale. Given Future's troubles, Amazon might reasonably have felt it had no time to wait for a sluggish Indian court to intervene. In appealing against the Singaporean arbitrator's decision to the Delhi High Court, Future accused Amazon of acting ""like the East India Company of the 21st century"". The comments chimed with Mr Modi's instructions to all Indians to ""be vocal for local"". They rhyme less well with his appeals to foreign investors. *"

BERLIN
Can Christian Klein overhaul sap's ageing business model?
ount on us, hold us accountable and Ctogether we will reinvent the way businesses run."" Thus ends a recent letter of support from 337 senior managers at sap, a maker of business software, to Christian Klein, their chief executive. In April Mr Klein, then a stripling 39 years old, took over as sole boss of Europe's biggest technology firm, after running it for a few months in tandem with Jennifer Morgan, an American who used to helm sap's business across the Atlantic. He needs all the love he can get, for sap faces a challenge.
Mr Klein became ceo at the peak of covid-19's first wave. It had hurt sap more than other tech firms: many of its biggest clients, such as carmakers and energy companies, were temporarily hit by the pandemic. And it struck as more rivals were vying for swathes of the business-software market that the German giant used to rule.
Then, in October, Mr Klein was humbled when he presented changes to sap's business model that would depress margins in the short run and delay earlier revenue and profit targets by two years. Combined with lacklustre results for the third quarter, the news shaved 22% off the firm's share price, wiping out €35bn ($41bn) in market value, the sharpest drop in 21 years and almost unheard of for a firm of sap's size (see top chart). The purchase of almost €250m in sap shares the following day by Hasso Plattner, chairman of the supervisory board, who co-founded the company 48 years ago, did not reassure investors.
To regain their confidence Mr Klein must improve sap's offering in the cloud, and persuade more of its clients to move there. And he needs to do this while fending off competition from firms such as Oracle, Salesforce and Workday in America, sap's biggest market.
The pandemic has softened demand for ""enterprise resource planning"" (erp) software, which firms use to manage their everyday operations-and which has long been sap's forte. It has also prompted sap's existing clients, typically large or mediumsized manufacturers, to rethink their erp processes. ""I never had so many calls from ceos who wanted to talk about supply chains,"" says Mr Klein. Retailers and manufacturers asked sap for tools to get more visibility of their suppliers. Critically, many of them demanded that erp, which has traditionally resided on firms' own servers, be moved to the cloud instead.
sap is very late to the cloud, where companies have been progressively moving for the past 20 years, says Liz Herbert of Forrester Research, a consulting firm. Oracle, which also embarked on the transition belatedly, has done so swiftly. So has Microsoft, the world's biggest software-maker, with ambitions to expand its enterprise offerings. By contrast, sap remains more of a hybrid. It has moved a chunk of its business to the cloud but many big customers still use its software on their premises.
Why the dithering? Shifting complex, customised end-to-end erp processes to the cloud is much harder than uploading human resources, sales or customer-relationship management, Mr Klein explains. And erp remains sap's bread and butter: it controls 21% of the market, according to Gartner, a research firm, compared with 11% for Oracle, its closest competitor (see bottom chart). A whopping 92% of Fortune 500 companies-from carmakers, like bmw, to defence firms, such as Lockheed Martin-use sap software. It therefore cannot get the transition wrong. sap listened to its customers and took a methodical approach, says an executive at a rival software firm, whereas the market wants it to move fast and break things.
Even so, says Mr Klein, ""covid was clearly an inflection point."" Bosses of big firms who may have waited another five years before switching to the cloud now want to speed up. They are also demanding a closer integration of sap affiliates acquired by Mr Klein's predecessor, Bill McDermott. These include Concur, a travel-expenses firm; Ariba, a procurement platform; and SuccessFactors, which makes hr software. This will require additional investments by sap. So will Mr Klein's plan to increase spending on research and development.
sap must now persuade its 35,000-odd erp clients of the benefits of the cloud. It must convince investors of the same thing. Licences for on-site software bring a big chunk of revenue upfront, whereas customers initially pay much less for rolling cloud subscriptions. But recurring revenues are increasingly coveted by all manner of technology firms, from Amazon and Apple to Netflix, because they are more predictable and build a closer relationship with customers. The shift to the subscription model will eventually mean a big revenue lift for sap, predicts Mark Moerdler at Bernstein, a broker.
As for the transition to the cloud, it need not be onerous technically. That is a bit of red herring, thinks Paul Sanderson of Gartner. The bigger challenge is changing the culture of sap, which has become too removed from its clients.
Rivals will try to exploit the transition period to win over some of those customers. Larry Ellison, the colourful co-founder and now chief technology officer of Oracle, declared last year that ""sap's customer base is up for grabs."" His subsequent claim that a huge client of sap was about to defect to Oracle proved unfounded. Another such boast might not be."

Uber is selling its supposedly vital autonomous-vehicle division
In 2016 travis kalanick, then Uber's chief executive, described self-driving cars as mission-critical. If somebody managed to beat Uber to making them work, he said, then the rival's ability to offer taxi trips without paying for human drivers would mean that ""Uber is no longer a thing.""
Times change. On December 7th Uber announced the sale of its self-driving arm to a firm called Aurora. No price was given. But Uber said it would put another $400m into the unit; that Dara Khosrowshahi, its current boss, would join Aurora's board; and that the deal would leave it with a 26% stake in Aurora.
One reason for the spin-off is Uber's belated effort to return to profit. It lost $8.5bn in 2019, as it fought for market share with rivals such as Lyft. Besides offloading the self-driving unit, the firm has sacked workers and sold its Jump electric-bicycle division to Lime, a scooter firm. On December 8th Uber said it would flog its Elevate flying-car project to a startup called Joby Aviation.
Another explanation is that the reality of self-driving has lagged far behind the excitement, as it had done in the idea's earlier heydays in the 1960s and the 1990s. The machine-learning software on which the cars rely often struggles to cope with ""edge cases"", which are absent from software's training data but pop up regularly on real roads.
Uber's self-driving progress has, according to industry rumours, been slow. In 2018 one of its cars ran over and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. It is not alone; Tesla's ""Autopilot"" feature has been linked to at least four deaths since it was launched in 2015. But Uber's Kalanick-era reputation for rule-breaking has made the pr burden heavier.
The bearish interpretation of the sale is that, having given up on self-driving, Uber will remain a fancy taxi-and-delivery firm. But if Aurora can buck expectations and make self-driving work, Uber could license the technology back. And high-tech distractions like self-driving cars-or flying ones-may be the last thing the firm needs. It is under pressure not just from rivals and investors but also from regulatory probes into its other big cost-saving innovation-the assertion that its drivers are not employees, but independent contractors. Joe Biden, America's president-elect, has called that a ""misclassification"". Tighter European rules will come into force by 2022. Those edge cases look urgent."

If dinner parties were permitted in locked-down France, it is not hard to guess what would set le tout Paris aflutter. For months bankers, politicians and other pre-covid canapé-scoffers have taken sides in a corporate battle royale pitting two century-old firms against each other. Veolia, a water- and waste-management utility, has been struggling to gobble up Suez, a rival which is resisting fiercely. The proposed deal is mired in legal disputes, boardroom recriminations and ministerial intrigue. All grist to the mill for those who see French business as the product of its politicians' dirigiste tendency to shape the private sector in the mould of the public one. But look at the wider French business landscape and the stereotype is out of date. Away from the clutches of politicians, many French firms have become world-beaters. Is this thanks to the attention of elected officials-or in spite of it?
The ugly spat between Veolia and Suez shows politics still matters in Parisian business circles. Given the two firms offer the same outsourced environmental services to customers dotted across the globe, a tie-up has long been mooted. Veolia having already seized nearly a third of its target's shares, each side has lined up members of l'establishment to make its case. Their brief is not so much to convince shareholders of the merits of a deal, as might be the case in Britain or America. Rather, politicians whose assent is considered critical are an important audience. Suez and Veolia are each said to have a former speechwriter to President Emmanuel Macron lobbying for them (not the same one). Given that a slew of legal challenges and regulatory clearances is required, the outcome will not be known for months. Few think it will hinge on the transaction's commercial merits.
Such intrigue used to delight the French business elite. Now it feels old hat. Look at the top of the cac 40 index of France's leading companies today, and a new generation of firms has emerged. Two decades ago the corporate league table was dominated by firms in sectors in which relations with government matter, such as telecoms, utilities or banking. The bosses of France Télécom or bnp Paribas, a bank, were inevitably former ministerial advisers. More often than not they had graduated from the École Nationale d'Administration (ena), a finishing school for public officials.
Fast forward to today and the cac 40 is led by companies with less use for political connections. The index's brightest stars today are luxury giants such as lvmh (of Louis Vuitton fame), Kering (Gucci) and Hermes; L'Oréal, a beauty-products firm; Sanofi, a drugmaker; and a host of industrial giants. Selling handbags or skincare products to Chinese yuppies is a global contest in which French firms excel, thanks to competent management. Lesserknown but equally astute companies such as Schneider Electric, a specialist in energy-management kit, have outperformed American rivals such as 3м and General Electric, and European ones like Siemens and abb. Investors in Air Liquide, a chemicals firm, have enjoyed juicier returns than those of Germany's basf or America's DuPont. Publicis, an advertising group, is worth nearly three times as much as in 2000, while rivals like wpp in Britain and Omnicom in America have lost market value. EssilorLuxottica, a French-Italian firm, is the world's biggest purveyor of spectacles.
Even more telling, some big firms began to prosper only once unshackled from the government yoke. Total, an oil-and-gas major, used to be worth a fraction of bp or Royal Dutch Shell. As it has gained distance from the corridors of power since privatisation in 1992, it has caught up with its European rivals' valuations. Safran, an aerospace firm, has seen its market value go up 14-fold in two decades as the state has sold down its stake. Airbus has outpaced its American jetmaking nemesis, Boeing, as political meddling (by the many European governments that founded it) has ebbed.
And today political allies carry less heft than they once did. According to Morgan Stanley, a bank, over 70% of big French firms' revenues nowadays come from overseas, where French politicians hold little sway. Most regulation critical to French firms used to be done at national level, where regulators were drawn from the same ena lecture halls as corporate bosses. Now a lot is carried out by European or global watchdogs.
That is not to say that big firms and politicians steer clear of each other. France's foreign minister recently waded into lvmh's takeover of Tiffany, an American jeweller, in ways that were eyebrow-raisingly useful for the French luxury champion. But direct patronage is becoming a burden. The French authorities remain a shareholder in Renault and in 2019 clumsily handled a proposed merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, an Italian-American rival (whose big shareholder, Exor, owns a stake in The Economist's parent company). Peugeot, a nimble competitor with no direct state shareholding, is now in the midst of the merger Renault fluffed.
French whines
Corporate France has plenty of shortcomings. It has no tech giants to match Google or Amazon. Many large companies with few state ties, such as Accor, a hotel chain, and Carrefour, a retailer, are decidedly ordinary. The cac 40 was lagging behind its European and American equivalents even before covid-19 hit the French economy particularly hard. Its smaller firms pale in comparison to Germany's Mittelstand. And French politicians, though no longer the dirigiste master-planners of yore, still pine for national (or European) champions to take on Chinese rivals. They frown on hostile takeovers-the mere prospect of which serves to sharpen managers' minds-which is one reason the Veolia-Suez deal may fail.
That is a shame. Just ask Danone's shareholders. In 2005 an unsolicited approach by PepsiCo for Danone was foiled by the French authorities on the grounds yogurt-making was a strategic industry. The American firm went on its way and has since delivered fizzy profits for its shareholders. Those at Danone, meanwhile, have had to stomach far blander returns. *"

There are tentative signs that productivity growth might accelerate
The prospects for a productivity resurgence may seem grim. After all, the past decade has featured plenty of technological fatalism: in 2013 Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist, mused of the technological advances of the moment that ""we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters"". Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has echoed this sentiment, speculating that humanity might never again invent something so transformative as the flush toilet. Throughout the decade, data largely supported the views of the pessimists.
What is more, some studies of past pandemics and analyses of the economic effects of this one suggest that covid-19 might make the productivity performance worse. According to research by the World Bank, countries struck by pandemic outbreaks in the 21st century (not including covid) experienced a marked decline in labour productivity of 9% after three years relative to unaffected countries.
And yet, stranger things have happened. The brutal years of the 1930s were followed by the most extraordinary economic boom in history. A generation ago economists had nearly abandoned hope of ever matching the post-war performance when a computer-powered productivity explosion took place. And today there are tantalising hints that the economic and social traumas of the first two decades of this century may soon give way to a new period of economic dynamism.
Productivity is the magic elixir of economic growth. Increases in the size of the labour force or the stock of capital can raise output, but the effect of such contributions diminishes unless better ways are found to make use of those resources. Productivity growth-wringing more output from available resources-is the ultimate source of long-run increases in incomes. It's not everything, as Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics laureate, once noted, but in the long run it's almost everything.
Economists know less about how to boost productivity than they would like, however. Increases in labour productivity (that is, more output per worker per hour) seem to follow improvements in educational levels, increases in investment (which raise the level of capital per worker), and adoption of new innovations. A rise in total factor productivity-or the efficiency with which an economy uses its productive inputs-may require the discovery of new ways of producing goods and services, or the reallocation of scarce resources from low-productivity firms and places to high-productivity ones.
Globally, productivity growth decelerated sharply in the 1970s from scorchingly high rates in the post-war decades. A burst of higher productivity growth in the rich world, led by America, unfolded from the mid-1990s into the early 2000s. Emerging markets, too, enjoyed rapid productivity growth in the decade prior to the global financial crisis, powered by high levels of investment and an expansion of trade which brought more sophisticated techniques and technologies to the developing-economy participants in global supply chains. Since the crisis, however, a broad-based and stubbornly persistent slowdown in 1 productivity growth has set in (see chart 1). About 70% of the world's economies have been affected, according to the World Bank.
Accounting for the slowdown is a fraught process. The World Bank reckons that slowing trade growth and fewer opportunities to adopt and adapt new technology from richer countries may have helped depress productivity advances in the emerging world. Across all economies, sluggish investment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis looks a culprit: a particular problem in places with ageing and shrinking workforces. Yet while these headwinds surely matter, the bigger question is why new technologies like improved robotics, cloud computing and artificial intelligence have not prompted more investment and higher productivity growth.
Broadly speaking, three hypotheses compete to explain these doldrums. One, voiced by the techno-pessimists, insists that for all the enthusiasm about worldchanging technologies, recent innovations are simply not as transformative as the optimists insist. Though it is possible that this will turn out to be correct, continued technological progress makes it look ever less plausible as an explanation for the doldrums. ai may not have transformed the world economy at the dramatically disruptive pace some expected five to ten years ago, but it has become significantly, and in some cases startlingly, more capable. gpt-3, a language-prediction model developed by OpenAi, a research firm, has demonstrated a remarkable ability to carry on conversations, draft long texts and write code in surprisingly human-like fashion.
Though the potential of the web to support an economy in which the constraints of distance do not bind has long underwhelmed, cloud computing and videoconferencing proved their economic worth over the past year, enabling vast amounts of productive activity to continue with scarcely an interruption despite the shuttering of many offices. New technologies are clearly able to do more than has generally been asked of them in recent years.
That strengthens the case for a second explanation for slow productivity growth: chronically weak demand. In this view, expressed most vociferously by Larry Summers of Harvard University, governments' inability to stoke enough spending constrains investment and growth. More public investment is needed to unlock the economy's potential. Chronically low rates of interest and inflation, limp private investment and lacklustre wage growth since the turn of the millennium clearly indicate that demand has been inadequate for most of the past two decades. Whether this meaningfully undercuts productivity growth is difficult to say. But in the years before the pandemic, as unemployment fell and wage growth ticked up, American labour productivity growth appeared to be accelerating, from an annual increase of just 0.3% in 2016 to a rise of 1.7% in 2019: the fastest pace of growth since 2010.
But a third explanation provides the strongest case for optimism: it takes time to work out how to use new technologies effectively. ai is an example of what economists call a ""general-purpose technology"", like electricity, which has the potential to boost productivity across many industries. But making best use of such technologies takes time and experimentation. This accumulation of know-how is really an investment in ""intangible capital"".
Recent work by Erik Brynjolfsson and Daniel Rock, of mit, and Chad Syverson, of the University of Chicago, argues that this pattern leads to a phenomenon they call the ""productivity J-curve"". As new technologies are first adopted, firms shift resources towards investment in intangibles: developing new business processes. This shift in resources means that firm output suffers in a way that cannot be fully explained by shifts in the measured use of labour and tangible capital, and which is thus interpreted as a decline in productivity growth. Later, as intangible investments bear fruit, measured productivity surges because output rockets upward in a manner unexplained by measured inputs of labour and tangible capital.
Back in 2010, the failure to account for intangible investment in software made little difference to the productivity numbers, the authors reckon. But productivity has increasingly been understated; by the end of 2016, productivity growth was probably about 0.9 percentage points higher than official estimates suggested.
This pattern has occurred before. In 1987 Robert Solow, another Nobel prizewinner, remarked that computers could be seen everywhere except the productivity statistics. Nine years later American productivity growth began an acceleration which evoked the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s. These processes are not always sexy. In the late 1990s, the soaring share prices of internet startups hogged the headlines. The fillip to productivity growth had other sources, like improvements in manufacturing techniques, better inventory management and rationalisation of logistics and production processes made possible by the digitisation of firm records and the deployment of clever software.
The J-curve provides a way to reconcile tech optimism and adoption of new technologies with lousy productivity statistics. The role of intangible investments in unlocking the potential of new technologies may also mean that the pandemic, despite its economic damage, has made a productivity boom more likely to develop. Office closures have forced firms to invest in digitisation and automation, or to make better use of existing investments. Old analogue habits could no longer be tolerated. Though it will not show up in any economic statistics, in 2020 executives around the world invested in the organisational overhauls needed to make new technologies work effectively (see chart 2). Not all of these efforts will have led to productivity improvements. But as covid-19 recedes, the firms which did transform their activities will retain and build on their new ways of doing things.
The crisis forced change
Early evidence suggests that some transformations are very likely to stick, and that the pandemic quickened the pace of technology adoption. A survey of global firms conducted by the World Economic Forum this year found that more than 80% of employers intend to accelerate plans to digitise their processes and provide more opportunities for remote work, while 50% plan to accelerate automation of production tasks. About 43% expect changes like these to generate a net reduction in their workforces: a development which could pose labour-market challenges but which almost by definition implies improvements in productivity.
Harder to assess is the possibility that the movement of so much work into the cloud could have productivity-boosting effects for national economies or at the global level. High housing and property costs in rich, productive cities have locked firms and workers out of places where they might have done more with less resources. If tech workers can more easily contribute to top firms while living in affordable cities away from America's coasts, say, then strict zoning rules in the bay area of California will become less of a bottleneck. Office space in San Francisco or London freed up by increases in remote work could be occupied by firms which really do need their workers to operate in close physical proximity. Beyond that, and politics permitting, the boost to distance education and telemedicine delivered by the pandemic could help drive a period of growth in services trade, and the achievement of economies of scale in sectors which have long proved resistant to productivity-boosting measures.
None of this can be taken for granted. Making the most of new private-sector investments in technology and know-how will require governments to engineer a rapid recovery in demand, to make complementary investments in public goods like broadband, and to focus on tackling the educational shortfalls so many students have suffered as a consequence of school closures. But the raw materials for a new productivity boom appear to be falling into place, in a way not seen for at least two decades. This year's darkness may in fact mean that dawn is just over the horizon."

It is better to be lucky than good. This is the customary quip of poker players who owe success in a big pot to an improbable draw from the deck. In card games it is usually clear whom fortune has favoured. Not so in investing. The randomness of financial markets makes it hard to distinguish a good investor from a lucky one. It is especially hard for people to assess their own skills.
This long-understood problem has fresh resonance. In the spring no-cost brokerages that cater to small investors reported a surge in new accounts and in trading activity. Many of these newbie investors made money. ""Learning from Noise"", a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Financial Economics by Santosh Anagol, Vimal Balasubramaniam and Tarun Ramadorai, sheds light on how these investors might misinterpret their success. Their study's main finding is that retail investors who were randomly allocated shares in successful Indian ipos view their good fortune as evidence of skill. There are dangers for new investors in misunderstanding the markets. But the bigger hazard might lie in misunderstanding themselves.
India is fertile ground for the study of retail investing. Its regulators require companies to set aside up to 35% of the shares issued in an ipo to small shareholders. Each ipo has a minimum allotment size. Where there is lots of interest from retail investors, there may not be enough small lots to go round. In such cases shares are allocated randomly by lottery. The ""Learning from Noise"" paper is based on a sample of 85 of the 240 ipos that took place in India between March 2007 and March 2012. Of these, 54 were subject to lotteries. The study's main focus is the randomly allocated ipos that enjoyed a first-day increase in price- which is most of them.
ipo lotteries create a natural experiment. Some retail investors (the treatment group) get shares and some (the control group) do not. The two groups have similar characteristics. What separates them is sheer luck. Yet they subsequently behave very differently. The treatment group are more active in trading shares other than the allocated stock in the period after an ipo that enjoys a first-day ""pop"" in its price. Trading volume is 7.4 percentage points higher after two months than for the control group. The difference in trading activity fades over time but is still marked six months after the ipo.
Hyperactive trading by lottery winners cannot be put down to their skill at picking stocks. After all, lottery losers opt for the same ipo stocks, they pick the same winners, but they do not trade as actively. Lottery winners seem to draw something else from their involvement. Perhaps the lived experience of positive returns leads to naive extrapolation-the lesson learned being that stocks go up, so you should buy more of them. But lottery winners respond to good luck by churning their portfolios: they buy more stocks and they also sell more. Having ruled out other explanations the authors plump for the likeliest remaining one-that retail investors ""misinterpret random gains and losses as signals about their own ability"". They misconstrue noise as information. They mistake luck for skill.
This seems to confirm much of the prevailing wisdom about retail investors-that they have a habit of overtrading to the detriment of their returns and this tendency is linked to overconfidence. It sits comfortably alongside the psychology literature, which says people often interpret results in ways that are favourable to their self-image. But there is a bit more to this study. Investors, it seems to suggest, might suffer from ""under-confidence"" as well as overconfidence.
Those in the treatment group who were allocated ipo stocks that went down in value on the first day's trading subsequently traded less actively than the control group. They took bad luck as a sign of an absence of skill. The paper also casts light on how people learn about themselves. The best investors are often introspective, but many people reflect on themselves as an external observer would-by watching their own actions. You notice that you took part in a successful ipo. You then infer from this that you must be good at trading stocks.
There are stock traders who are genuinely good and not merely lucky. But the number of investors who can trade in and out of shares frequently and profitably is vanishingly small. The ""Learning from Noise"" study shows how easy it might be for you to convince yourself that you are one of them. But it is probably wise to assume that you are not."

Financial exclusion will hamper recovery from the pandemic
For most Mexicans online shopping goes like this: people order their goods on Amazon or Mercado Libre, an Argentine ecommerce site that is Latin America's biggest, but pay in cash at a convenience store. That is no surprise given only 37% of Mexicans over 15 years old have a bank account, according to the World Bank. Some 86% of all payments in Mexico are in cash.
Mexico is an anomaly both in Latin America and among emerging-economy peers such as Kenya and India. In those places 54%, 82% and 80% of people are banked respectively, despite Mexico being richer. Its gdp per person is close to $20,400, around three to four times higher than in Kenya and India.
This shortfall is not just inconvenient. Counting cash adds to business costs, and those without accounts have little access to credit, slowing consumption and investment. The good news is that the country is improving financial inclusion, says Pablo Saavedra, who heads the World Bank's Mexico programme. Only 27% of Mexicans had an account in 2011, but the pandemic has made the issue ""even more urgent"", he says.
There are several reasons why so few Mexicans have access to financial services. Banks are generally conservative. Condusef, the financial watchdog, says bank fees in Mexico are high, with 30% of banks' income coming from commissions. In rural areas, branches can be hard to reach. Furthermore, banks tend not to be interested in the less well-off: only a fifth of the poorest 20% of Mexicans have accounts. Surveys show many Mexicans do not trust banks. Meanwhile, almost 60% work in the informal sector, where they may receive an inconsistent income, in cash. The lack of access affects some more than others-the poor, rural, women and indigenous people.
Successive Mexican governments have tried to improve access to financial institutions. In 2018, a law was introduced to regulate the fintech industry, which is now booming. Under Andrés Manuel López Obrador (known as amlo) CoDi, a digital payment system using qr codes and contactless payments was introduced in 2019 while financial literacy was included in the school curriculum in September 2020 (currently schooling is via television during the pandemic). Much still needs to be done to hit the government's goal of 65% of Mexicans having an account by 2024.
Mexico has also missed a chance provided by the pandemic that other countries have seized. Euromoney, a financial publication, points out that by the end of June 2m people in Colombia had opened bank accounts, compared with 1.4m in all of 2019. Contrast that with Mexico, where the amount of cash in circulation was up by almost 24% in November compared with the year previously, which the Bank of Mexico attributes primarily to the pandemic. One reason for the difference is that Colombia has given handouts to the population, which must be deposited into a bank account, whereas amlo has been far stingier with support during the crisis.
Newer firms in the private sector are now driving growth, with online-only and challenger banks seeing a rise in demand for their services. Norman Müller, the cofounder of Fondeadora, a challenger bank that received $14m from Alphabet's venture arm, says of the 250,000 accounts that have been opened since it launched in June 2019, 40% were with people who were previously unbanked (the other 60% were ""unhappily banked"", he says). He puts Fondeadora's success down to an understanding that ""our competitor is cash, not other banks"" and making the platform as simple and transparent as possible. Since almost everyone owns a mobile phone, mobile money should grow, too.
The current low level of financial inclusion is likely to hamper Mexico's economic recovery from covid-19, which has been muted by a failure to control the pandemic. For example, small and medium businesses provide 95% of Mexico's private-sector employment but only 13% have access to formal credit. Under such circumstances ""it is very hard to see how you have a strong recovery,"" says Mr Saavedra. *"

NEW YORK
Oil's cartel may end its age of restraint
Cartels exist to exert control. This year the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec) and its allies have occasionally seemed to prefer chaos. In March Saudi Arabia and Russia began a price war just as covid-19 crushed demand, akin to staging a fight atop a sinkhole. The group agreed in April to slash output, but at a big meeting in December oil ministers took days longer than expected to decide their next steps. The deal that emerged on December 3rd was a relief to the market, as the group agreed to lift production in January by a modest 500,000 barrels a day.
Beyond January, however, opec and its allies planned not to plan. Any changes to production will be decided in monthly meetings. That is in part because it is difficult to predict oil's recovery. It is also because the new year may mark the beginning of a new strategy.
It is a risky time to test new tactics. The oil market has begun a faltering comeback, with China refining a record 14.1m barrels a day in October and demand picking up in India, too. Promising data on vaccines in November helped buoy prices to their highest levels since March. But storage tanks and ships are still swollen with some 3.8bn barrels of crude, nearly 10% above the level the same time last year, according to Kpler, a data firm. Brent crude, the international benchmark, jumped to almost $50 on December 4th, after the opec deal. By December 8th prices had dipped again, as optimism about Britain's covid vaccine roll-out was doused by uncertainty over further lockdowns.
Yet it is plain that key oil producers are tired of limiting output in ways that support rivals. Capping production to maximise prices makes sense in a world of infinitely growing demand and scarce resources. However oil demand may soon peak, if it hasn't already, due to energy efficiency, electric cars and rising support for climate regulation. In that context, saving oil riches for later looks increasingly misguided. Furthermore, competitors are happy to free ride on opec's cuts. In 2016 the cartel and its partners agreed to curb production, providing a price support. That boosted American frackers and depressed opec's market share, from 38% in 2016 to 34% last year.
Russia's reluctance to support American oilmen spurred the price war in March. In recent months the United Arab Emirates (uae), a core opec producer, has aired its own objections. Like Russia, the uae has worked to raise output (see chart). By 2030 it hopes production capacity will climb by nearly 25%, to 5m barrels a day. To that end, in November it said it had found 24bn barrels-worth of oil tucked beneath Abu Dhabi. opec's new deal reflects an eagerness to ensure such efforts pay off. The cartel and its allies want to provide oil markets with some stability, but not enough to lift output significantly elsewhere and chomp at their own market share. ""You can't assume blindly that opec will always be there to support prices,"" says Damien Courvalin of Goldman Sachs, a bank.
That uncertainty may continue to weigh on shale production in 2021, further draining investors' appetite to finance more capital spending. On December 8th America's Energy Information Administration forecast that the country's oil output would reach 11.4m barrels a day by the end of 2021. That is up from 11.2m barrels a day in November but still below the 12.2m average for 2019. *"

More financial firms are setting climate targets
Financial firms produce very few greenhouse-gas emissions directly, aside from those associated with keeping the lights on and the computers whirring. But the picture changes dramatically when you add ""financed emissions"", those associated with a firm's lending and investing activities. Figures from the few banks and asset managers that disclose them suggest that financed emissions are 100 to 1,000 times bigger than operational ones.
Financed emissions are now coming under more scrutiny from climate-conscious clients and campaigners, and lenders are hoping to manage the associated reputational and regulatory risks. Green regulation, for instance, could damage the viability of an investment. On November 30th Barclays, a British bank, published plans for its net-zero target. Its goal will be to cut emissions from deals it arranges in the capital markets as well as on its loans.
In September Morgan Stanley announced it would reach net-zero financed emissions by 2050. In October similar pledges were made by hsbc and JPMorgan Chase, banks from Britain and America respectively. The Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group of 30 investors with $5trn of assets under management, recently set targets for its members. Advocates hope the targets will be met either by divesting dirty assets or pressing polluters to clean up their act. But matters will not be so simple.
For a start, assessing the emissions associated with a portfolio is fiendishly complex. Many methodologies have emerged, each with their own drawbacks. One approach tries to capture a portfolio's carbon footprint. Here, the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (pcaf) is the frontrunner. But the lack of data is a problem; small firms rarely disclose emissions. hsbc says climate-related data are provided by only 12% of its loan portfolio.
As a result, pcaf users rely on sector averages to fill in the gaps. Double-counting is endemic. Take the emissions from an office block that has a mortgage and is let out. They could be counted by the mortgage lender, any firm financing the companies using the office or even a firm financing the city where the office is located.
Another complication is divvying up emissions between various investors. pcaf's approach is to use enterprise value (equity plus debt) as a base. A bank lending $10m to a firm with an enterprise value of $100m would be responsible for a tenth of the firm's emissions. But the value of an asset changes over time. If a company's market value increases or if it takes on more debt, a lender's share of the enterprise value would shrink. The lenders' carbon footprint would fall through no action of its own. (pcaf says it is working on a fix.)
A second approach to gauging greenness is to see whether the portfolio is aligned with the Paris agreement, which aims to keep warming at less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The 2 Degrees Investing Initiative (2DIi), a think-tank, looks at the assets and production of portfolio companies to work out if, say, a carmaker is building enough electric vehicles to meet the Paris goals. But many asset classes are not included.
A third approach assigns a temperature score to portfolios. This represents how much the Earth would heat up by 2100, if the carbon intensity of the global economy were the same as a given portfolio. Scientists think the Earth is on course for 3 to 4°C of warming above pre-industrial levels. Financial firms that have totted up their portfolio found a similar result.
The score depends heavily on the approach used, though. A study led by Julie Raynaud of McGill University in Canada looked at 12 different methods. Some of those included the emissions from a firm's supply chain in their calculations, for instance, but others did not. Another difference was whether companies were assumed to hit their net-zero targets. These kinds of variations led to different results. When the same index of low-carbon companies was analysed by the 12 methods, they produced scores ranging from 1.5°C to 4°C-a huge difference, in climate terms.
One hope is that regulators will force more rigour. They are worried that climate change poses a systemic risk to the financial sector and are demanding more information on financed emissions. Calculating the carbon in a portfolio is part of climate stress-tests, which will soon be conducted in Britain, France and Australia. On November 27th the European Central Bank said it will follow suit. A push towards more climate-risk disclosure could eventually require financed emissions data to be published, too.
Even then, the climate impact of banks hitting their targets will be unclear. A study by 2DII found that the holdings of coal plants by Swiss financial institutions, as measured by generating capacity, fell by 20% between 2017 and 2020. Yet the coal firms found funding elsewhere. By 2020, the original cohort of firms in the 2017 portfolio had increased capacity by 50%. Banks with zero-carbon loan books will attract clients, but may not help the planet. *"

An old joke: a policeman sees an inebriated man searching for his keys under a lamp post and offers to help find them. After a few fruitless minutes, the officer asks the man whether he's certain he dropped his keys at that particular location. No, says the man, he lost them in the park. Then why search here, asks the officer. The man answers: ""Because that's where the light is."" For years, the story has been used to illustrate the simple point, of great relevance to social scientists, that what you find depends on where you look. And for much of its history, economics has examined a very narrow set of countries. An analysis by The Economist of more than 900,000 papers published in economics journals (see Graphic detail), finds that as recently as 1990, roughly two-thirds of published papers focused on the rich English-speaking countries: America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.
A boom in the emerging world and a greater focus within economics on empirical work have broadened the reach of the lamplight. The share of papers mentioning countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia or Latin America has risen from 17% in 1990 to 41% today. Yet many parts of the world, such as poor African countries, remain heavily under-studied. Even within regions, some places receive outsized attention. A recent survey of Africa by Obie Porteous of Middlebury College found that 65% of papers about African economies published in the leading five economics journals focus on just five: Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, and Malawi. Some overlooked places might count that a blessing; attention from economists has not always been followed by economic success. But the more of the world that economists study, the better their guidance is likely to be. It is thus in everyone's interest for the profession to continue to broaden its geographic reach.
Patterns of economic research are mostly explained by just a few factors. The size of a country's economy is the most significant, accounting for nearly 80% of the variation in research attention, according to our analysis. The importance of economic output in shaping research choices has a certain logic. Developed, complex economies provide rich terrain for scholars to explore. If the lessons learned from large economies can be translated into better policy in those places, then such research stands to benefit more people than if scholars focused on minnows. (About half of humanity lives within the world's ten largest economies.) The quality and availability of data matter too, though less than economic size, as does a country's use of English. About 90% of the papers in our sample are written in English.
Professional incentives also play a role. An analysis by the World Bank of more than 76,000 empirical papers published between 1985 and 2004 found that top-five economics journals published about 6.5% of all papers written about America over that span, compared with just 1.5% of papers about other nations. Top economists are more likely to write about America. And even if you adjust for the prestige of the authors' institutions it does not entirely eliminate the gap.
Do countries which receive less attention necessarily suffer as a consequence? The recent increase in developing-world research has not been an unalloyed good. It has been driven, in part, by the rise of the randomised controlled trial-in which scholars randomly assign participants to different groups, only some of which receive a ""treatment"" (like a microloan or access to education). Well-constructed experiments can provide valuable guidance on how best to alleviate the worst harms of poverty. Yet critics argue that such trials provide little information about how to generate sustained economic development. They also raise ethical questions: regarding whether desperate people and governments can truly give informed consent, for example. As Angus Deaton, a Nobel laureate, noted in 2019, such experiments are nearly always conducted ""by better-heeled, better-educated and paler people on lower income, less-educated and darker people"", creating a persistent risk of exploitation.
However, countries dogged by poor policy stand to benefit most from rigorous examinations of how bad policies fail. According to The Economist's analysis, regional success stories, like Chile or the Czech Republic, receive far more attention than you would expect given their underlying characteristics relative to failing places in the same regions, like Venezuela or Belarus. Reformminded governments in understudied places, should they come to power, could be hamstrung by a dearth of quality research, outlining how past missteps contributed to present penury. Research biases could also mean that too little light is shone on the failures of interventions by institutions like the imf which may have exacerbated the problems of struggling countries.
Attention, please
Indeed, another reason for economists to spend more time on under-examined places is that a broadening of horizons would improve the profession itself, and thus enable economists to serve governments better. There are too many unanswered questions in economics for some corners of humanity to receive so little attention. The 70 least-studied countries account for just 1% of all mentions in economics papers over the past three decades.
And while the profession's increasing focus on empirical work is welcome, concentrating research within the cone of light that data provide means that some questions are asked much more often than others: in particular, those which can be answered with statistical analysis. An effort to pay more attention to the places least able to provide high-quality data, which often face the toughest roads to development, would force economists to grapple with qualitative matters. If critical contributions to development come from difficult-to-quantify variations in cultural factors, a geographically limited discipline will find it hard to detect them. And both the world and the profession will be poorer for it. *"

Some people would like to replace hydrocarbon aviation fuel with hydrogen. Is that actually practical?
In the swamps of 1950s Florida, a loud roaring occasionally disturbed the serenity of the local alligators. Under conditions of strictest secrecy, engineers from Pratt & Whitney, an aerospace company, were testing a new type of engine that was powered by a strange substance apparently piped in from a fertiliser plant in the nearby town of Apix. In reality, the town was just a name on a map and the fertiliser plant was a ruse to fool the Russians. The disturbances were the result of Project Suntan, an attempt by America's air force to build a plane fuelled with hydrogen. It nearly worked. The engines operated successfully, but storing and supplying the hydrogen itself proved too expensive for production to continue.
Suntan was just the first of a string of failed attempts to use hydrogen to power heavier-than-air flight. The allure is great. Hydrogen packs three times as much energy per kilogram as kerosene, the current standard aviation fuel, and lightness is at a premium aloft. Tupolev, in what was then the Soviet Union, tried in the 1980s. Boeing tried in the 2000s. A small demonstrator has flown in Germany. But nothing has, as it were, really taken off. Hydrogen, though light, is bulky, making it awkward to store on board. It must be either pressurised or liquefied, both of which bring complications of their own. On top of that, there is no established infrastructure for making and distributing it.
This time it's different
Now, though, things have changed. Aviation is under pressure to curb carbon-dioxide emissions by burning less kerosene. And talk of building hydrogen-manufacturing-and-delivery infrastructure for other purposes, such as heating and ground transport, is getting serious, meaning that hydrogen might become available as a commodity, rather than having to be made specially. The balance of advantage may thus be shifting. So a few brave souls are looking once again at the idea of hydrogenpowered flight.
Project Suntan used the stuff in the way that kerosene is used-to create the heat needed to power a jet engine. That is one way forward. But many planes are driven by propellers, and this permits a second approach, for propellers can be turned by electric motors. Using fuel cells, a 19thcentury technology that is now coming into its own, it is possible to generate the electricity needed to do so with hydrogen.
This is the tack taken by ZeroAvia, a firm based in Cranfield, in southern Britain. In September ZeroAvia's engineers unveiled a six-seater fuel-cell-powered aircraft that could take off, complete two circuits of the airport, and land. The plane in question is a modified Piper M-class-a single-propeller aircraft that is normally driven by a piston engine. The engineers replaced this with an electric motor, and installed a bank of fuel cells to power that motor and a set of tanks to hold the hydrogen which runs the fuel cells.
Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia's boss, hopes to see this demonstrator take a 400km trip, tentatively scheduled for the week of December 21st, followed by a longer flight from Orkney, an archipelago off the northern tip of Britain, next spring. (Orkney's authorities are interested in ""hopper"" planes that can link the archipelago's islands.) The firm also plans to have a 20-seat demonstrator ready in 2021. Certification for commercial use might follow in 2023.
Hot on the heels of ZeroAvia is H2Fly, a spin-off from dlr, Germany's aeronautical research centre. In 2016 this firm added fuel cells to a motorised Pipistrel glider, which then stayed aloft for 15 minutes. The plan is to extend that approach to a productionversion propeller-driven plane in tests to be conducted imminently. Meanwhile, in America, an electric-motor manufacturer called magniX has announced a partnership with Universal Hydrogen, a firm in Los Angeles, to convert a 40-seat de Havilland Canada Dash 8-300 to run on fuel cells. This, they hope, will be ready by 2025.
Such approaches seem likely to work in principle. They will, though, have to compete in practice with electric aircraft powered by batteries. In May, an American firm called AeroTEC flew a nine-seater Cessna Caravan that had been converted to battery power through the skies above Washington state. The previous December, magniX collaborated with Harbour Air, a Canadian company, to fly a converted de Havilland seaplane in British Columbia. The two firms are now busy preparing this aircraft for commercial certification. More ambitiously, several companies, such as Eviation, an Israeli outfit, are attempting to build battery-driven aircraft from scratch rather than converting existing airframes.
Batteries not included
Proponents of fuel cells say, though, that these are better than batteries for powering flight because the cells plus their associated fuel store many times more energy per kilogram than batteries can manage. ""Batteries really give you the acceleration. But they won't give you the range,"" says Robert Steinberger-Wilckens, a chemical engineer at the University of Birmingham, in Britain. Battery technology is improving, but big breakthroughs will be needed before longer journeys with passengers and freight on board become possible.
Sticking electric power sources in an existing aircraft, whether in the form of batteries or fuel cells, is a start. But such propulsion could lead to significant redesigns, such as the one Eviation is planning for its putative product, Alice. This has three propellers, all of which face backward. Though once popular, backward-facing propellers have been out of fashion for decades. Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft- people-carrying drones sometimes touted as the future of personal transport-are also often powered by multiple smaller electric motors, making them a good fit with fuel-cell-based hydrogen power.
Bigger machines have bigger problems. It requires much more power for a plane to take off and land than to cruise, and neither batteries nor fuel cells yet have the oomph to do this for other than small aircraft. If larger ones are to be hydrogen-powered, that will require at least part of the work to be done by returning to the Project Suntan route and employing turbine-driven engines that burn the stuff as a gas.
That approach is now being adopted by Airbus, a European firm which shares with Boeing of America a duopoly on large passenger planes. In September Airbus unveiled ZERoe, a project centred on three hydrogen-powered concept aircraft. Though these are single-aisle short-haul models, they are a step up from anything that might be powered solely by fuels cells.
All three are designed to yoke the two hydrogen-based technologies together, with hydrogen-burning turbine engines boosting take-off and fuel cells powering the cruise. One of the concepts is a turboprop that would carry up to 100 passengers for distances up to 2,000km. A larger turbofan version would take twice that load twice as far. The third approach is more experimental: a ""blended wing"" model, in which fuselage and aerofoils form part of the same triangular aerodynamic structure. The advantage of this is that it creates extra volume for hydrogen storage.
The challenges of using hydrogen go beyond body shape, though. Redesigning a turbine engine to run on the stuff will be a multi-billion-dollar endeavour. Hydrogen burns faster than kerosene, and also burns hotter. That means materials exposed to its combustion experience greater stresses. It also risks increasing the pollution generated in the form of oxides of nitrogen, which would partially negate the environmental benefits of burning hydrogen. And it would be useful as well to arrange matters so that some of the energy used to compress or liquefy the hydrogen for storage could be recovered and put to work.
For the next few years, Airbus will focus on developing the twin technologies of fuel-cells and hydrogen-powered turbines in parallel with the design of their future aircraft. If ground tests succeed, the firm hopes to have airborne demonstrators- what Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus's vice-president for zero-emission aircraft, calls flying testbeds-aloft by 2025. A full-scale prototype would follow by the end of the decade, with the first zero-emission commercial airliner entering service by 2035. Who would supply the engines for such a plane is not yet clear. But Safran, a French enginemaker that often works with Airbus, has confirmed it is looking at hydrogen power for commercial aircraft.
So far, Boeing has not followed suit. This geographical split may be no coincidence. eu public policy is firmly green, as is public policy in Britain, no longer a member of the eu but the site of several Airbus facilities. eu policy in particular translates into actual money for relevant research via the union's Clean Sky 2 programme.
No such support, either moral or financial, has been on offer in America over the past four years. Joe Biden's incoming administration, however, seems of one mind with Europe on matters environmental. And this new direction is likely, as in Europe, to be accompanied by public money. Boeing, moreover, would be taking a gamble by leaving hydrogen-power to Airbus. If the technology succeeded, it would risk losing an important part of its market- and that is something it certainly cannot afford to do. *"

Super-loudhailers are about to become louder still
You need a pretty powerful bullhorn to broadcast a message to someone who is 2km away. But that is what America's navy is currently looking for. It wants, among other things, to be able to warn the crews of small vessels, who may or may not be hostile, not to come too close to its ships. And, if the warning is ignored, it would like to be able to hit them with a noise so piercing and horrible that even a determined attacker would have difficulty ignoring it and carrying on regardless.
To some extent, it can do this already. After USS Cole, a guided-missile destroyer, was attacked successfully by boat-borne suicide-bombers in 2000, ripping a huge hole in the vessel's side (see picture) and 1 killing 17 sailors, America's admirals have been understandably nervous about the proximity of such craft. One consequence of that nervousness is that they have acquired so-called Long Range Acoustic Devices (lrads) to hail possible threats. The current top of the range, the 2000RX, generates 160 decibels, while a portable cousin, the 100X, manages 137. But the navy now wants something that combines the former's power with the latter's convenience, and with a higher fidelity of transmission.
Now hear this
The upshot of that desire is a project called Focused Enhanced Acoustic-Driver Technologies (feat) for Long Range Non-Lethal Hail and Warn Capabilities. This will build on a previous effort, the Distributed Sound and Light Array (dsla), that used eight large loudspeakers. feat, if the plans work, will be more compact.
Existing lrads use piezoelectric elements to generate their sound. feat, by contrast, will be similar to a conventional loudspeaker-employing a moving magnet to vibrate a diaphragm or cone. This arrangement works better at low frequencies than piezoelectric sound generation, which is important if voices are to be projected, for lower frequencies make speech easier to understand. They are also better at penetrating buildings and vehicles, to deliver messages to those inside.
Louder loudspeakers, though, require stronger magnets and tougher materials. For the magnets, this may mean a better version of the neodymium devices currently favoured by the speaker industry, or possibly some more exotic material. For the diaphragms, the navy's engineers may be looking at graphene, or possibly synthetic diamond. These allotropes of carbon are both much stronger than conventional speaker materials.
FEAT will combine the outputs of several drivers (the vibrating units that convert an electrical signal into sound), using a technique called beamforming to focus them onto a distant target to create a total volume of more than 156 decibels. Beamforming is widely employed in radio antennae, and the dsla showed that it is equally effective for sound waves. Lastly, and perhaps most ambitiously, feat will include technology intended to cancel atmospheric distortion. This approach improves the focus of laser beams, but has not yet been demonstrated to work for a beam of sound.
The navy is now selecting contractors for a nine-month feasibility study. If that works, the second stage will be to build a prototype for testing by the marine corps. Once deployed, the technology will also be shared with the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and others. This will not be music to everyone's ears, though, for lrads, which are used by some police forces as well as the armed services, are already controversial.
Six people, for example, are suing the New York Police Department for excessive use of force after being exposed to an lrad in 2014. They allege lasting damage, including tinnitus and migraines. In 2019 a federal appeal court took the plaintiffs' side and the case continues. And the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, a group of doctors who work in the area, warns that lrads could cause permanent hearing loss and balance problems, and advises protesters who might encounter them to wear hearing protection. In June, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, ordered police not to use the ""warning tone"" function against protesters.
More powerful sonic devices could save lives by conveying warnings to people in small boats or vehicles approaching checkpoints before they behave, possibly mistakenly, in a way that risks their being fired on. They could also warn occupants of buildings about to be cleared by force, giving bystanders a chance to escape before the shooting starts, and enemy combatants the option to surrender. However, smaller, cheaper devices may prove more prone to misuse than lrads. And if this new technology spills over into the commercial sector, noisy neighbours could wage their own kind of sonic warfare. *"

A failed study, a happy accident and a promising treatment for blindness
In the textbooks, science is simple. You come up with an idea, put it to the test, and then accept it or reject it depending on what your experiments reveal. In the real world, though, things are rarely that straightforward, as a paper just published in Science Translational Medicine shows. In it, a group of researchers led by Patrick YuWai-Man, an ophthalmologist at Cambridge University, investigated a promising new genetic therapy for a hereditary form of blindness. Officially, their study was a failure, for their experiment did not show what the researchers hoped it would. But it was also a smashing success, for 29 of the 37 participants reported big improvements in their vision.
The disease in question is Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (lhon). A defective gene in a sufferer's mitochondria-the tiny structures that provide a cell's energy- causes retinal cells to die. That leads to sudden and rapid loss of sight, with many sufferers becoming legally blind within a year. It affects between one in 30,000 and one in 50,000 people. Men in their 20s and 30s are particularly susceptible. Treatment is limited and not particularly effective.
Since most cases are caused by a mutation in a single gene, lhon is a good candidate for gene therapy, a form of genetic engineering which aims to replace the defective gene with a working one. With that in mind, Dr Yu-Wai-Man and his colleagues loaded up a modified virus with a corrected copy of the gene and injected it into their patients' eyes.
Many viruses can insert their genes into the dna of their hosts. Ordinarily, that is a bad thing, because cells so subverted churn out more copies of the virus. In this case, the hope was that infection would be a good thing. The defanged virus could not reproduce. But it was capable of replacing the damaged gene with a working copy.
Most medical studies make use of a control group, against which the effectiveness of the treatment can be measured. Here, the researchers controlled the experiment by injecting only one of each patient's eyes-chosen at random-with the virus. The other eye was given a sham injection, in which a syringe was pressed against the eye, but nothing came out of it. Using two eyes in the same patient makes for a perfect control: their genetic make-up is identical, and any confounding lifestyle factors are removed from the equation.
Cross-eyes
The surprise came several months into the study. The researchers had hoped to see a big improvement in the treated eyes, compared with the untreated ones. They did not, and for that reason the study failed in its primary objective. Instead, in more than three-quarters of their patients, they saw substantial improvements in both eyes.
On the face of it, that was bizarre. Only one eye had received the treatment, after all. Follow-up studies in monkeys confirmed what the researchers had suspected. The virus, it seems, had found a way to travel from one eye to the other, probably via the optic nerve. Tissue and fluid samples from monkeys given the same treatment as the human patients showed viral dna in both eyes, not just one.
Although it had a happy outcome in this case, the prospect of a gene-therapy virus travelling to places it is not intended to go might worry regulators. Fortunately, the researchers found no trace of the virus elsewhere in the monkeys' bodies, including the visual cortices of their brains. And, though the study was technically a flop, its practical success means that an effective treatment for lhon may at last be in reach. GenSight Biologics, the company that has developed the treatment, has already sent its results to Europe's medical regulator. It hopes to hear back by the end of 2021. *"

It rose to an altitude of 12.5km, cut its three engines and manoeuvred itself parallel with the ground to fall back to Earth. Just before touch down it restarted its engines and lifted itself upright to land. But it came in too fast, and the result can be seen above.

Chemical warfare in the insect world
Honeybees in asia have it rough. Unlike their cousins in North America, where bee-eating hornets have arrived only recently, Asian bees are relentlessly hunted by these giant wasps. Constant attacks have kicked Asian honeybee evolution into high gear and resulted in the insects developing several defensive tactics besides simply using their stings. First, Asian honeybees build their nests as fortresses, with tiny entrances and tough walls. They also hiss aggressively at predators, to warn them they are being monitored. And, if that doesn't work, they can swamp attackers in ""bee balls"", which generate such heat that hornets inside are cooked alive. Now, a study published in plos one, by Heather Mattila of Wellesley College, in Massachusetts, shows that these bees have yet another trick up their sleeves: they shield their homes with dung.
Vespa mandarinia and Vespa soror are known as murder hornets for a reason. When scouts from these species find a honeybee hive they land and leave chemical markers near the entrance. The scouts then return with up to 50 of their kin to launch an attack. Armed with powerful jaws and tough body-armour that makes them resistant to bee stings, the hornets besiege the hive's entrance and try to tear it apart so that they can force their way in. They are attacked by guard bees as they do so, and are sometimes successfully driven away. But not always. Often, they get inside and, once there, each hornet kills thousands of bees. This slaughter paves the way for the hornets to gather the real target of the attack, the brood of larvae developing in the hive. These, they carry away to feed to their own young waiting back at the nest. That obliterates the hive.
Hornet attacks are devastating to apiculture, so there is great interest from beekeepers in finding ways to help their charges keep these predators at bay. When Dr Mattila's co-author Gard Otis, of the University of Guelph, in Canada, learned from a beekeeper in Vietnam that bees there stick globs of water-buffalo dung on their hives after being visited by hornets, it therefore piqued his curiosity.
That, in turn, led Dr Otis, Dr Mattila and their colleagues to visit Vietnam, where they monitored 339 honeybee hives. They discovered that many of these hives were indeed covered in globs of what looked like manure, and that most of these globs were clustered around the hive entrance. When they monitored bees' movements they discovered not only that the bees were collecting buffalo dung, but also that they regularly created globs from faeces collected at a chicken coop and a dung pile in a pig enclosure. Further monitoring of the hives showed that the bees quickly attached hundreds of globs of faeces to their hives after hornet attacks.
Off the mark
To see whether this was a consequence of the chemical marks, Dr Mattila and her colleagues collected extracts from the glands hornets use to secrete the substances involved. They then soaked some filter papers in these extracts and put bits of this material near hive entrances. As a control, they also soaked some filter papers in ether, and distributed those likewise near the entrances of other hives.
The hornet extract provoked a strong response. Within a day of its arrival hive members created an average of 15 nearby globs. The ether prompted an average of only two. This suggests bees are indeed wise to the marking tactics of hornets, and prepare for a potential attack accordingly.
To make sure the globs actually do help bees defend their hives, the team recorded some attacks. A well-globbed-up hive, they found, reduced the amount of time hornets spent trying to break in by 94%.
Why globs of faeces repel hornets remains a puzzle. Dr Mattila speculates that dung contains compounds which antagonise the hornets in some way. Specifically, these would be defensive substances synthesised by the plants that buffalo, pigs and chickens eat. If that idea does indeed turn out to be correct, then it seems Asian honeybees have invented an effective form of chemical warfare."

Several new books assess the spread and peril of far-right ideas in America
Weaponised Words. By Kurt Braddock. Cambridge University Press; 302 pages; $29.99 and £22.99
Oath Keepers. By Sam Jackson. Columbia University Press; 240 pages; $35 and £27
Hate in the Homeland. By Cynthia Miller-Idriss. Princeton University Press; 272 pages; $29.95 and £25
American Zealots. By Arie Perliger. Columbia University Press; 232 pages; $28 and £22
How seriously should anyone take Stewart Rhodes and men like him? Speaking online soon after America's presidential election, he said phalanxes of his armed comrades were waiting outside Washington. Should Donald Trump be ousted, they were ready for a ""bloody fight"".
Mr Rhodes is fond of threatening language. In 2016 his group predicted widespread voter fraud followed by ""catastrophic consequences"". It has urged its members, who include ex-soldiers, to help patrol the Mexican border to deter and harass would-be immigrants.
In his study of the Oath Keepers, as this outfit is known, Sam Jackson of the University at Albany estimates that some 5,000 people may have signed up, while many more sympathise. These folk anticipate a second American revolution and claim violence is legitimate to resist what they call tyranny. In the landscape of America's far right they fit into the category of patriot or militia groups, defined by their hostility to government (other than Mr Trump's). In the typography used by analysts, the other categories, which usually command more attention, are outright racists and nativists, who oppose foreign influences and religions other than Christianity.
Mr Jackson's is one of several new books to warn that America's far right is now more active than at any time since the early 1990s. The Department of Homeland Security agrees, and in testimony to Congress this autumn the fbi's director, Christopher Wray, called the far right-and white supremacists in particular-America's gravest domestic-terror threat. Last year, when 48 people were killed in 16 attacks, was their most lethal in a generation. A previous bout of such violence eased only after an anti-government fanatic, Timothy McVeigh, bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people.
Fractious politics, anger over lockdowns and Mr Trump's nudging encouragement of groups such as the Proud Boys have made 2020 worrying, too. The mostly peaceful Black Lives Matter protests provided cover for both armed vigilantes and a few ""accelerationists"", who hope assaults on police will spur a civil war. The fbi reports that amid demonstrations in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a member of the Boogaloo Bois, a far-right group, used an AK-47 to shoot up a police station, which he then helped burn down. The ""Boog flags are in the air"", he bragged. The same man received money from a fellow Boogalooer who, at roughly the same time, shot dead a policeman in California.
Such co-ordination is relatively-and thankfully-rare. As Arie Perliger of the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, says, a big weakness of right-wing extremists has been that they are fragmented into many organisations, or act entirely alone, in what amounts to a ""leaderless resistance"". In ""American Zealots"", a history of far-right violence over 150 years, Mr Perliger finds that solitary attackers have usually been less deadly than those who conspire and act in concert. That helps explain why, despite having perhaps 12m adherents or sympathisers in America in total, their overall impact has been limited.
There are grim exceptions, however, such as the white supremacist who murdered lipeople at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, or the fanatic who killed 23 shoppers in El Paso the following year. Technology, such as ever-more destructive weapons, is altering the calculus. And as in the case of the Oath Keepers-who dislike Muslims and foreigners as well as government-even without formal co-ordination, ideas (and sometimes personnel) are shared across the far-right spectrum.
Among groups whose avowed focus lies elsewhere, for instance, racism still tends to be a factor. Perpetrators typically express unease about social change, often raging against people of a different race or, sometimes, a different religion or sexuality. Almost all are white men, often poor and badly educated. Whereas the South was historically the epicentre of these crimes, they now happen wherever sizeable numbers of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians live. (Tellingly, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and other anti-government groups were founded as Barack Obama became president.)
From meat to murder
Like demographic anxieties, other factors are perennial yet especially acute at the moment. Kathleen Belew of the University of Chicago has traced how militia groups grow when soldiers return home. The Ku Klux Klan flourished after previous wars, she notes. Deploying large numbers of troops to Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere over two decades has contributed to an uptick in violent activity now. Ms Belew suggests America is ""heading to an uphill peak"" in far-right ructions.
Rhetoric matters, too, especially as it spreads online. In ""Weaponised Words"", Kurt Braddock of American University traces how the language of extremists attracts recruits. But, he says, the words of politicians may be just as dangerous. Mr Braddock warns that Mr Trump and his allies have stirred up talk of resistance to a ""deep state""; he was dismayed when Steve Bannon, the president's former adviser, talked on Twitter about decapitating Mr Wray. Some fantasists act on such words. In October the fbi arrested a group in Michigan who spent months planning to kidnap (and maybe kill) its governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and others. They may have been encouraged by Mr Trump's disparagements of her and his call to ""liberate"" the state.
Similarly, in ""Hate in the Homeland"" Cynthia Miller-Idriss describes how ideas once limited to extremist circles, such as that of a ""demographic replacement""- whereby American citizens will be overrun-are now promoted by mainstream figures such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham of Fox News. She concentrates on the estimated 75,000 active white supremacists who comprise the most threatening strain of the far right. They often have international links, illustrated by some 17,000 Westerners who went to fight in the conflict in Ukraine. Most eagerly share conspiracy theories, especially the anti-Semitic kind that, for example, vilify George Soros, a financier.
Ms Miller-Idriss is most interested in how newcomers are drawn in, including through white-power music or mixed martial arts, notably the ""Confederation of Volkisch Fight Clubs"". Some are swayed by a lobby that promotes meat-eating and claims the left ""want to take away your hamburgers"". Some teenage boys relish dark humour and internet memes, often involving the Nazis (""baking pizzas"" is a preferred euphemism for the Holocaust). The sharing of taboo material is, for many, the start of a path towards extremism.
She is struck by the neatly pressed trousers and white polo shirts of young men who marched in Charlottesville in 2017, chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". Others, whom she calls ""Nipsters"", or Nazi hipsters, sell and wear expensive clothes embroidered with white-supremacist and other symbols. Such ""hate clothing"", Ms Miller-Idriss says, makes the movement more palatable and appealing than did the skinheads and neo-Nazis of the past.
The real threat from the far right, her research suggests, is not that groups such as the Oath Keepers will launch large-scale political violence, let alone a new civil war. The bigger worry is the ""mainstreaming of extremism"": the spread of hateful and violent attitudes so that ever-more people share and promote them. *"

In september the University of Edinburgh expunged the name of David Hume from an ugly teaching block. In response to a student petition, the university agreed that the views of the 18th-century thinker on the possible inferiority of nonwhite races, voiced in a tentative footnote to his essay ""Of National Characters"", ""rightly cause distress today"". Thomas Jefferson, a slave-owner, used almost identical language. So did Immanuel Kant.
In contrast, many thinkers of the Enlightenment argued forcefully for the ""basic unity of humankind"". Johann Gottfried Herder, a German polymath, scorned the notion of race itself, and saw all peoples as related parts of ""the same great painting"". In his epic survey of Enlightened minds, ideas and policies across Europe and the Americas, Ritchie Robertson deems Humestyle prejudice ""indefensible even in its own time"". At least as typical of the era was the ceramic medallion produced by potterphilanthropist Josiah Wedgwood in 1787 to support the abolition of slavery, on which a chained African figure pleads: ""Am I not a man and a brother?"" As this masterly book shows, Wedgwood's brooch better encapsulates the mood of the age: its universal principles, wide-ranging sympathy, social activism-and commercial nous.
The Enlightenment argued fiercely with itself, in terms still in use. When today's Westerners quarrel over race, empire, gender, religion, science, the state or the market, they often do so with weapons and tactics honed three centuries ago. Or more: in 1673 the maverick pastor François Poulain de la Barre wrote in ""On the Equality of the Two Sexes"" that ""there is no such thing as sex"". Yet revisionists like to frame the heyday of the writers, scholars and progressive rulers presented here as ""the apotheosis of hyper-rational calculation"". Supposedly, their influence disenchanted the world and seeded a motley harvest of modern evils from neoliberalism to Stalinism.
Mr Robertson begs to differ. A professor of German at Oxford, he is a champion of the thinkers who promoted ""the advance of reason, good sense and empirical enquiry"" against superstition and tyranny, from the late 17th century until the French revolution. Isaac Newton's gravitation, Adam Smith's political economy, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's cult of sentiment-indeed, Hume's outrageous near-atheism-all feature. But Mr Robertson lays special stress 1 on the pursuit of happiness boldly invoked in the American rebels' Declaration of Independence. That led to the first purposebuilt Enlightenment state-""a very British affair"" in its intellectual foundations. ""The ultimate end of man is happiness,"" claimed Rousseau's fellow-Genevan Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui. By itself reason (which must anyway be ""slave of the passions"", insisted Hume) would not ensure felicity.
So Enlightened happiness became a social task, and an art, pursued not just in the study but the laboratory, library, university, printing-house, coffee-shop and Congress. ""Man is born to live in society,"" affirmed Denis Diderot, tireless instigator of the French ""Encyclopédie"" (1751-72) and a ubiquitous, uplifting presence in these pages. Meanwhile, no priest or despot should curtail the liberty of thought enjoyed by beings endowed with, in Kant's words, ""the universal religion of reason that dwells in every ordinary person"". Slowly, grudging tolerance gave way to a warmer embrace of cultural diversity, given its theoretical framework in Montesquieu's pathbreaking ""Spirit of the Laws"".
Enlightenment intellectuals not only thought big. They wrote long. The ""Encyclopédie"", that ""vast panorama of knowledge"", crams 72,000 articles into 17 volumes. The ""Histoire des deux Indes"" (1770), a monument to cosmopolitan idealism by Diderot and Guillaume Raynal, which documents colonial crimes, runs to 4,353 pages. Mr Robertson's 1,000-page whopper imbibes something of the spirit of these mammoth compendia. Not every reader will choose to plough straight through, from John Locke advocating ""the enjoyment of pleasure"" in 1690 to Hanif Kureishi, a modern author, saluting Enlight- 1 enment liberation from outmoded orthodoxies in 2019. Those who do will find that Mr Robertson sweetens erudition with humanity, much as his subjects did.
This Enlightenment celebrates what Robert Burns, appalled by the suffering of a shot hare, called ""the morality of the heart"". Science and statecraft, which are amply chronicled, yield to compassion, sympathy and a self-critical outlook that welcomes experimentation and changes of mind. Not least among its lessons for today, ""The Enlightenment"" shows how its sages learned ""to manage even Disputes with Civility"". *"

In the early 1790s French revolutionaries commissioned a priest, Henri Grégoire, to take a census of the languages spoken in France. His findings were eventually titled a ""Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language"". Grégoire was a pioneering believer in racial equality, a fact that may seem to fit oddly with his passion for eradicating linguistic diversity. But to him, it made sense: French was the language of liberation, and those without it could be kept in ignorance.
How very French, their British cousins might chuckle. The same people who introduced the metric system and (unsuccessfully) tried to replace the Gregorian calendar can seem to have a mania for top-down reform and standardisation. Now some Britons are chuckling to see this approach enlisted in the name of tolerance: on November 26th the National Assembly passed a law forbidding accent discrimination. If it gets through the French Senate, severe cases-say, denying someone a job because of how they speak-could result in three years in prison, or a fine of €45,000 ($55,000). How very French.
The country certainly has biases to amend. In America regional accents can be heard in the highest office in the land (Donald Trump's New York, George W. Bush's Texan). In Britain the bbc has expanded the variety of accents heard on its broadcasts. By contrast, regional accents in France are far tougher to find in high places. This makes it harder for the French to associate intelligence and competence with anything but standard Parisian. At best French politicians, like some elsewhere, switch between their local accent when in the areas they represent and the standard Parisian kind when in the capital or on television.
And French leaders face more than just condescension. When Jean Castex, who has a notable south-western accent, became prime minister, reactions were predictably patronising. But such snobbery can have serious consequences, notes Jonathan Kasstan of Westminster University. The political editor of France's national broadcaster said Mr Castex's pandemic guidance seemed less credible when delivered in his ""patelin"", or village, accent.
In truth, some other countries are more like France than they may think. Beyond the bbc, it remains common in Britain to hear public figures belittled for how they speak. The liberal left indulges these prejudices, too. Alastair Campbell, erstwhile press secretary to Labour's Tony Blair, mocked the Conservative home secretary, Priti Patel, on Twitter: ""I really would prefer it if we had a home secretary who could pronounce the G at the end of a word."" Here snobbery is dressed up as concern for correct enunciation.
But is a ban on such gibes the answer, in France or elsewhere? The case for one is that it would send a powerful signal: there is no rational reason to withhold a job or a loan because of an applicant's accent. But a specific ban on accent discrimination may not be necessary. Donald Dowling, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson in New York, points out that, in many countries, accent mockery is already used as evidence of other forms of illegal discrimination, such as the racial kind. If you deride a Frenchman for an accent suggesting African origins, you are already breaking the law. In theory that law could be extended to cover (say) Breton origins without specifically adding ""accent"" to protected categories.
In the end, prejudice against accents betrays bad manners and small minds, and says more about the listener than about the put-upon speaker. But often it is itself a sign of poor education. As it happens, Mr Campbell's swipe at Ms Patel's ""g-dropping"" was badly aimed. There is no actual ""g"" sound (as in ""go"") at the end of words ending in -ing; rather, there is a ""velar nasal"", in which the mouth is closed off at the back and air comes from the nose. And the -in' pronunciation he mocks (as in walkin') was the ""correct"" one for centuries, remaining prestigious in the early 1900s.
If more of this were taught in British schools, snobbery would seem irrational. French children might be told that Parisian French was a latecomer, as prestige dialects in France go. Provençal, from France's south, was the language of poetry when the speech of Paris's Île-deFrance region was a trivial local patois.
Speakers of prestigious accents are lucky that they do not face scorn for their speech. But it is just that-luck, not superior learning or care. A law may modify behaviour, but education is a better way to change attitudes."

At 65, William Kentridge is about to unveil his most mesmerising work
Even as he first made his name with his charcoal drawings in the 1970s and 1980s, William Kentridge resented the limitations of his craft. To the young artist he was then, working on his own in a studio in South Africa felt stifling. So he branched out, turning his drawings into filmed animations that brought them to life, then into performances with music and movement, and eventually into complex multimedia installations. He produced operas for the Salzburg Festival and the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
What he loved most was collaborating- with film-makers, theatre companies, musicians. In 2016 he took over the building next to his big industrial studio in downtown Johannesburg and created an incubator for performers called the Centre for the Less Good Idea. The name came from a Tswana proverb about the value of working things out together-and how the first, fizziest brainwave may in the end prove less productive than a humbler idea.
Most evenings, when he is in town, Mr Kentridge can be found at the centre, guiding, rehearsing and experimenting with young performers. Six months ago, though, after he, his wife and numerous colleagues caught covid-19, he was forced to retreat into making art on his own.
The role that solitary labour plays in creativity has long fascinated artists and historians. Lucio Fontana, an Italian-Argentine conceptual artist famous for his ""slashed"" canvases, allowed a photographer to shoot him at work, but only until the knife was poised to touch the canvas; then Fontana insisted on being completely alone. The studio, for him, was a sacred space. Such was the chaos and energy of Francis Bacon's studio in London-with its smeared floor, gunky paint tubes and matted brushes-that after his death the room was painstakingly reconstructed (in 7,000 pieces) in Dublin City Gallery. It was as if his environs could immerse visitors in Bacon's thinking.
For his part, Mr Kentridge headed to a building at the bottom of his garden and began a ""natural history of the studio"", a long-cherished project about the alchemy of art. ""One can think of the studio as a kind of enlarged head,"" he says. ""Instead of ideas moving a few centimetres from one part of your memory to your active thinking, it's the walk across the studio that has the same effect of bringing ideas together and allowing something to emerge.""
His art-loving parents were both antiapartheid lawyers and civil-rights activists; his father defended Nelson Mandela in the ""treason trials"" of 1956-61. As South Africa moved from pariah state to rainbow nation and beyond, Mr Kentridge sought new ways to depict its contested history, environment, injustices and depredations. From his ""Soho Chronicles"" (short animated films) to his productions of Alban Berg's early-20th-century operas, ""Wozzeck"" and ""Lulu"", his themes have been memory, landscape, power, the study of the self and how individuals forge their fates.
The new project will comprise 12 films, each lasting 40 to 45 minutes, far longer and more imaginative than any he has made before. So far, he has completed four. Using an old 16mm Bolex on a tripod, he films himself in conversation with himself, or with two other versions of himself, unpicking the artistic process. He can be the artist-as-maker, clutching a chunk of charcoal and sketching at high speed like a conductor; or the artist-as-critic, assessing his creation from afar. ""Suddenly"", he says, ""you're a very different person.""
Combined with snapshots of his own past, and of South Africa's, this dialogue is mesmerising. The first film, which he shared on his laptop on a flying visit to London, opens with a meditation on a 19thcentury painting of hills and a stream that hung in his grandparents' dining room. Next come memories of a picnic with his parents, involving sardines, boiled eggs and a flask of coffee. The artist argues with himself about small details of the spread, as if he were a pair of squabbling siblings. Then he takes the viewer through a new landscape: the mine dumps that rise out of the flat veldt around Johannesburg, symbols of apartheid's political economy, and the digs of zama-zamas, freelance miners who scratch out overlooked crumbs of gold. Whose land is this, he seems to ask, and who determines its history?
All this is done with only charcoal and a smudging cloth, a sequence of minutely different drawings on one palimpsestic sheet of paper that, once filmed, have the immediacy of early animation. With editing by Walter Murch, an American who worked on ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", the effect is layered and theatrical. Mr Kentridge adds performance: improvised music by Kyle Shepherd, a pianist and composer from Cape Town, in which the piano strings are blocked with bits of wood or bound in foil paper to create sounds that echo the axe and the bulldozer. Then he introduces a Zulu chorale by Nhlanhla Mahlangu, a long-time collaborator, about being forced off the land. For Mr Kentridge, sound can convey memory, and the essence of South Africa's landscape, as much as visual imagery.
In 2022 he will emulate Ai Weiwei and Anselm Kiefer and take over the Royal Academy in London for a retrospective of his career. He hopes all his new films, collectively to be called ""Studio Life"", will be shown together. Even now, though, he sees himself as merely the initiator of his art. His collaborators turn it into something new and, with their own memories and connections, so do his audience. *"

Economic research can reverberate beyond the ivory tower. In 2003 a study of Kenyan schools found that treating intestinal worms improved attendance. After similar work confirmed the policy's benefits, one author, Michael Kremer, founded an ngo that treats 280m children a year.
Mr Kremer's work was unusually impactful, but reflects a pattern of research improving policy. One study found that telling Brazilian mayors about the gains from sending reminder letters to taxpayers sharply increased their chances of doing so. Yet many similar countries attract far fewer studies. This can leave policymakers fumbling in the dark (see Free exchange).
To measure this problem, we turned to EconLit, a database curated by the American Economic Association with 910,000 journal articles from 1990-2019. It only tracks papers with abstracts in English, the field's lingua franca, causing it to underrepresent studies intended for non-Anglophone audiences. However, EconLit does include 110,000 papers in other languages with abstracts translated into English.
By far, the best predictor of the amount of research conducted on a country was its gdp. However, economic size leaves many cases unexplained. Kenya gets three times more articles than its gdp suggests; Algeria has one-quarter as many as expected.
Such outliers often cluster in research ""oases"" or ""deserts"". Obie Porteous of Middlebury College notes that studies of Africa are disproportionately concentrated in the continent's south and east. Expanding this analysis worldwide, we find that the Middle East and parts of Latin America get relatively few papers with English abstracts. China and Russia also seem under-studied.
In contrast, South Asia and some regions in eastern Europe were oases. Like much of southern and eastern Africa, India and Pakistan were colonised by Britain. Today, many authors of articles about them work in Britain or America. Meanwhile, European research gluts seem locally driven. Lots of studies on Slovenia, which has one of EconLit's highest papers-to-GDP ratios, stem from universities in Maribor and Ljubljana that churn out articles in English.
To adjust for such factors, we built a statistical model to predict a country's share of studies in each year. gdp remained the most important variable, though it mattered less in oil-rich states. The next-best predictors of popularity in the Anglophone database were listing English as an official language and sending lots of students to American universities (boosting places like China). Variables that capture data availability, such as the number of World Development Indicators a country publishes, also had meaningful effects.
These factors improved the model a lot. They explained most of the difference between Kenya and Algeria, for example. After incorporating them, we found that a country's spending on universities, form of government and involvement in armed conflicts did not yield additional accuracy.
For policymakers in research deserts who want academic support, that is good news. In the short term, they can do little to boost national gdp significantly. But being more forthcoming with data and fostering links with Western scholars should help. *"

General Charles (Chuck) Yeager, test pilot and the first to break the sound barrier, died on December 7th, aged 97
If a flock of grouse flew across his path when he was out hunting, Chuck Yeager knew what would happen. He would get his slingshot, pick up some stones, and let fly. With his 20/10 vision in both eyes, he could see to infinity; in five minutes two or three grouse would be dead, hit square in the head. When challenged to target-shoot at a paper plate nailed to a tree, he could aim to hit the nail. He had practised those skills in the woods of West Virginia until they were second nature.
In the second world war, flying over France in P-5is, he once more saw his prey from a long way off and stayed up-sun, so the Germans wouldn't spot him. Then he shifted to be down-sun, behind them. Once he picked off five Me109s in a day, getting into a big old hairy dogfight, buzzing, diving, shooting, lots of high-gs, becoming an ace right there. He knew how his plane should behave, how all the hardware worked, how the ejector seat and parachute would save him: knew it as a mechanic, which was his training. Armed with that knowledge, nothing much could surprise him. He was in firm control of what was right around him, and what he couldn't control, such as the enemy, or the outcome, or death, was not worth worrying about. He was too busy.
But when on October 14th 1947 he was dropped in the Bell X-i, a rocket-powered experimental plane, from the bomb bay of a B-29, he had no idea what lay ahead. Fun, probably, as he loved the X-i, and in his post-war test-pilot job he preferred tactical flying that focused on one aircraft, rather than a dozen different planes every week. It was more like combat, and the band of pilots he now belonged to, at Muroc air force base in California, were ex-warriors who felt the same way. ""Glamorous Glennis"" was painted on the bright orange fuselage in tribute to his wife-the wife with whom he'd had a horseback race two nights before, busting a couple of ribs when his horse flipped him, which still hurt like hell.
The engineers back at base feared that breaching the sound barrier might rip the aircraft apart. The least he expected was something like a bump in the road, to show he'd done it: strong proof for the friendly rivals back at base. Instead, at around 700mph (i,i26kph) he felt nothing particular, just a bit of resistance, like poking his finger through Jell-O. He got the Collier trophy for it, a nice statuette on a plinth, and the family went to the White House to collect it (his father, a staunch Republican, refused to shake Harry Truman's hand). But it was quite a let-down.
He had to go much faster to get the effects he had been halfanticipating. That happened in December 1953, after a few flights approaching Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. He was warned that if he went any faster his X-iA aircraft might ""go divergent"". It did. At 74,700 feet (22,800 metres), and at 2.44 Mach speed, it began to roll uncontrollably, then spin upside down. Completely disoriented, battered by plus and minus g-loads, he remembered his helmet cracking the inner canopy, and not a lot else. At last the plane got upright and, at 25,000 feet, he popped it out of the spin. He had dropped 50,000 feet in 70 seconds. Back in radio contact, he gasped out: ""Christ!...Boy, I'm not doing that any more.""
It was odd enough that he was in the air anyway. As a boy, running the hills or sitting with his grandfather learning to fish, he never got near a plane, except to see one in the sky. He had no ambitions that way and, with only high school behind him, not enough education. He enlisted in the air force in 1941 as a mechanic, earthbound and easy, because he had already tinkered for years with engines, water-pumps and his father's cable tools for drilling for natural gas. He took up flight training mostly because pilots had beautiful girls on their arms, and hands that weren't dirty. But he became the most decorated pilot in America.
In the same strange sort of reversal, he started out with no interest in space and ended up training astronauts. In the 1950s, when space was mentioned, he would dismiss it as a place where he wouldn't be flying, but sitting in a thing controlled by someone else. No doubt the views were pretty, but he couldn't have cared less. And anyway, he had no degree. His ideas changed as the government began to press the space programme and America, in his view, fell far behind the Soviets in developing space technology. The USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Muroc, now Edwards air force base, which he ran from 1962, offered a state-of-the-art simulator that covered every stage of a space flight, from take-off to landing. Applicants swarmed in, and a bare 1% made it, since even fine grades on paper cut little ice with him. Astronauts, like pilots, had to know the machinery they were riding in, how to fix it and how to get back safely, not rely on some bunch of engineers. Like him, they basically had to be mechanics.
Over the years he became well-known, but it was an intermittent sort of fame. After the war he was celebrated as West Virginia's leading ace. After breaking Mach in 1947, hardly a month passed without some magazine running an article about him. In the 1960s, when he was running the research-pilot school, he once did 163 talks in a year. He was a draw at any air show and at the Indy 500, where several times he opened proceedings in the pace car, gunning it with joy. Still, people didn't match the name to the face, he thought, until he did the AcDelco car-parts commercial on tv; and then when, in 1983, his Mach exploits appeared on cinema screens in ""The Right Stuff"", the film of Tom Wolfe's book about the band of pilots. He had helped on the book, going through crash reports, which Wolfe kept getting wrong. As for the film, it was just entertainment, pretty much fiction, from Sam Shepard's dark handsome face to all those blue skies outside the windows.
So when he was asked, as he was annoyingly often, whether he had the ""right stuff"", as a test pilot and generally, he gave a downto-earth answer. Rather than being ""the most righteous"", with ""the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning moment"", as Wolfe wrote, he just knew all about his planes, and had worked his tail off learning it. A mechanic's answer which, as ever, hit the nail on the head. *"

Covid-19 has so far caused over 73m recorded infections and more than 1.6m recorded deaths. On January 23rd the Chinese authorities imposed a quarantine in Wuhan, soon extending it to the rest of Hubei province and beyond. Variants of this ""lockdown"" policy were adopted by other countries as they struggled to contain the outbreak.
Every breath you take
By late January cases were widely reported in Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. Markets were rattled, fearing disruption to global supply chains that run through China. By late February the World Health Organisation said that most infections were occurring outside China. Italy was the first country to be hit hard. After hospitals were overwhelmed, the country went into lockdown in early March.
The sudden imposition of lockdowns led to panic buying in some places, notably in America and Britain, where supermarket shelves were stripped bare. Shopping moved online. Internet searches rocketed for goods such as toilet paper, fitness equipment and breadmakers. In poorer countries, such as India, the human cost was higher. Left suddenly without work, many migrant labourers tried to return to their family homes; it was the country's greatest movement of people since partition in 1947. India's economy shrank by around 25% in April-June.
By late March China was recording fewer domestic cases. The lockdown in Wuhan ended in early April. China closed its border to foreigners as the disease spread rapidly in Europe, most menacingly in Britain, France, Italy and Spain.
Don't stand so close to me
America was hit almost as hard by the coronavirus. Donald Trump didn't take it seriously at first; he tried to lift federal restrictions in April, promising a return to normality by Easter. Wearing a face mask became a badge of political allegiance. Mr Trump rowed with the who, accusing it of being in China's pocket, and said that America would leave it in 2021. Brazil was also led by a sceptic. Jair Bolsonaro said the disease was just a case of the ""sniffles"".
The extent of the market crash in mid-March (the s&p 500 lost a quarter of its value over three weeks) sparked fears of a depression. The Federal Reserve and other central banks made emergency cuts to interest rates. The Fed also propped up the corporate-bond market, action it had shied away from during the financial crisis a decade earlier.
Oil markets took a hammering. As if the pandemic were not enough of a problem, in March Saudi Arabia instigated a price war with Russia, as their deal over production levels broke down. Prices plunged in the steepest one-day decline since 1991. They eventually recovered somewhat. By the end of the year opec and Russia had struck a tentative agreement to increase supply.
Politicians in many countries pulled out their fiscal bazookas to defend their economies. America's Congress passed a $2.2trn stimulus bill (the cares act), which directed cash payments to households and topped up unemployment benefits. Some 21m people lost their jobs in April alone; unemployment soared to 14.7%, but it never hit the 20% that some had forecast. Britain guaranteed 80% of wages to workers who had been furloughed, and even subsidised restaurant meals in August.
Spirits in the material world
The pandemic was a boon for some. Once the shock of lockdowns faded, stockmarkets climbed towards new records, in part because of the soaring share prices of tech firms. Zoom meetings became a feature for office employees sent home to work remotely (Zoom fatigue was soon a common gripe). As online shopping flourished, Amazon recruited hundreds of thousands of extra staff. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's boss, saw his wealth increase from $111bn in March to $185bn in December. The combined wealth of the world's ten richest people grew by 57%, to $1.14trn.
Among industries, aviation and tourism were the biggest losers from the pandemic. Even with huge government bail-outs, airlines are reckoned to have lost $51obn in revenue, according to their international association. The un reported that international tourism declined by 70% in JanuaryAugust, causing a loss of $730bn in export revenues.
Scientists had what many thought to be a Herculean task developing a vaccine for covid-19, but drug firms made great strides and by the end of the year several jabs were ready. Britain started the first inoculation programme using a fully tested vaccine, followed soon after by America. Even with the vaccine, officials warn, the world will be battling the virus for another year.
The outbreak of civil war in Ethiopia was one of 2020's great disappointments. Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister and winner of a Nobel peace prize, launched an attack on the Tigray region when separatist forces attacked the army.
Chinese and Indian troops clashed along their Himalayan border, the first deadly encounter between the two sides in decades. Fighting also erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the longdisputed enclave of NagornoKarabakh. Their truce is shaky.
Abe Shinzo, Japan's longestserving prime minister, stood down from office because of ill health. He was replaced by Suga Yoshihide, who is determined that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead in July 2021.
China imposed a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong to crush anti-government unrest. It came into force just before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule. Elections to the Legislative Council were postponed; pro-democracy candidates had been expected to do well. Opposition legislators resigned en masse in protest against the disbarring of colleagues.
De do do do, de da da da
America's presidential election was a rowdy affair. The Democratic primaries produced a surprise when Pete Buttigieg was declared the winner in Iowa; a delay in the count because of a technical glitch raised more questions about America's election machinery. Joe Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday, and went on to win the presidency. Donald Trump, who was acquitted at his impeachment trial in February, resorted to more shenanigans, falsely claiming the result was fraudulent. He will be gone from the White House on January 20th 2021.
The death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of police in Minneapolis sparked the worst unrest across America for decades. Floyd's cry that he couldn't breathe to the officer kneeling on his neck reverberated around the world. The incident led to a surge in global support for Black Lives Matter and a reckoning with the legacy of slavery and colonialism. Toppling statues of white men was de rigueur for woke activists in many cities. America endured a summer of protest; notable flashpoints included Kenosha and Portland.
So lonely
Britain officially left the European Union on January 31st, entering a transition period that ends on December 31st. Talks about a trade deal dragged on. Whatever the outcome, Britons were told to expect delays when visiting the continent from now on.
Venezuelan troops intercepted two small boatloads of men who wanted to overthrow the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. ""Operation Gideon"" was led by two former members of America's special forces. Six of the invaders, a group of deserters and Maduro opponents, were executed.
Western intelligence fingered the Kremlin for trying to assassinate Alexei Navalny, Russia's main opposition leader. Poisoned by novichok, a nerve agent, Mr Navalny fell ill on a plane and was airlifted to Germany for treatment. He eventually recovered and later called on the eu to impose sanctions on high-ranking Russian oligarchs.
King of pain
Belarus was thrown into crisis when Alexander Lukashenko won a sixth term as president in another rigged election. Widespread protests were brutally suppressed by state goons, forcing opposition leaders to flee the country.
Israel's third election in less than a year led to a powersharing agreement, with Binyamin Netanyahu remaining as prime minister until November 2021. Israel also signed peace deals, brokered by the Trump administration, with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Other Arab countries may follow.

There was talk of war in the Gulf region after America assassinated Qassem Suleimani, Iran's foremost general, in a drone strike at Baghdad's airport in January. Five days later a Ukrainian airliner crashed after taking off from Tehran airport, killing all 176 people on board. Iran's armed forces later admitted that they had mistaken the plane for a missile and shot it down.
Parts of central Beirut were destroyed by a huge explosion, killing 200 people and injuring 6,500. A fire at the port ignited 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored and neglected for seven years. The blast, felt 240km away in Cyprus, led to the resignation of the Lebanese government.

""Parasite"", a South Korean comedy thriller, was the surprise winner at the Oscars. It beat the bookies' favourite, ""1917"", to scoop best picture, the first foreign-language film to do so.
Synchronicity
The film industry was hit hard by lockdowns, as cinema closures postponed the release of many blockbusters until 2021. Some went straight to streaming. Disney+, the studio's streaming service, ended the year with 87m subscribers. It wasn't expecting to reach that number until 2024; it now thinks it may have 260m users in four years' time. Disney reorganised its content delivery around streaming.

Warren harding built a campaign for the presidential election in 1920 around his new word ""normalcy"". It was an appeal to Americans' supposed urge to forget the horrors of the first world war and the Spanish flu and turn back to the certainties of the Golden Age. And yet, instead of embracing Harding's normalcy, the Roaring Twenties became a ferment of forwardlooking, risk-taking social, industrial and artistic novelty.
War had something to do with the Jazz Age's lack of inhibition. So did the flu pandemic, which killed six times as many Americans and left survivors with an appetite to live the 1920s at speed. That spirit will also animate the 2020s. The sheer scale of the suffering from covid-19, the injustices and dangers the pandemic has revealed, and the promise of innovation mean that it will be remembered as the year when everything changed.
The pandemic has been a once-in-a-century event (see Graphic detail). sars-cov-2 has been found in over 70m people and possibly infected another 500m or more who were never diagnosed. It has caused 1.6m recorded deaths; many hundreds of thousands have gone unrecorded. Millions of survivors are living with the exhaustion and infirmities of ""long covid"". World economic output is at least 7% lower than it would otherwise have been, the biggest slump since the second world war. Out of the ashes of all that suffering will emerge the sense that life is not to be hoarded, but lived.
Another reason to expect change-or, at least, to wish for it-is that covid-19 has served as a warning. The 80bn animals slaughtered for food and fur each year are Petri dishes for the viruses and bacteria that evolve into a lethal human pathogen every decade or so. This year the bill came due and it was astronomical. The clear blue skies that appeared as the economy went into lockdown were a powerful symbol of how covid-19 is a fastmoving crisis within a slow-moving one that it in some ways resembles. Like the pandemic, climate change is impervious to populist denials, global in the disruption it causes and will be far more costly to deal with in the future if it is neglected now.
And a third reason to expect change is that the pandemic has highlighted injustice. Children have fallen behind in their lessons-and too often gone hungry. School leavers and graduates have once again seen their prospects recede. People of all ages have endured loneliness or violence at home. Migrant workers have been cast adrift, or sent back to their villages, taking the disease with them. The suffering has been skewed by race. A 40year-old Hispanic-American is 12 times more likely to die from covid-19 than a white American of the same age. In S&acaron;o Paulo black Brazilians under 20 are twice as likely to die as whites.
As the world has adapted some of these iniquities have got worse. Studies suggest that about 60% of jobs in America paying over $100,000 can be done from home, compared with 10% of jobs paying under $40,000. As unemployment has soared this year, the msci index of world stockmarkets has risen by 11%. In the worst case, the un reckons, the pandemic could force over 200m people into extreme poverty. Their plight will be exacerbated by authoritarians and would-be tyrants who have exploited the virus to tighten their stranglehold on power.
Perhaps that is why pandemics have led to social upheaval in the past. The imf looked at 133 countries in 2001-18 and found that unrest surged about 14 months after the onset of disease, peaking after 24 months. The more unequal a society, the more upheaval. Indeed, the fund warns of a vicious circle in which protest further increases hardship which, in turn, feeds protest.
Fortunately, covid-19 has not just brought about the need for change, it also points a way forward. That is partly because it has served as an engine of innovation. Under lockdown, e-commerce as a share of American retail sales increased as much in eight weeks as it had in the previous five years. As people worked from home, travel on the New York subway fell by over 90%. Almost overnight, businesses like this newspaper began to be run from spare rooms and kitchen tables-an experiment that would otherwise have taken years to unfold, if ever.
This disruption is in its infancy. The pandemic is proof that change is possible even in conservative industries like health care. Fuelled by cheap capital and new technology, including artificial intelligence and, possibly, quantum computing (see Finance section), innovation will burn through industry after industry. For example, costs at American colleges and universities have increased almost five times faster than consumer prices in the past 40 years, even as teaching has barely changed, making it tempting to disrupters. Further technological progress in renewable sources of energy, smart grids and battery storage are all vital steps on the path to replacing fossil fuels.
The coronavirus has also revealed something profound about the way societies should treat knowledge. Consider how Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of sars-cov-2 within weeks and shared it with the world. The new vaccines that resulted are just one stop in the light-speed progress that has elucidated where the virus came from, whom it affects, how it kills, and what might treat it.
It is a remarkable demonstration of what science can achieve. At a time when conspiracies run wild, this research stands as a rebuke to the know-nothings and zealots in dictatorships and democracies who behave as if the evidence for a claim is as nothing next to the identity of the person asserting it.
And the pandemic has led to a burst of innovative government. Those which can afford it-and some, like Brazil's, that cannot (see Americas section)-have suppressed inequality by spending over $10trn on covid-19, three times more in real terms than in the financial crisis. That will dramatically reset citizen's expectations about what governments can do for them.
Many people under lockdown have asked themselves what matters most in life. Governments should take that as their inspiration, focusing on policies that promote individual dignity, self-reliance and civic pride. They should recast welfare and education and take on concentrations of entrenched power so as to open up new thresholds for their citizens. Something good can come from the misery of the plague year. It should include a new social contract fit for the 21st century. *"

Trustbusters say they are going after the tech giants. Markets don't take them seriously
Five years ago antitrust was a backwater. In America complacent trustbusters had failed to spot the rise of big tech firms. In the European Union they noticed it, but didn't do much. But the competition cops have at last sprung. On December 15th the eu unveiled two draft digital-services laws that would create a sweeping supervisory apparatus to control Silicon Valley. In America the federal government has just launched antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. These moves mark the biggest shift in competition policy in a generation, so you might expect investors to be worried that big tech firms are under serious threat. Instead, their reaction has been Olympian indifference. The market value of the five biggest Silicon Valley firms has risen by 46% in 2020, to reach $7.2trn. Antitrust's credibility deficit reflects a lack of transatlantic unity and the flaws of two very different strategies.
In America the chances of new laws being passed are low because of a gridlocked Congress and because some politicians think that having dominant American tech firms is a strategic advantage in the contest with China. Instead, trustbusters have to demonstrate in court that the tech firms have broken existing laws. The case against Google is more likely to succeed-it focuses on a web of $10bn or more in annual payments made by Google to Apple and manufacturing firms to ensure that its services got prominence on device screens. The case against Facebook argues that it illegally acquired WhatsApp and Instagram to kill off competition; this is more of a stretch, because both were small firms at the time. Do not expect any decisions soon. Microsoft's antitrust case began in 1998 and took six years to resolve. Recently the courts have been sceptical of big antitrust suits, including those against American Express and at&t Time Warner.
If America's strategy is narrow and backward-looking, the eu's is broad and forward-looking. It tends to put more faith in regulation-and does not have any home-grown tech giants to worry about. Big tech firms will be designated as systemically important, and in some cases as ""gatekeepers"" too, and face obligations over data, content and the treatment of other firms which use their platforms. The danger is that an ill-defined and sprawling regime muffles dynamism and entrenches incumbents. Yet even if the eu eventually passes new laws, it may have problems enforcing them. The five biggest tech firms make 25% of their sales in Europe, versus 51% in America, and may prefer to run their European arms under local rules, rather than adopt eu policy globally. The maximum fine the eu is contemplating is just 1% of big tech's market value. It is hard to imagine how the eu could break up an American company on its own.
On paper it is possible to pick the best of both approaches. The goal should be to catalyse competition, rather than accept monopolies and mitigate their cost through regulation. Prising open closed markets should be the priority: America's trustbusters are right to focus on the ways in which Google and others have locked out competitors. Taking a sceptical line on future acquisitions by big tech firms is essential, too. America should copy the eu's effort to give individuals power over their data, which could also help unlock competition. Last, both sides should agree that policing content-for example, fake news-is a matter for media policy, not trustbusters.
Yet transatlantic agreement is far off. And, complicating things further, parts of the industry are getting more competitive even amid the howls to tame ""big tech"". Trustbusters should worry about products where market shares are high, profits are suspiciously plump and new entrants are thin on the ground. Search and online advertising fit this description, but large areas of tech look increasingly contested, including streaming, e-commerce and the cloud-and often the competition is coming from other big tech firms. They, not the transatlantic trustbusters, are more likely to change the weather. *"

Girls are doing better than ever. Don't let the pandemic stymie them
For much of human history and in many places, girls were considered property. Or, at best, subordinate people, required to obey their fathers until the day they had to start obeying their husbands. Few people thought it worthwhile to educate them. Even fewer imagined that a girl could grow up to govern Germany, run the imf or invent a vaccine.
In most of the world that vision of girlhood now seems not merely old-fashioned but unimaginably remote. In much of the rich world parents now treat their daughters as well as they do their sons, and invest as much in their future (see Essay). In field after field girls have caught up with boys. Globally, young women now outnumber young men at university. The speed of change has been blistering. Fifty years ago only 49% of primaryschool-age girls in lower-middle-income countries were in school, compared with 71% of boys; today the share of both is about 90%. In 1998 only half the world's secondary-school-age girls were enrolled; today two-thirds are. Over the same period rates of illiteracy fell from one in five young women aged 15-24 to one in ten, bringing them roughly on a par with young men.
Girl babies are more wanted than ever before. Parents in some countries prefer them. Even in places, such as China, where the sex-selective abortion of girl fetuses has been rife, it is often be- coming less so. Girls are also less likely to be married off in childhood. In 1995 almost six in ten girls in South Asia were hitched before reaching 18; that ratio has fallen by half. Around the world, it has fallen from one in four to one in five.
Girls are healthier, too. Compared with the mid-1990s, they become sexually active later and are more likely to use contraception. Rates of teenage pregnancy have fallen by a quarter globally and by two-thirds in South Asia and North America. Girls are less likely to suffer female genital mutilation-and object to this horrific tradition more vocally. Whereas in 2000 just 27% of women and girls in the most-affected regions said it should be banned, today 54% do.
When societies handle girlhood well, the knock-on effects are astounding. A girl who finishes secondary school is less likely to become a child bride or a teenage mother. Education boosts earning power and widens choices, so she is less likely to be poor or to suffer domestic abuse. She will earn almost twice as much as a girl without schooling.
And she will pass on a smorgasbord of advantages to her offspring. She will have fewer children, and invest more in them. They will be less likely to die in infancy, or to grow up stunted physically or mentally. She will read to them more, and help them with their homework. All this means they will learn more, and earn more as adults. A recent study by Citigroup and Plan International estimated that, if a group of emerging economies ensured that 100% of their girls completed secondary school, it could lead to a lasting boost to their gdp of 10% by 2030.
Because the benefits of nurturing girls are so large, it is a scandal that some countries have still failed to grasp them. Less than half the girls in South Asia, the Middle East or Africa have access to the contraception that they may want. Only one girl in three south of the Sahara finishes her secondary education. And although rates of child marriage have fallen by half in South Asia, they have fallen by less than that in Africa (which now has the highest rate in the world) and have remained stagnant in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The covid-19 pandemic could hobble progress for girls in poor countries, or even reverse it. During previous disasters, they have often suffered most. When Ebola forced west African schools to close in 2014, many girls dropped out, never went back and ended up pregnant or as child labourers. unicef warns that something similar could happen with covid-19-but on a larger scale. Studies suggest that in the next decade 13m child marriages that would have been averted may go ahead, and an extra 2m girls may have their genitals cut.
The risk of regression is real. So it is crucial that, even if governments of poor countries have to tighten their belts, they prioritise spending on education and girls. Donors should help, too. And policies should be joined up. Persuading girls to stay in school longer is not only a way to teach them maths; it is also a chance to vaccinate them and teach them about birth control, consent and self-assertion. It can even be an opportunity to advise parents about the downsides of child marriage.
Adolescence is a crucial juncture for girls. It is when many health problems emerge or are averted; and many social ones, too, from truancy to self-harm. Only recently has this phase been recognised as the most important for brain development after infancy. Get it right and billions of girls will have a better shot at fulfilling their potential. Get it wrong and they will live poorer, shorter lives, less able to stand up for themselves, more vulnerable to coercion, and more likely to pass these disadvantages on to the next generation. So, get girlhood right. *"

Why democracy doesn't yet spread in the Middle East and north Africa
hat kind of repression do you imagine it takes for a W young man to do this?"" So asked Leila Bouazizi after her brother, Muhammad, set himself on fire ten years ago. Local officials in Tunisia had confiscated his fruit cart, ostensibly because he did not have a permit but really because they wanted to extort money from him. It was the final indignity for the young man. ""How do you expect me to make a living?"" he shouted before dousing himself with petrol in front of the governor's office.
His actions would resonate across the region, where millions of others had reached breaking-point, too. Their rage against oppressive leaders and corrupt states came bursting forth as the Arab spring. Uprisings toppled the dictators of four countries- Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. For a moment it seemed as if democracy had arrived in the Arab world at last.
A decade later, though, no celebrations are planned (see Middle East & Africa section). Only one of those democratic experiments yielded a durable result-fittingly, in Bouazizi's Tunisia. Egypt's failed miserably, ending in a military coup. Libya, Yemen and, worst of all, Syria descended into bloody civil wars that drew in foreign powers. The Arab spring turned to bitter winter so quickly that many people now despair of the region.
Much has changed there since, but not for the better. The Arab world's despots are far from secure. With oil prices low, even petro-potentates can no longer afford to buy their subjects off with fat subsidies and cushy government jobs. Many leaders have grown more paranoid and oppressive. Muhammad bin Salman of Saudi Arabia locks up his own relatives. Egypt's AbdelFattah al-Sisi has stifled the press and crushed civil society. One lesson autocrats learned from the Arab spring is that any flicker of dissent must be snuffed out fast, lest it spread.
The region is less free than it was in 2010-and perhaps more angry. It has been shaken by wars, jihad, refugees and covid-19. Activists contend that Arabs are no longer willing to put up with the same old misery, and say they are more confident that they can bring about change. The Arab spring's flame never completely went out, says one. No fancy name was given to the swathe of protests that engulfed Arab countries in 2019, yet they pushed out as many leaders as those of the Arab spring.
Unfortunately, the states that were jolted in 2019-Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon and Sudan-are faring only a little better than those convulsed by the Arab spring. Could it be true, as some argue, that Arabs simply cannot abide democracy? Some lament that the region's generals are too politically entrenched to allow a real opening. Others say that austere local strains of Islam are incompatible with pluralism. Is Tunisia, blessed with pragmatic Islamists and generals who have apparently learned to obey elected politicians, the exception that proves the rule?
It is too early to say. The seeds of modern democracy have yet to be properly sown in the Arab world. The thirst among Arab citizens to choose their own rulers is as strong as it is elsewhere. What they need most is for independent institutions-universities, the media, civic groups, above all the courts and the mosques-to evolve without being in thrall to government. Only then can space be found for an engaged and informed citizenry. Only then are people likely to accept that political disputes can be resolved peacefully.
It would help if Arabs had more freedom to debate. Schools in the region tend to emphasise rote learning over critical thinking. The media and the mosques tend to parrot the government line. Autocrats seek to co-opt social media, too. All this breeds distrust in information itself. Conspiracy theories abound. Arabs tend to mistrust not only their governments but also each other, thanks in part to a system that requires bribes and wasta, or connections, to accomplish even the most mundane tasks. Corruption undermines confidence in the state. Few expect it to provide for the common good. Despots encourage people to think of politics in zero-sum terms: if another group wins power, they will grab all the money and public jobs. Opponents are portrayed as extremists who wish their fellow countrymen dead.
In such parched soil, it is unsurprising that democracy failed to take root. But there are ways, in the long run, to fertilise it. Promoting education is vital. Democracies should welcome more Arab students. They should also speak up for Arab journalists, human-rights campaigners and ngos. A culture of pluralism takes time to grow. But the status quo is unstable and unsustainable, as a frustrated fruit-seller tragically demonstrated. *"

The Economist's annual award for most-improved country
In most years most countries improve in various ways. In 2020, however, premature death and economic contraction became the new normal, and most countries aspired only to dodge the worst of it. Inevitably, our shortlist of most-improved countries includes some that merely avoided regressing much.
Few people would argue that life in New Zealand was better in 2020 than in 2019. But the virus has been contained. When only 100 cases had been detected, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, closed the borders, locked down the country and urged its ""team of 5m"" (ie, the whole population) to be kind to each other. Only 25 Kiwis have died and life has more or less returned to normal. Rugby stadiums finished the season packed with fans. The amiable Ms Ardern was re-elected with a majority in a country where such things are almost unheard of.
Taiwan has done even better, with only seven deaths and a far stronger economic performance. Leave aside whether Taiwan is a country or merely a contender for ""de facto self-governing territory of the year"". It kept the virus at bay without closing schools, shops or restaurants, much less imposing lockdowns. Its economy is one of the few expected to have grown in 2020. It also showed courage, refusing to back down despite relentless threats from Beijing. China's government often says that Taiwan must be reunited with the mainland. It has been sending warships and fighter jets ever closer to the island, ever more often. Yet in January Taiwanese voters spurned a presidential candidate who favoured warmer ties with China and re-elected Tsai Ing-wen, whose government has been sheltering democracy activists from Hong Kong. Taiwan is a constant reminder that Chinese culture is perfectly compatible with liberal democracy.
These achievements are impressive. However, the pandemic is not yet over and to judge a country on its covid-fighting record is to focus on specific forms of good governance when circumstances of geography and genes make comparisons hard. Being an island helps. Some populations may have immunity to coronaviruses. So it is worth considering other candidates.
The United States did almost as badly as Britain, Italy and Spain in its response to covid-19, but its Operation Warp Speed was central to bringing about a vaccine in record time. And by rejecting President Donald Trump in November, American voters did their bit to curb the spread of populism-another global scourge. Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the will of those voters were unprecedented for a sitting president, but the judges he appointed were loyal to the law, not the man who picked them.
Voters in Bolivia, too, restored a measure of normality. After a fraud-tainted election, the overthrow of a socialist president, violent protests and the vengeful, incompetent rule of an interim president, the Andean nation held a peaceful re-run ballot in October and picked a technocrat, Luis Arce.
But this year's prize goes to a country in southern Africa. Democracy and respect for human rights regressed in 80 countries between the start of the pandemic and September, reckons Freedom House, a think-tank. The only place where they improved was Malawi.
To appreciate its progress, consider what came before. In 2012 a president died, his death was covered up and his corpse flown to South Africa for ""medical treatment"", to buy time so that his brother could take over. That brother, Peter Mutharika, failed to grab power then but was elected two years later and ran for reelection. The vote-count was rigged with correction fluid on the tally sheets. Foreign observers cynically approved it anyway. Malawians launched mass protests against the ""Tipp-Ex election"". Malawian judges turned down suitcases of bribes and annulled it. A fair re-run in June booted out Mr Mutharika and installed the people's choice, Lazarus Chakwera. Malawi is still poor, but its people are citizens, not subjects. For reviving democracy in an authoritarian region, it is our country of the year. *"

Your leader on British farming and food standards after Brexit underplayed the role of international agritrade policy (""Ploughing its own furrow"", November 28th). Take your example of free-range eggs. British consumers can buy them in confidence now because of high eu and British standards. A tariff on eggs and egg products protects the market from imports that are marked as free range but are of a lower standard. In America, for example, an egg can be marketed as free-range as long as the hen house has one pophole; there is no definition as to what counts for a ""range"" or outside area for the hens, drastically reducing the cost. A British hen house will have, say, 20 popholes depending on the size of a flock. Without a tariff, lower-priced American imports would bankrupt British free-range egg farmers.
Your supposition that British consumers would prefer to buy the more expensive British free-range eggs over cheap imported ones has already been disproved in the example of pig meat. In the 1990s Britain banned sow stalls ahead of the rest of the eu, adding considerable cost to the production of domestic pig meat products. The government thought consumers would favour more expensive, higher welfare British pork, but instead they turned to cheaper pork from Denmark and the Netherlands. Half the British pig industry was exported overnight, a loss to the economy, and pig welfare.

Life in the old dogfight yet
A dogfight in aerial combat is known as ""basic fighter manoeuvring"", or bfm, within the profession (""Virtual mavericks"", November 21st). Guns are no longer used, but a missile shot within visual range after the point at which two fighters pass each other and the manoeuvring that follows is in fact a dogfight.
Throughout the history of combat aviation many have said that the dogfight is dead, and have been proved wrong. In Vietnam it was because the missiles were unreliable. In the future it may be stealth, electronic warfare, or strict rules of engagement that prevent a shot beyond visual range against a target. America's shooting down of a Syrian su-22 in 2017 may not be a true dogfight to some, but it was conducted within visual range with extensive manoeuvring. The pilot, a graduate of the us navy's topgun, employed his bfm skills that day.
You also noted that an autonomous aircraft cannot explain what it did and why. The role of briefing and debriefing in combat aviation cannot be understated, and until this gap is addressed it limits what we can expect from robot wingmen.

Very clever to take Christopher Wren's epitaph and repurpose it for the Arecibo radio telescope (""Si monumentum requiris respicite"", November 28th), inviting us to look back, respicere, rather than around, circumspicere. And very astute to modify the imperative to address a presumed plurality of readers (respicite) instead of the original's solitary visitor to St Paul's (circumspice).
But perplexing that you failed to address the other verb (requiris) to all your readers as well (requiritis). The Economist's wordplay department risks being seen as too clever by exactly half.

If you want my advice
Bagehot's search of a modern Machiavelli for Boris Johnson is timely (November 21st). Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" advises a leader how to act. Machiavelli, who suffered two turns on the rack for his guidance, compares Fortune to a violent river that causes havoc when enraged. When the river is quiet, a leader needs to protect himself by building embankments, dykes and canals. A leader who does not take these precautions is at the mercy of Fortune, but if he prepares and adapts, he prospers. Mr Johnson did not prepare for the pandemic, has not built defences against the potential havoc of Brexit, and the protections against climate change are as yet just words.

Sitting in South Asia I feel obliged to point out that Kautilya, the Indian Machiavelli, wrote ""Arthashastra"", his science of politics, around 1,800 years before ""The Prince"". As Roger Boesche noted in the preface to ""The First Great Political Realist"", Kautilya makes Machiavelli seem mild. For example, whereas Machiavelli only cursorily examines the topic of assassination and gives no advice about spies, arrest on suspicion, and torture, Kautilya discusses all these issues at length.

Employ more conservatives
America's State Department has an obvious diversity problem by employing too many white males (""Altered state"", November 21st). But the not so obvious problem is a lack of diverse political opinion. One would be hard-pressed to find any significant percentage of Republicans in its ranks, let alone a number like 48%, which more accurately represents the politics of America. This blind spot has left the department vulnerable to changing administrations and ineffective in implementing policy that is often at odds with its staff's core beliefs.

Talking turkey
There is a very intriguing bit of etymological happenstance for the word ""turkey"" (World in a dish, 1843, November 18th). In Arabic, a turkey, deek rumi, is the literal translation of ""roman chicken"". The turkey made its way into the Arab lexicon and kitchens long after the Roman Empire had met its end. What the literal translation misses is that ""Roman"" throughout various Arab and Muslim empires had generally become a lexical stand in for Christian, the implication being that a turkey is a chicken from some Christian parts of the world.

On Christmas day in 1948, Marie Harris published the mid-century equivalent of a status update. In June that year, ""lying on the beach watching the waves of the Pacific roll in"", she and her husband Bob had decided they needed more space for their young family. Through an ad in the local paper they found just the place: a rambling old farmhouse with green shutters in rural Shedd, Oregon. They swapped their crowded city digs for a retreat worthy of Instagram: five acres of land, thick with boysenberries, apple, pear and walnut trees. But apart from the 17 chickens, three geese, two cats, a cow, a duck and a collie called Mac, Shedd was not a sociable sort of place. So Marie's three-page bulletin ended with something akin to a friend request: ""We have lots of animals,"" typed the 28-year-old, ""but would like company of a more human sort-and mail.""
So concluded the first edition of the Harris Herald, a newsletter which Marie would publish every Christmas for the rest of her life. Usually typed on a side or two of letter paper and sometimes embellished with stick-man drawings, maps and photos, the Herald provided friends and family with news of high-school wrestling triumphs, tonsillectomies, hunting hauls and river voyages on a home-made cruiser, Noah's Place (later renamed PITA, short for Pain In The Ass, after it overheated and broke down halfway up the Columbia river). Over 54 editions Marie chronicled the surprise birth of twins, the premature death of Bob, her return to college, remarriage (at which point the Harris Herald became the Bussard-Harris Christmas Annual), promotion to college professor and the arrivals of 18 grandchildren, as well as more great-grandchildren than most readers could keep track of.
The Herald is the oldest archived example of a Christmas newsletter, a medium that, long before the internet, allowed the sharing (and over-sharing) of carefully curated news and photos to a wide network of friends and family. Most Christmas letters linger for a few weeks above the fireplace before being thrown away in the New Year clear-out. But historians are increasingly interested in the few that are kept. Like modern social media, the bulletins offer a window into everyday domestic life-or at least the version of it that the authors presented to the world.
Marie Harris was among the pioneers of a medium that emerged on both sides of the Atlantic after the second world war. People had exchanged Christmas cards with loved ones since Victorian times, when a wellchosen card was considered a present in itself. As incomes rose in the second half of the 20th century, people sent more cards; by the 1970s it was common to buy them by the box. The more cards people posted, the more of a pain it became to hand-write long messages.
So when technology allowed an insert to be copied, people did so. Marie's first Heralds were printed by mimeograph, a contraption that used a rotating drum to force blueish ink through a stencil made of waxed paper. Few people had access to such a thing (Marie used one at Oregon State College, where Bob worked as a lecturer). From the 1960s, photocopiers began popping up in offices. The smart new look of the BussardHarris Christmas Annual in 1961 was courtesy of the Xerox machine in the office of David Bussard, Marie's second husband. In the 1980s home computers and printers made it easier still to make newsletters; Marie's 1988 bulletin describes a ""rash"" of such missives.
As these letters became more common, people found ways to make them stand out. Photos began to appear (we first see the Harris-Bussards in 1975: Marie, in flares, reclining in an armchair as David perches by the fireplace). The 1990s brought an outbreak of Christmassy clip-art, with cheerful Santas sometimes incongruously placed next to reports of deceased pets. Around the same time, stationers began to sell Christmas-themed paper aimed at newsletter scribes.
Some authors expressed themselves in verse. A collection of newsletters held by Ann Burnett of North Dakota State University includes one written in 14 justabout-rhyming stanzas:
We travelled to Normandy
Where the Allies did land
And then on to London
Where we stayed at the Strand
Others extracted contributions from their children. When the novelty of that wore off some wrote imaginary missives from their pets. A letter in Ms Burnett's collection reads normally enough-one son is off to Yale, a grandchild is on the way, and so on-except that the notional authors are the family's cat and dog, both long dead and stuffed. A haunting photograph of the glass-eyed pair rounds off the bulletin.
A timeline of the years
As well as laughs, intentional and otherwise, letters like these provide a rich social history. In the 1990s paper sources began to disappear beneath a flood of emails and text messages. Susan B. Strange, an archivist at the Smithsonian Museum of American History, identified Christmas letters as an exception to this rule. In 1998 she began to collect them from friends, family and anyone else who had back issues to offload. The resulting haul of 1,500 missives, from about 100 families, ended up at Harvard's Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Women write about three-quarters of newsletters, Ms Strange estimates, providing an alternative historical perspective-albeit one that remains largely white and middle-class.
Health, work and travel are the enduring themes, and the archives illustrate how all three changed for Americans in the 20th century. In 1948 Marie recounted a brush with polio in which first her son, and then she herself, were forced to isolate in hospital. In a more recent letter from a different family, a 70-year-old marvels at her new prosthetic foot: ""A super duper, space age, technological marvel that will never hurt, nor fail nor any other thing."" In 1948 Bob Harris took on a Saturday job as a mechanic, which ""saved us from the very unpleasant effects of inflation"", running at nearly 10% that summer. Sixty years on the global financial crisis made its way into people's Christmas reflections. ""We are going to change our name to AiG-Chrysler in the hopes that the federal government will provide us with a bail-out,"" joked one American family in 2008. As the jet age arrived, tales of holidays made more frequent appearances. ""The trip to San Francisco takes less time than driving to the airport to catch the plane,"" marvelled Marie in 1962. Her vacations branched out from a trip to Palm Beach to tours of Australia, Fiji and South Africa in the 1990s.
A new preoccupation is with busyness. As one newsletter in Ms Burnett's collection puts it:
""I'm not sure whether writing a Christmas letter when I'm working at the speed of light is a good idea, but given the amount of time I have to devote to any single project, it's the only choice I have. We start every day at 4.45am, launch ourselves through the day at breakneck speed (the experience is much like sticking your head in a blender), only to land in a crumpled heap at 8.30pm...wondering how we made it through the day.""
More than two-thirds of newsletters mention time, usually the lack of it, Ms Burnett finds. She attributes this to the quickening pace of modern life. But it is difficult to resist the suspicion that there is a hint of showing off in some authors' complaints about their action-packed lives. The Christmas letter is, after all, the native environment of the humblebrag. ""While I would like to take credit for this, in truth it was more the Lord,"" writes a serial offender from Massachusetts. The next year he remarks: ""I like to think they gave me this award for the great job I did, but it is more likely they gave it to me so I would finally go away!"" Readers may wonder if that was indeed the case.
Comments like this explain why Christmas letters do not always spread good cheer. In 1954 an article in the Atlantic Monthly sent up the ""campy humour and covert bragging"" of the Christmas circular. By 1987 Marie felt the need to explain that ""although we read about people who don't like to receive Christmas letters, it is so hard to break old habits, especially one that started 39 years ago"". Debrett's, a British etiquette guide, advises that such newsletters are ""best avoided. They are impersonal and can seem boastful, especially if they are a rambling litany of the family's achievements.""
Those who love to hate the ""brag and gag"" variety of letter have found innovative ways to get their revenge. Christmas Letter Swap, a website, organises an annual 1 exchange of fictitious newsletters, as an antidote to the ""seasonal plague"". Simon Hoggart, a Guardian journalist, asked readers to send in their most-hated letters and received several hundred each year, from the sickening (""The cutest, cleverest and most advanced baby in the world!!!!!!!!"") to the soporific (""The gas men finally came on January 11th. They were supposed to come at the beginning of December""). Some recipients were so infuriated that they had ripped their letters up, and taped them back together to send him. And unlike social media, which offer a variety of ways to block showoffs and bores, mailed letters offer no escape.
Weariness with the format, and the growth of alternative ways to keep in touch, mean the newsletter is in decline. People are sending less Christmas post in general: the average American household received ten Christmas cards in 2019, compared with about 30 at the end of the 1980s. In 2017 Ms Burnett surveyed 200 newsletter senders and found that two-thirds no longer planned to write one. The main reasons cited for giving up, besides busyness, were the alternative of social media and the fear of being considered boastful. Carlos Llanso of America's Greeting Card Association says that his own company, Legacy, stopped selling Christmas-themed newsletter paper about five years ago, for lack of demand. ""Maybe people started thinking it was too much,"" he wonders.
Slow social media
The move from annual printed bulletins to daily electronic updates means that people are documenting more of their everyday life than ever before. But archivists worry that today's tweets and instant messages may prove harder to preserve than the stashes of newsletters. Even if the electronic musings survive, they record a different sort of history: a ""daily dribble"" of commentary, says Ms Strange, rather than the considered reflection on what mattered most that year.
Perhaps the bigger loss is not to posterity but to the authors themselves. Ms Burnett describes newsletterwriting as an opportunity for ""retrospective sensemaking"". As Marie scribbled to a friend in the margin of her circular of 1988, ""For me it is a sort of 'closure' for each year."" In the same way that Christmas itself invites reminiscence and reflection-a year almost done, memories of past Christmases jogged by each bauble unwrapped from the tissue paper-composing a newsletter requires contemplation of the year just past.
One result of that reflection is an awareness of life's finiteness. Whereas online posts are unlimited, life is capped at a few score annual letters. After launching the Herald when she was 28, Marie's life spanned 54 more issues; she was determined to make each count. In 1968, the year she turned 48, became a grandmother, hosted a Japanese exchange student and helped David build a new headquarters for the family business, she reflected on how much more there was to do:
""Possibly Marie's chief troubles is that she wants to be outside, wants to teach, wants to keep a good house, and be a good wife and mother. Life is too full of wonderful things to do, places to go, and people to know.""
The last Christmas letter of her life reflected on the couple's long marriage and the companionship of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, concluding: ""One could ask for little more than this."" Marie died on December 17th 2003, shortly after it was posted.
The Christmas newsletter isn't quite ready to fold. This year, in particular, may inspire reflection: journal-writing is sometimes prescribed to manage stress, points out Ms Burnett, who wonders if more people will want to record their thoughts this Christmas. Lockdowns have encouraged people to stay in touch by different means: the us Postal Service sold more stamps than usual over the summer, and in the autumn Christmas-card manufacturers reported higher sales than usual. Newsletter content may be a bit thin, with fewer weddings or glamorous holidays to relate. But the weeks trapped at home have got people into weird hobbies that they want to tell the world about, if social media are a guide.
Even before the lockdowns, signs were emerging that young people were getting back into hand-written media. In America millennials recently began to outspend baby-boomers on greeting cards, chiefly because they go in for pricey individual ones for special occasions, rather than the $10 boxes designed for mass mailing. Electronic communication is so effortless that it makes it hard to convey thoughtfulness. ""If you're having a bad time at work, or a much-loved pet has died, another text doesn't cut it,"" says Amanda Fergusson, head of the British Greeting Card Association, who says British millennials are also spending more on cards than they did a generation ago.
Two of Marie's children, as well as some of her grandchildren, now send Christmas newsletters of their own. And the first editions of the Herald continue to give pleasure. Robert Harris, the ""big healthy boy"" of six in 1949, recently re-read the back issues and saw his own early life through different eyes. ""It seems to be that my mother found a major voice for facing her life that comes through in her letters,"" he says. In that narrator, ""I didn't discover a different mother. I discovered a bigger mother."" Meanwhile, Marie's newsletter lives on. Seventeen years after her death, and nearly threequarters of a century on from the mimeograph and the green-shuttered farmhouse, Marie's surviving husband David will this year send out its 72nd issue.

Three months in the life of a French village reveals that isolation can mean solace as well as hardship
The road to Benivay-Ollon leads to nowhere else. It T winds up the valley along the course of the shallow Ayguemarse river, between craggy limestone outcrops and emerald-green forest, to a village of 66 souls. In summer the cicadas are insistent and the warm air is infused with the scent of wild rosemary. In winter morning dew gathers on the grass, and Mediterranean pines gleam defiantly in the watery light.
The village boasts no café, no shop, no post office, no boulangerie. Nobody passes through it by chance or even design. A visiting priest arrives up the road to celebrate mass at the church just twice a year. Once through the village, the road twists up to a ford over the water, and thenceforth turns into a dirt track that disappears into the forest. Perched improbably on a sheer-edged rock, accessible only by foot, the tiny 13thcentury stone chapel of Saint Jean watches over the valley like a sentinel.
On a bright June morning, Daniel Charrasse is to be found outside the mairie, or town hall. Aged 73, a slight figure with thinning silver hair, he is a retired apricot farmer who was born down the road and grew up in the village. He is now the mayor, a role treated locally more as an elder than a politician. At the most recent municipal election, 39 voters dropped his name into the ballot box. That was 87% of those cast. For much of the post-war period, Monsieur Charrasse's father Germain, who also grew apricots in the valley, was mayor. And in the 1920s so was Germain's uncle, Camille.
Tradition and loss are baked into the land in this isolated corner of France, which lies in the folds of mountains between the foothills of the Alps and the Mediterranean hinterland. Five years before the first world war broke out, Monsieur Charrasse's greatgrandfather Florent, born in the village in 1837, died, leaving his wife to run the farm with their four boys. When Germany declared war on France, all four sons were sent from the orchards and olive groves of the Ayguemarse valley to the mud and horror of the front, nearly 1,000km (621 miles) away. Paul, their second son, never made it back.
Paul was killed on the battlefield in the Vosges mountains in August 1914, during the first bloody weeks of war. He was one of six villagers who lost their lives, their names engraved in stone on the wall next to the town hall. Albert, Daniel's grandfather, and his two other brothers, Elie and Camille, all returned home to the valley, married and settled there. Albert's veteran's card shows a dapper young man with neat hair, in a wool jacket and waistcoat. Today their graves lie in Charrasse family plots in the square walled cemetery, a quiet spot up on the hillside, lined by cypress trees.
In remote villages and valleys across France, there are still communities like Bénivay, where the same family names can be found on the gravestones and the letterboxes. Craftmanship-the pressing of olives, the maturing of cheese, the training of vines-is passed on through the generations. France counts 8,780 communes with fewer than 200 inhabitants. To the metropolitan eye they are either places of community, tranquillity and tradition, or they are isolated and neglected parts of la France périphérique (peripheral France), constrained by narrowing options and a loss of population, living distrustfully on the margins. Bénivay suggests that neither view tells the full story.
The Charrasse family and the Bénivay valley are as intertwined as the farmers of this land are with the seasons and disasters they can bring. It doesn't take long in a conversation for a villager to raise the devastating winter that descended on the valley over 60 years ago. ""Until the frost of 1956, we produced a lot of olives and tilleuls (lime trees),"" says Monsieur Charrasse. ""But the frost hit the olive trees badly. For ten years, we produced no olives at all. That's when my father decided to plant apricot orchards and vineyards.""
The olive trees eventually recovered. When the mistral blows in from the Rhône valley, their feathery ash-green leaves catch the sunlight. But today, for better and for worse, the farm is centred on apricots. Pests attack the fire-orange fruit. Wild boar-an estimated 150 of them roam the surrounding forests-yank down 1 the branches to shake the apricots to the ground, breaking open the stones so that their young can feed on the kernels. They leave the flesh to rot in the ground. Nature dictates the orchards' fortune, just as the seasons do the working rhythms. In summer, when apricots ripen, the farmers are on the upper slopes of the Ayguemarse valley shortly after dawn and finish as the sun sets late in the evening, breaking in the sweltering heat of the day only for lunch.
The smallholding farmer, wrote Gaston Roupnel in his ""Histoire de la Campagne Française"", a history of the French countryside from 1932, is one whom ""the silent earth has disciplined with quiet tasks, endowed with the peace of the fields and the calm of the strong."" He might have been writing about the Bénivay valley. Beauty collides with hardship. Farmers do what they can to make ends meet. The Charrasse family rents out rooms to guests. Another runs a campsite farther down the valley. Other farms struggle, their backyards filled with the odd discarded mattress, rubber tyre, broken washing rack and dusty toys.
It is not an existence for everybody. Bénivay, like much of rural France for over a century, has seen its young pack up and leave. In 1911 the village counted 120 people. When Monsieur Charrasse was growing up, it was home to a dozen farming families. Today just three remain. As a child, he went to primary school in Bénivay, sitting at a wooden desk in a single class for pupils of all ages. In the 1970s the school closed. Two of his adult children have moved away. ""Their going is the most painful rejection"", wrote Daniel Halévy of the loss of the young from French villages, in his study of 1935, ""Visites aux paysans du Centre.""
As Monsieur Charrasse reflects on these changes, a tractor clatters past, pulling a trailer filled with plastic fruit crates. The young man at the wheel waves. Monsieur Charrasse smiles. It is his younger son, Florian. It turns out that he, like his father and grandfather before him, has become a farmer, taking over the family holding and becoming the third generation Charrasse to tend apricots in the valley.
The call of the wild
What keeps the 33-year-old Florian on the land? On an early morning in June, in a red baseball cap and bright blue т-shirt, he is to be found with his tractor up a dirt track on the hillside orchard for the cueillette, or fruitpicking. Daniel recalls that, in his time, the season used to last until late July or even into August. These days, warmer springs have brought the harvest forward. Every ripe apricot, creamy orange and tinged blush-red, is plucked by hand, and placed in a black plastic bucket suspended from a branch.
""Do you hear the sound of the leaves?"" asks Florian, as he gently twists a fruit to test its maturity. Just the right rustle indicates a judicious choice. ""It's very delicate, you just pull a little bit. If there are two on the branch you must always pick them both, or the second will fall to the ground. Choosing a ripe fruit is about the position on the branch, not necessarily the colour. The ones on the end of the branch are the ripest, so you start at the extremity. If they are ripe, you move towards the middle of the tree.""
Daniel watches his son quietly. The orchard he is tending is over half a century old. The elder Monsieur Charrasse is a man of few words. The French village, wrote Roupnel, is a place of conviviality, but ""over there, in the fields, the individual converses with silence, fed by dreams and solitude."" Yet he will say that he is ""proud"" his son has taken over. Florian always wanted to farm. ""I started helping my grandfather, Pépé, pick apricots when I was eight,"" he says. ""When I was about 13, he let me drive the tractor up here. I've always known this is what I want to do.""
The roots of belonging
""It's more of a commune than a village,"" reflects Simone Charrasse, the mayor's wife, one hot afternoon in July when the bugs are out. She is sweeping the front porch of the farmhouse through a multicoloured cattail fly curtain, awaiting two friends from a neighbouring farm. Madame Charrasse, who is 64, grew up on a farm in Bourdeaux, a bigger village farther north. Bénivay, she thinks, which lacks a main street or square, is more of a hamlet or collection of farms, ""although everyone here still knows each other.""
Does the word solitude speak to her? ""A bit,"" reflects Simone. ""There are moments, especially during the fruit harvest, when everyone keeps to themselves on their own land. It's the nature of the work."" Her friend and neighbour Edith Blanchard, who comes by for a cool drink, disagrees. ""I would call it zenitude, not solitude,"" she says. ""There are no people here that we don't talk to."" Neighbours drop in on each other. The town hall has a committee just for organising fetes, or parties. Each year in June there is a village celebration when the lime trees are in flower. Edith and her husband, Jean-Claude, meet friends to play cards, or boules in the shade beside the ford over the river. ""We don't miss restaurants, or the cinema,"" she says. Life under lockdown was traumatic for those in the city. In Bénivay it barely changed daily life.
Later on in the day, Florian arrives. ""My impression is that there is less solitude in the country than in the city,"" he ventures. ""In the city, there are lots of people, but you speak to nobody you pass by."" Often, ""the city"", or ""Paris"", are thrown into conversation as abstract concepts: the incomprehensible source of rules, paperwork and condescension. Nobody ever spontaneously names the prime minister or the president. It emerges that for Florian, though, Paris is part of his routine. Roughly 30 times a year, he drives his van down out of the valley to sell his freshly picked apricots-at three times the local retail price-at markets in the capital. Since the fruit-picking in June, he has done the 1,400km round trip four times.
""People say we live in a pays perdu (forgotten land),"" comments Simone. ""But forgotten by whom?"" In January a 4G-transmitter was built on the hilltop, supplying reliable mobile connection to the valley for the first time. Fibre-optic cable is on its way. Florian, who works with a farm-to-fork producers' network, is constantly on his smartphone to clients-a technology that his father wryly describes as ""a form of servitude"".
Real isolation, suggests Jean-Claude Blanchard, Edith's husband, a retired farmer and former mayor of the village, was that experienced by his parents' generation. Until a dirt road was dug up the valley in 1900, farmers would follow the river downstream, clambering in their leather boots over any rocks in their way. To take his produce to market, Monsieur Blanchard's grandfather would head up the steep hills on foot, or with a horse and cart, via a mountain pass. Today the road up to Bénivay is tarmacked, shrinking the 10kmdrive to the nearest shops to 15 minutes.
In recent times the road has brought new travellers: walkers, campers, even second-homeowners. They bring novel requests to the town hall, says Simone, such as better signposts for hiking trails. ""They have come here for the calm,"" she says, ""but the countryside is also noises, cockerels, tractors. We're working. Noises are everywhere."" One asked if the ringing of the church bell, which then began at 7am, could start a little later, she recalls. ""It's two different worlds.""
Apricots and ancestry
August, and Florian is sitting in the shade outside the farmhouse, rolling a cigarette and looking glum. The season turned out to be dreadful-he lost 85% of the apricot harvest due to winter frost-and not for the first time. Living off the land is unpredictable, and wearying. The more he converts to organic, the more rules he has to respect. The more the apricots disappoint, the more he turns to cherries, grapes and olives, jams, juices and tapenade. But he cannot imagine another life.
A farmer, Florian reflects, doesn't count in years. Time moves to a different beat. After the frost of 1956, his grandfather planted 1,000 olive trees. He talks of this grove as a custodian might of an heirloom. ""We've had apricot orchards here for only about 60 years; to be attached to them would be weird,"" Florian says. ""But the olive trees, they will be here for centuries.""
The people of Bénivay wear the weight of history casually. It lies all around them, in the fields, the graveyards, even on their bookshelves. When the mayor opens the archives one morning it yields treasures: records of births, marriages and deaths, handwritten in cursive script and organised in leather-bound volumes, reaching back to 1733-more than half a century before the French revolution.
The village registers reveal no fewer than nine generations of the Charrasse family. The records from the Napoleonic years show Daniel Charrasse's great-greatgrandfather to be Jean-Baptiste Florent (born in the village in 1806). The brittle pre-revolutionary parish registers, which bear the royal seal of the Dauphiné province, identify his father as Jean-Baptiste (born in the village in 1774), also a farmer. He was the son of Jean-Joseph (born in the village in 1740), whose parents were Joseph Charrasse and Marie Martel. Married in 1733, Joseph is listed as ""from Entrechaux"", a town all of 15km away-the original Charrasse newcomer to Bénivay.
Monsieur Charrasse seems only half-surprised to find his ancestors sitting silently at his side. Cest comme ça. It's just the way it is. Family legend, he says, is that the Charrasse family came over from Italy during the Avignon papacy of 1309-76. There is a book about them, he says. A copy, it turns out, lies in the Avignon public library, housed in a 14th-century cardinal's palace. Published in 1947, ""Histoire des Familles Charrasse"", co-written by one Alain Charrasse, traces the family back to Antonio de Carrassa, a cardinal's nephew, who settled nearby in around 1360. Despite the many Josephs, Jeans and Baptistes in the study, however, none matches the records for Daniel's family. The news prompts neither surprise nor disappointment.
The centuries-long continuity of the Charrasse family in this valley, resistant to the forces of revolution, war, poor harvest and pests, is not unique. The Mėge, Gras, Reynier and Blanchard families too are all still in the village, with ties to the past-and the future. One day Monsieur Blanchard mentions that his 23year-old grandson, Ludo, is expecting a baby. Having grown up in Bénivay, where his father and grandfather still live, he has now settled there with his partner, Alexia Rousseau. Ludo went to what his grandmother calls ""shepherd school"": an agricultural lycée, where he specialised in sheep-rearing. His dream is to buy a flock of his own-""beautiful ones""-and keep them near the mountain ridge.
""In the holidays, from the age of about seven or eight, I used to mind my great-grandfather's sheep, and I would bring them in at night by myself,"" explains Ludo, with his thick shock of black curly hair and beard. He is sitting with Alexia in their first-floor flat next to the mairie. Behind him, a pastoral scene of sheep in a valley is pinned to the wall. Ludo shudders at the evocation of city life: ""Things go so fast."" Bénivay, he observes, is where he feels at home. ""You can see people, but you can also go home and be alone.""
What does Alexia, who grew up in the city of Nantes on the Atlantic coast and used to enjoy hanging out in cafés, make of upland village life? The hunting, she confesses, has taken some getting used to. But the only thing she really misses, she says, is the sea. Could they imagine living anywhere else? Alexia laughs: ""We looked around a bit, but he said he couldn't live even in the next village down the valley."" Ludo concurs: ""I'm used to this landscape. I need to see the mountains in the morning.""
A few weeks later, Ludo and Alexia have a baby boy, named Mistral. He becomes the fourth generation of Blanchards living in the village today. New life has come to the valley, and with it a comforting stability of the sort that villagers also draw from the gnarled olive trees that defy the seasons and the clear edge of the unchanging mountain ridge at dawn. Bénivay bears the scars of ache, disappointment and loss. But it is also a place of belonging, serenity and survival. Lost, solitary, forgotten, perhaps; but still defiantly alive. ·

How malaria has shaped humanity
GOREE ISLAND, SENEGAL
Two centuries ago, at Anna Pépin's house on Gorée T Island, off the coast of Senegal, ladies with fashionably pointed hats sashayed up the stairs to sip fine wines in an airy salon with a stupendous view of the Atlantic. Under the staircase was a windowless punishment cell for recalcitrant slaves. Young, fertile women were separated from the other slaves, for reasons as obvious as they are odious.
Pépin, an Afro-French trafficker, must have heard her captives rattling their shackles as she shared canapés with her guests. If she looked down from her balcony, she must have seen them being pushed through a narrow opening-the ""door of no return""-and loaded onto ships bound for the Americas.
History is partly shaped by human choices. An evil institution cannot exist without evildoers. But history is also shaped by non-human forces. Why did plantation owners in the New World specifically want African slaves, rather than, say, Native Americans? One reason is malaria, notes Eloi Coly, the curator of the museum of slavery that Pépin's house has become.
Malaria was introduced to the Americas as part of the 16th-century Columbian exchange. Parasites crossed the ocean in the blood of slaves and settlers. Local Anopheles mosquitoes spread them. Soon, natives and Europeans were dying in huge numbers. But Africans tended to survive, even when forced to work in mosquito-infested sugar plantations, because of an inherited resistance to malaria. Planters in the West Indies would pay three times more for an African than for an indentured European, notes Sonia Shah in ""The Fever"". The mosquito, which also transmits other diseases, ""has played a greater role in shaping our story than any other animal,"" writes Timothy Winegard in ""The Mosquito"".
Stand again on Gorée Island and look in a different direction. Look past the children cooling in the surf, and the masked shopkeepers waiting for the covid-deterred tourists to come back. Stare towards the African mainland. Today the view is of skyscrapers and container ships-Dakar, Senegal's capital, is a thriving port. Back in 1805, when Mungo Park, a Scottish explorer, looked across this same narrow strait, he would have seen a small settlement and a vast expanse of forest. He spent a few weeks on Gorée before setting off for the continent's interior. It is not known whether he met Pépin, who would have been around 18 at the time.
He trekked inland, with tons of baggage loaded on donkeys, and then down the Niger River. Of the 40-odd men on his expedition, all but one died, many of fever. Park himself avoided death by malaria by leaping out of a canoe to escape a hail of arrows and drowning in rapids in what is now Nigeria.
Park's troubles illustrate a crucial fact about colonial history. Africa was-and remains-the continent where malaria is most virulent. European settlers tended to die of it. So they settled in large numbers only in the least malarial places: South Africa, with its cold winter nights that kill mosquitoes; the highlands of Kenya and Zimbabwe; and the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. In parts of west Africa, by contrast, settlers had a 50-50 chance of dying each year.
In the highly malarial parts of Africa, imperialists ruled indirectly, through local potentates, who were persuaded with threats and bribes to throw in their lot with the French or British empires. In non-malarial zones Europeans settled en masse, creating institutions, many of which last to this day, along with racial injustices that caused centuries of grievances. Malaria helps explain why modern South Africa, with 4.7m white citizens, is so different from Nigeria, which has only a handful of white expatriates. South Africa gave the world a universally recognisable euphemism for white supremacy. A quarter-century after apartheid ended, its scars still linger. Nigerian politics has different faultlines: Muslim versus Christian, and so on.
Malaria has shaped other continents, too. It was once widespread in Europe. One reason why ancient Rome was so hard to conquer was that it was protected by the Pontine marshes. The Romans thought the fe vers people caught there were caused by noxious fumes. Hence the name mal'aria, from ""bad air"".
In 218bc Hannibal crossed the Alps. He routed the Romans at the Trebia, Trasimene and Cannae, but full conquest eluded him because of malaria, which cost the Carthaginian general his right eye, his wife, his son and much of his army. Later invasions by assorted barbarians met a similar doom. ""The world still lives among the mosquito-haunted shadows of the Roman Empire,"" notes Mr Winegard-many countries speak a Latin-based language, while several political systems have adapted Roman law. Indeed ""the Roman Empire first martyred and then eased the passage of Christianity across Europe"".
Malaria shielded Rome for centuries. But nature does not stand still. Some time around the fifth century, a new breed of mosquito brought a new and deadlier parasite to Rome: Plasmodium falciparum, the malarial strain that blights Africa today. Unlike P vivax, to which the Romans were inured, P falciparum could have demoralised and destabilised an empire that was already under barbarian siege, speculates Ms Shah. The theory that it contributed to Rome's decline and fall, as well as its rise, is unproven, but plausible.
Parasites and people
A millennium later, malaria buffeted and then empowered another Roman institution: the Catholic church. Five popes probably died of it between 1492 and 1623. After it killed Pope Gregory XV, cardinals came to Rome to choose his successor. Six died of malaria. Eventually, the ailing head of one faction, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, was so desperate to go home that he backed a compromise candidate just to end the conclave. Thus, a mosquito helped elect Pope Urban VIII, as Fiammetta Rocco, an Economist writer, describes in ""The Miraculous Fever-Tree"".
Then, around 1630, Jesuit missionaries found a cure. In the mountains of Peru, they noticed that natives ingested the powdered bark of the cinchona tree when they were shivering with cold. They wondered if it might also treat malarial shivers. It did. The active ingredient was quinine. Soon it was known that the Jesuits could treat malaria-for a price. They jealously guarded their secret, and parlayed it into influence by healing kings and lords whose favour they desired.
In Britain, malaria may have ended a Protestant dictatorship. Oliver Cromwell, the man who had King Charles I beheaded, ruled as Lord Protector from 16531658. His puritanical decrees sucked the joy out of life as surely as mosquitoes suck blood. He closed theatres and banned make-up and Christmas decorations. He hated Catholics, which may be why he angrily refused an offer of ""Jesuits' powder"" to cure his malaria. The fever killed him, and merriment was re-legalised.
For centuries, there was never enough cinchona bark. Gradually, however, technology improved. In 1820 French chemists discovered how to extract quinine from cinchona. In 1865 a native braved execution to slip Bolivian cinchona seeds to a British trader. The Dutch government got hold of them and, after 30 years, figured out how to grow them in what is now Indonesia. By 1900 the Dutch were producing more than 5,000 tonnes of quinine a year.
When the second world war broke out, the Germans invaded the Netherlands and seized the Dutch stockpiles of quinine. The Japanese invaded Indonesia and seized the cinchona plantations. Suddenly the Axis powers had 95% of the world's quinine. This gave them a huge military advantage. Japanese forces occupied China, their much larger, mosquito-ridden neighbour, armed with malaria pills. (They also hired old ladies to tuck in sleeping soldiers' bednets.) Allied troops had far less protection. Malaria afflicted 60% of them in South-East Asia. On the island of Bataan, 85% of American and Filipino troops were malaria-struck when they surrendered to the Japanese. It was the largest surrender to a foreign power in American history. The New York Times noted that the battle was lost not for want of bullets, ""but because the quinine tablets gave out"".
Wartime demand spurred a race to invent a good substitute. German scientists got there first, with chloroquine. After the war, chloroquine was so widely used that parasites grew resistant to it. The race between science and evolution continues today.
The post-war period saw a big push to exterminate the Anopheles mosquito itself, by spraying its habitat with ddt, an insecticide so effective that America's Centres for Disease Control called it ""the atomic bomb of the insect world"". Prolific spraying caused mosquito populations to crash. By 1951 malaria had vanished from the United States. By 1964 the number of cases in India had fallen from 75m a year to fewer than 100,000.
But ddt also had side-effects. It persisted in the environment, and moved up the food chain. In America ddt was found in milk, after cows munched insecticide-laced grass. And mosquitoes evolved that could resist the chemical. In 1962 Rachel Carson published ""Silent Spring"", a book on the dangers of using pesticides without understanding their long-term effects. It led to a ban on ddt and helped kick-start the modern environmental movement.
It is intriguing to speculate how the world might look, had malaria never existed. If Hannibal had conquered Rome, would Europeans today speak languages derived from Punic instead of Latin? If the transatlantic slave trade had not been so lucrative, would America have avoided civil war and segregation? If the quinine-fortified Japanese army had not battered the Chinese nationalists so badly, would Mao Zedong's communists have been able to seize power?
Such questions are unanswerable. But humankind may one day discover what a world without malaria is like. The annual global death toll has roughly halved since 2000, to around 400,000. Rich countries have eliminated the disease: by draining swamps, spraying insecticide and sleeping in air-conditioned rooms.
In Africa malaria still kills multitudes of children and sickens adults, making it harder for them to work and obstructing the continent's path to prosperity. Yet it can be beaten. Senegal has all but conquered the disease in some regions and hopes to wipe it out nationwide by 2030. Despite the disruption of covid-19, that is feasible, thanks to a combination of bednets, pills and genomic technology.
An short drive from Dakar, in a district called Madina Fall, wide puddles fester on an unpaved road. Malaria has ravaged the area for thousands of years, but now it has all but gone. ""My older brother died of it. My younger sister died of it. I nearly died of it, too,"" says Bada Niang, a local worthy. ""Now, we have bednets, and it practically doesn't exist here any more."" ·"

Lives were lost and legends collided in a tumultuous stand-off that still echoes today
Turn off the Mile End Road in London's East End, walk a hundred metres and go back in time. It is January 3rd 1911, and in place of the block of flats with black railings stands a redbrick Victorian terrace. Just after dawn, policemen throw pebbles at a second-floor window. From inside comes a volley of bullets-the opening shots in six hours of mayhem. A sergeant collapses, struck in the chest.
So began the Siege of Sidney Street, a pyrotechnic showdown that sparked headlines and manhunts around the world. The anxieties it dramatised-over immigrants, extremism and the welcome both receive in London-remain acute today. So do the questions it raised about violence by and against the police, and over the perils of political grandstanding, in this case by Winston Churchill, then home secretary in Britain's Liberal government.
In one of history's arbitrary ricochets, the events paired Churchill with another figure destined to become a legend: a revolutionary known as Peter the Painter, once notorious from Canada to Australia yet so shadowy and elusive that some doubt he ever existed. Unfolding over a chilly Christmas season, the episode shows how villains can turn into heroes, flaws become virtues, and the past morph into myth.
In an urban landscape transformed by slum clearances and the Luftwaffe, you have to look hard for traces of this sensational affair. But they are there. A mile to the west of Sidney Street in Devonshire Square is a plaque honouring Robert Bentley, Charles Tucker and Walter Choate, police officers slain in the line of duty. This is where the story begins.
Their killers included veterans of prison breaks and guerrilla warfare in modern-day Latvia, victims of tsarist torture who expected the same treatment if they were caught again. In London they inhabited a milieu of radical ideas and exiles (including, a few years earlier, Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky). In their correspondence, obtained by police and kept in the London Metropolitan Archives (lma), the desperadoes come alive. They aver love and loyalty, defy death and solicit patience and money-in pursuit of which they planned ""expropriations"", otherwise known as robberies. In 1909 some of their number perpetrated the ""Tottenham Outrage"", a payroll heist that left four people dead.
On the night of December 16th 1910 the target was a jeweller's in Houndsditch, a commercial thoroughfare delineating the City from the East End, since remade in glass and steel. The gang rented premises behind the shop and set about breaking in. But they chose a Friday night, and the largely Jewish neighbourhood was quiet. Reports of suspicious noises attracted a policeman, then several, all unarmed. As well as the three fatalities, two officers were hurt when the criminals opened fire, in what was the worst-ever peacetime loss for British police. One robber, George Gardstein, alias Morountzeff, alias Milowitz, was hit in the melee. As he was dragged away, a passer-by took him for a drunk-until his comrades brandished their guns.
Follow the gang's getaway route, and for all the brash new towers you find that some things haven't changed. There is still a vertiginous drop in wealth as you head east from the City; the textile business still flourishes, albeit in South Asian rather than Jewish hands, the street markets offering kebabs instead of pickled herrings. Gardstein was left in squalid lodgings, where he was found, dead, the next day, along with weaponry and a membership card for an anarchist group named Leesma, meaning ""The Flame"".
In British public opinion and newspapers, the crime reinforced the link between immigrants and revolutionaries, who, as some are now, were organised into slippery cells and cherished a transnational cause. Thousands lined the streets for the victims' funeral at St Paul's Cathedral. The police posted a reward for the alleged kingpins in English, Russian and Yiddish- among them Peter the Painter. In wanted posters bearing that name, a moustachioed man poses insouciantly for an elegant studio portrait.
Blood and death
This ""dashingly handsome"" figure, says Nadia Valman of Queen Mary University of London, would enter the city's mythology, straddling the border between felon and icon. According to the posters, Peter went by the surnames Piatkow and Schtern. He was ""a native of Russia, an anarchist"". If the conspiracy was international, so was the chase. French police claimed Peter had lived in Marseilles. The Russians implicated him in a bomb plot in Crimea. A source placed him at an anarchist club in Paris, for which the password was ""Blood and death"". He spoke several languages and played the violin. He corresponded with subversives in Baku; a sweetheart pined for him in Kyiv.
That alliterative nickname contributed to his mystery. What did he paint-houses or portraits? (The sets for amateur dramatics, some suggested.) Was he an artist or a working man, ordinary or exceptional-or one disguised as the other? In a stroke of catchy branding, his moniker echoed that of the monster who had haunted London a generation earlier: Jack the Ripper.
The East End had a penumbra of informers, double agents and provocateurs. On New Year's Day an acquaintance tipped off police that the fugitives were hiding at 100 Sidney Street. Two days later Peter the Painter-the idea, if not the man-collided with Churchill and his own, carefully cultivated image.
He was in the bath when he got the call. Before dawn the police had evacuated the many other tenants of number 100; in the archives you can see a scrawled map they used to plan their ambush. But it was soon clear that their antiquated service weapons were no match for the brigands' pistols, and Churchill's authority was needed to summon a detachment of Scots Guards from the Tower of London.
Today, to imagine the carnage that ensued, you have to substitute the crack of bullets for the noise of the construction site across Sidney Street-occupied, in 1911, by a brewery, from the windows of which marksmen fired as others took aim from doorways, behind chimney pots or crouching in the slush. Inside the house the doomed men rushed between floors and windows to shoot back.
Though only 36, Churchill was a veteran of combat, with (like Peter the Painter) an adventurous and embroidered past. He had ridden into battle at Omdurman and helped relieve the siege of Malakand. He had been captured on an armoured train and broken out of a Boer prison. He dressed, hurried to the Home Office and was quickly on the scene, impelled by both ""convictions of duty"" and ""a strong sense of curiosity which perhaps it would have been well to keep in check"".
His cameo is preserved on jerky newsreel footage that played in cinemas almost immediately: the cameras made the siege ""the first breaking news story in history"", says Andrew Roberts, Churchill's most recent biographer. You can see the soldiers marching in, horses drawing up artillery, the puff of gun smoke and journalists huddling on the roof of the Rising Sun pub (since demolished, along with the Three Nuns, the anarchists' local). Police struggle to restrain the huge crowds that gathered-rooftop seats were going for ten shillings. And there, sheltering around a corner, is a youthful Churchill, expostulating theatrically in a top hat and an astrakhan-collared coat.
One story has it that Churchill's topper took a bullet-unlikely, says Mr Roberts, since ""if it had, he'd have kept it"". His presence was controversial, first among the spectators, some of whom lambasted his liberal approach to immigration, later in Parliament. ""I understand what the photographer was doing,"" chided Arthur Balfour, leader of the Conservative Party, which Churchill left in 1904 and would later rejoin. ""But what was the right-honourable gentleman doing?""
The answer, according to a newsreel caption, is that he was ""directing operations"". He suggested seeking metal plates in preparation for storming the house. When, in the lurid finale, the building caught fire-nobody knows how-Churchill approved the decision to keep the fire brigade away. ""I thought it better to let the house burn down, than spend good British lives in rescuing these ferocious rascals,"" he told Herbert Asquith, the prime minister. Newsreels show gallant firemen rushing in after the roof collapsed. One, Charles Pearson, died after being hit by falling masonry. (The policeman shot at daybreak survived.)
Two charred corpses, identified as William Sokoloff and Fritz Svaars, were found inside. One had been shot in the head; the other succumbed to the smoke. ""Everybody knows he must die some time,"" Svaars had written to relatives in Latvia on the eve of the siege. ""I know that if they catch me they will hang me."" There was no trace of Peter the Painter.
As shocking crimes can, the siege opened eyes. The police were given better weapons (Churchill oversaw the test firing). The chief constable of Sheffield sent down a bullet-proof shield, ""which may be of use when you find 'Peter the Painter'."" The investigation re-alerted the public to the overcrowded slumlands of the East End; Russia appealed for unity against the anarchist peril. Yet, as can also be true of such spectaculars, precisely what had happened was and remains unclear.
In May 1911 four members of the gang were tried at the Old Bailey in connection with the Houndsditch murders: Peter the Painter was not among them. The judge sank the charges by asserting that the three chief culprits had already ""met their doom"". Blaming Gardstein, Svaars and Sokoloff was certainly convenient for their comrades in the dock, and, after the extravaganza of Sidney Street, for the government. In fact, the role and whereabouts of the last two during the fatal robbery are still disputed.
Only Nina Vassileva, a Russian whose glamour and love-life inspired much comment, was convicted. Fingerprint evidence earned her a two-year sentence for conspiracy to rob-but even that was soon quashed. The others walked, including Jacob Peters, a cousin of Svaars who had been collared before the siege. He became a much-feared official in the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, before meeting a sticky end in 1938. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman and author of a book about the case, reckons Peters and Gardstein did the shooting in Houndsditch.
Angleshot Flavorum Enomotarch
""Don't be cross,"" Churchill implored a colleague after the siege, ""it was such fun."" But his rush to Sidney Street was among the misjudgments held against him until he became prime minister-whereupon, notes Mr Roberts, Churchill's ""almost obsessive need to be at the scene of the action"" became an asset. His direct observation of battles bolstered his grasp of the second world war (he would have joined the flotilla on D-Day had the king not intervened). His visits to districts shattered by the Blitz, during which he watched bombing raids from the roof of Downing Street, were ""extraordinarily good for morale"". In retrospect the siege, says Mr Roberts, was ""vintage Churchill"".
Peter the Painter evaporated. Exchanges with their foreign counterparts indicate that, lacking ""conclusive proof"" to tie him to the crimes, British detectives quietly stopped looking for him. Police forces from Naples to Winnipeg thought they had him. He was said to be working as a chef in Melbourne, ""posing as a Frenchman"" yet ""an excellent hand at throwing a knife or using a revolver"". The coded reply to Australia is stored in the LMA. ""Angleshot Flavorum Enomotarch"", the police telegrammed from London: ""not to be arrested"", as there was ""not sufficient evidence"" for an extradition.
It was too late: the fascination stirred by the wanted poster and sustained by rumour could not be stifled. Peter was widely held to have been in the burning house but somehow escaped. He was spotted in Denmark. He had moved to America. A police informer all along, his handlers had spirited him away.
Soon the saga was transfigured by art. Alfred Hitchcock grew up near Sidney Street, and in his original version of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1934), assassins hole up in a London house, spectators gather, a brave policeman knocks... In ""The Siege of Sidney Street"" (1960) Peter is a suave fanatic trailed by an undercover Donald Sinden. Trapped in the siege, Peter sets the fire, breaks through the walls and melts into the crowd. ""I wonder who it was that got away,"" Sinden's character muses when the bodies don't tally. In a TV drama of 2012 Peter leads an uprising of third-class passengers on the Titanic. In Emanuel Litvinoff's novel ""A Death out of Season"" (1973), he is sent by the tsarist secret police to plot the king's assassination, and so curtail Britain's tolerance of political refugees. But his heart is with the renegades.
Amid the hearsay and embellishments, records the ""Dictionary of National Biography"", doubts arose ""as to whether he existed at all"". Nothing about his life ""is altogether reliable"". In his book ""A Towering Flame"", Philip Ruff insists Peter was real. Citing tsarist files and unpublished memoirs, Mr Ruff says he is ""100% certain"" that the man in the poster was Janis Zhaklis. A socialdemocrat-turned-anarchist, Zhaklis had led a raid on a prison in Riga, robbed a bank in Helsinki and started a radical journal in America. Only peripherally involved in London, he fled to Brussels before, thinks Mr Ruff, becoming a businessman in Australia.
Maybe. But at this distance, identifying the ""real"" Peter the Painter is akin to finding the real Robin Hood, or perhaps King Arthur, both of whom his quicksilver image resembles-an indomitable will-o'-the-wisp who lives to fight another day. The fable spread: Irish insurgents called the type of pistol used by the anarchists a Peter the Painter. The flesh-and-blood man was subsumed by legend.
All this happened ""many moons ago"", says a resident of the flats in Sidney Street. But it is not entirely forgotten. Another plaque commemorates the fireman who perished. Walk away from the corner where Churchill huddled, passing women in headscarves who are heirs to the Edwardian immigrants, and you find two more blocks of flats: Siege House-and Painter House. Justifying that name, the local housing body said there was no evidence Peter had killed anyone. ""There is some doubt as to whether he existed,"" it stated, ""but his is the name that East Enders associate with the siege."" The man who wasn't there now always will be. ·

How data analysis can enrich the liberal arts
It all started with a preposition. In 1941 Father Roberto Busa, a Roman Catholic priest, started noting down as many uses of the word ""in"" as he could find in the Latin work of Thomas Aquinas, a medieval theologian and saint. Eight years and 10,000 handwritten cards later he completed his linguistic analysis of Aquinas's ""interiority""-his introspective faith-at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University. By then he had a suspicion that his work could be done far more efficiently. He started hunting for ""some type of machinery"" to speed up his new project, recording the context of all 10m words written by Aquinas.
Father Busa's zeal took him to the office of Thomas Watson, ibm's chairman. Soon he had switched from handwritten cards to ibm's punch-card machines, before adopting magnetic tape in the 1950s. In the 1960s dozens of full-time typists were involved. By 1980, when his team finally printed the ""Index Thomisticus"" in 56 volumes, they had spooled through 1,500km (930 miles) of tape. A cd-rom containing 1.4GB of data came out in 1992, with a website following in 2005. The 97year-old priest died in 2011. But not before he had initiated a new quest, to annotate the syntax of every sentence in the Index Thomisticus database.
Such is the creation story of the digital humanities, a broad academic field including all sorts of crossovers between computing and the arts. The advances since its punch-card genesis have been ""enormously greater and better than I could then imagine,"" remarked Father Busa in his old age. ""Digitus Dei est hic! [The finger of God is here!]"" Almost every humanistic composition imaginable has been rendered in bytes. Aquinas's works are a speck in the corpus of Google Books, which contains at least 25m volumes and perhaps two trillion words. Naxos, a music service, has annotated 2.4m classical pieces with authorial biographies and instrumentation. Spotify, a streaming service, has 60m tunes, each with metadata about tempo, time signatures and timbre.
What started as a niche pursuit is growing rapidly. Google Scholar now contains about 75,000 academic articles and essays that mention ""digital humanities"". That total is already bigger than for ""Napoleon Bonaparte"" (57,000) or ""Romeo and Juliet"" (66,000). Nearly half of the 75,000 articles were published since 2016.
Time and the machine
Digitisation's clearest benefits are speed and scale. Because of decades of exponential growth in computing sophistication, projects that once lasted a lifetime- literally, for Father Busa-now require a fraction of it. Take the work of Barbara McGillivray at the Alan Turing Institute, Britain's national centre for data science. Having done her PhD in computational linguistics on the ""Index Thomisticus"", she wanted to create a similar resource for ancient Greek. After starting as the institute's first humanist in 2017, she and a colleague needed just three months to convert 12 centuries of classics into an annotated corpus of 10m words. The final product compresses Homer, Socrates and Plato into 2.5GB 1 of tidy Extensible Markup Language (xml), complete with the grammatical properties of each word.
Curating such enormous archives is just the starting-point. The trick is to turn the data into interesting findings. Researchers have been trying to do that from almost the time when Father Busa began punching cards. From the late 1950s Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace, two statisticians, spent several years using a desk-sized ibm 7090 to calculate the frequency of words in the Federalist papers, written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay. They inferred that 12 anonymous essays were probably written by Madison, based on certain tics. He rarely used ""upon"", for example, whereas Hamilton often did.
Advances in machine learning have given Ms McGillivray a far shinier array of tools. Along with four co-authors, she tested whether an algorithm could track the meaning of Greek words over time. They manually translated 1,400 instances of the noun kosmos, which initially tended to denote ""order"", then later shifted to ""world"" (a celestial meaning that survives in the English ""cosmos""). Encouragingly, the machine agreed. A statistical model reckoned that in 700BC kosmos was frequently surrounded by ""man"", ""call"" and ""marketplace"", a cluster suggesting ""order"". By 100AD a second cluster emerged, suggesting ""world"": ""god"", ""appear"" and ""space"".
The thrill of getting ""a computer to blindly agree with us"", explains Ms McGillivray, is that she could now apply it easily to the 64,000 other distinct words in the corpus. She has already spotted that paradeisos, a Persian loan-word for ""garden"", took on its theological context of ""woman"", ""god"" and ""eat"" around 300BC, when the Old Testament was first translated into Greek. At a few keystrokes, the algorithm tapped into one of history's great intellectual exchanges, between Judaistic theology and Greek literature.
Take a byte
The most compelling number-crunching of this sort has focused on English writing from 1750-1900, thanks to that era's rapid expansion of printed texts. Such Victorian data-mining has mostly taken place in America. The Stanford Literary Lab was established in 2010. In contrast to ""close reading"", by which humans spot nuances on a couple of pages, the lab's 60-odd contributors have pioneered ""distant reading"", by getting computers to detect undercurrents in oceans of text.
An early project dredged through nearly 3,000 British novels from 1785-1900, to examine which types of language had gone in and out of style. The authors, Ryan Heuser and Long Le-Khac, developed a tool called ""the Correlator"", which calculates how frequently a given word appeared in each decade, and which other words experienced similar fluctuations. Though the maths was crude, it provided some surprisingly coherent clusters: ""elm"", ""beech"" and ""branch"" closely tracked ""tree"", for example. In order to detect broader trends, the authors then hunted for clusters that demonstrated sustained rises or falls in popularity.
First they took the words ""integrity"", ""modesty"", ""sensibility"", and ""reason"", and built a cohort of 326 abstract words correlated with them. These sentimental and moralistic terms fell increasingly out of fashion, from providing roughly 1% of all words in 1785 to half that in 1900. To provide a contrast, they then looked for a cohort of concrete terms. They found 508 correlates of the word ""hard"". These fell into distinct sub-clusters: actions (""see"", ""come"", ""go""), body parts (""eyes"", ""hand"", ""face""), physical adjectives (""round"", ""low"", ""clear""), numbers and colours. Across the period, this ""hard"" cohort rose from 2.5% of words to nearly 6%. This was a pattern that led from Elizabeth Bennet's decorous drawing room to Sherlock Holmes' shady alleys. Strikingly, the trend-lines suggested that the movement from abstract words to concrete ones had been steady, rather than a sudden Dickensian shift (see chart 1on previous page).
Such quantitative studies don't have to overturn grand theories to be interesting. The Correlator's findings could sit comfortably within many books about the rise of novelistic realism. Sometimes, the benefit (and pleasure) of crunching literary data comes simply from measuring the strength and timing of historical tides. A second study from the Stanford Literary Lab concurred that 19th-century British novelists gradually removed sentimental words. The author, Holst Katsma, found a steady decline in melodramatic speaking verbs. ""Exclaimed"", ""cried"" and ""shouted"" accounted for 19% of utterances in around 1800, but only 6% by 1900. (Novelists became fonder of ""said"".)
Nonetheless, digital humanists enjoy going against the grain. Few have found as many quirky statistical patterns as Ted Underwood, a lecturer in English and computer science at the University of Illinois. In 2016 Mr Underwood decided to try to see what percentage of descriptions in contemporary novels are about female characters, and how this changed over time.
Mr Underwood took nearly 100,000 novels from 1800-2009 and an algorithm that apportions nouns, adjectives and verbs to specific characters. He found that women received about 50% of descriptions in 1800, but barely 30% by 1950 (see chart 2). This mirrored a similar fall in the share of novels by female authors. As writing became more lucrative, it veered away from the world of genteel ladies to that of grubby men. It was only after 1950 that female authorship and characterisation rebounded. Sabrina Lee, one of Mr Underwood's colleagues, notes that this coincided with the rise of paperback publishing and romance imprints. Even so, women's share of writing and descrip tion remained around 40% in 2010.
Some of Mr Underwood's investigations require little modelling and a lot of counting, such as an article that examined a sweeping literary claim by Thomas Piketty, an economist. Mr Piketty reckoned that widespread inflation after 1914 made people warier of wealth, and so ""money-at least in the form of specific amounts-virtually disappeared from literature"".
Instinctively, Mr Piketty's claim may feel true. Victorian characters often agonised over inheritance or debt, such as reckless Fred Vincy in ""Middlemarch"", who constantly counts the pounds and shillings he has gambled away. By contrast ""The Great Gatsby"", a modernist meditation on the ""young and rich and wild"", mentions dollars just ten times. However, after combing through 7,700 novels from 1750-1950, Mr Underwood and his co-authors found that these were outliers. The rate at which authors referenced specific amounts of cash nearly doubled in that period (see chart 3). One explanation is that their characters tended to use pocket change more often. The median amount mentioned fell from nearly 60% of annual income to less than 5%.
Because e-books are abundant and computational linguistics dates back to the dawn of the digital age, most humanistic number-crunching so far has been literary in nature. But other subjects are starting to produce peer-reviewed quantitative studies, too. In history, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published a paper in 2018 that found Maximilien Robespierre was the most influential rhetorician of the French revolution. The authors judged this by how often members of the National Constituent Assembly copied his innovations during 40,000 speeches. In anthropology, a team of researchers published an article in Nature in 2019 that examined how religions developed, using a 10,000-year dataset of 414 civilisations. They found that societies tended to adopt moralising gods after they had already created complex hierarchies and infrastructure. This challenges the idea that humans needed divine rules in order to band together.
Similarly, a study on painting from 2018 found that Piet Mondrian, a Dutch modernist, dabbled with a much wider range of colour contrasts during his career than his European contemporaries. And a paper from 2020 calculated that Sergei Rachmaninoff composed the most distinctive piano pieces relative to his peers, using a similar measure of innovation to the one in the Robespierre paper (but judging by groups of notes, rather than words).
Despite data science's exciting possibilities, plenty of academics object to it. The number-crunchers are not always specialists in the arts, they point out. Their results can be predictable, and the maths is reductive and sometimes sketchy. So too are the perspectives often white, male and Western. Many also fear that funding for computer-based projects could impoverish traditional scholarship. Three academics complained in the Los Angeles Review of Books in 2016 that this ""unparalleled level of material support"" is part of the ""corporatist restructuring of the humanities"", fostered by an obsession with measurable results.
Brave new world
The arts can indeed seem as if they are under threat. Australia's education ministry is doubling fees for history and philosophy while cutting those for stem subjects. Since 2017 America's Republican Party has tried to close down the National Endowment for the Humanities (neh), a federal agency, only to be thwarted in Congress. In Britain, Dominic Cummings-who until November 2020 worked as the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, the prime minister-advocates for greater numeracy while decrying the prominence of bluffing ""Oxbridge humanities graduates"". (Both men studied arts subjects at Oxford.)
However, little evidence yet exists that the burgeoning field of digital humanities is bankrupting the world of ink-stained books. Since the neh set up an office for the discipline in 2008, it has received just $60m of its $1.6bn kitty. Indeed, reuniting the humanities with sciences might protect their future. Dame Marina Warner, president of the Royal Society of Literature in London, points out that part of the problem is that ""we've driven a great barrier"" between the arts and stem subjects. This separation risks portraying the humanities as a trivial pursuit, rather than a necessary complement to scientific learning.
Until comparatively recently, no such division existed. Omar Khayyam wrote verse and cubic equations, Ada Lovelace believed science was poetical and Bertrand Russell won the Nobel prize for literature. In that tradition, Dame Marina proposes that all undergraduates take at least one course in both humanities and sciences, ideally with a language and computing. Introducing such a system in Britain would be ""a cause for optimism"", she thinks. Most American universities already offer that breadth, which may explain why quantitative literary criticism thrived there. The sciences could benefit, too. Studies of junior doctors in America have found that those who engage with the arts score higher on tests of empathy.
Ms McGillivray says she has witnessed a ""generational shift"" since she was an undergraduate in the late 1990s. Mixing her love of mathematics and classics was not an option, so she spent seven years getting degrees in both. Now she sees lots of humanities students ""who are really keen to learn about programming and statistics"". A recent paper she co-wrote suggested that British arts courses could offer basic coding lessons. One day, she reckons, ""It's going to happen.""
At a few keystrokes, the algorithm tapped into one of history's great intellectual exchanges

IN THE GOLDEN age of comic books, American children devoured stories about fantastical superheroes. The National Urban League, an organisation devoted to racial justice, published a comic of its own, Negro Heroes, filled with inspirational black people it had no need to invent. Its 1948 issue featured Jackie Robinson, who had recently broken baseball's colour bar, on the cover. But it also celebrated a less obvious figure: Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, one of the league's leading lights and the first African-American to earn a PhD in economics. ""You will get a real thrill as you read about these people,"" it promised.
Economists are reviving Alexander, born in Philadelphia in 1898, as a heroine for today. In 2018 a pair of young black women formed the Sadie Collective to help others pursue careers in the field. In 2021 the National Economic Association, a group supporting minorities, will celebrate the centenary of Alexander's PhD award at their annual gathering. Nina Banks, author of a forthcoming biography, notes that economists have done a poor job of including women or African-Americans in the history of economic thought. Alexander's career shows what they are missing.
Like many comic-book heroes, she combined an illustrious lineage with early adversity. Her grandfather was a much-published bishop, her uncle was a renowned painter, her father was the first black American to graduate in law from the University of Pennsylvania and her aunt was the first black woman certified to practise medicine in Alabama. She attended the prestigious M Street High School, which often hosted the country's leading black intellectuals. ""We studied Negro history from living exhibits-not history books,"" she said. But her father ran off when she was only a year old, vanishing so completely from her life that she assumed he was dead until her teenage years.
Starting as an undergraduate in Penn's School of Education in 1916, she faced disdain for her ambitions, followed by resentment at her achievements. No one told her how to find the right classroom or the right books. Her first-year classmates barely spoke to her- except one, who befriended her, then tried to copy her exams. A fellowship to pursue graduate work was initially denied to her after a librarian accused her of meddling with another student's books. He had mistaken her for another black woman on campus. ""Such circumstances made a student either a dropout or a survivor so strong that she could not be overcome, regardless of the indignities,"" Alexander later said.
Her heroism was of the quiet sort. She responded to slights with an almost militant courtesy. At a regular tea organised by the students, she was not trusted to contribute sandwiches but asked to bring olives instead. In response, she asked her grandfather's cook (who had previously worked at the governor's mansion in Bermuda) to prepare something special. When she unwrapped the beautiful sandwiches, ""all eyes were agog and mouths watering"".
Alexander was awarded her PhD in a blaze of publicity. She recalled marching down Broad Street with photographers ""shooting her from every side"". She and the press initially thought she was the first black American woman to get a PhD in any subject-a misconception she was not always careful to correct. (Georgiana Simpson, a teacher at м Street High School, received her PhD a day earlier.) Alexander's elation faded quickly when she tried to get a job worthy of her talents. She spent two lonely years with an insurance firm in North Carolina, then another year as a housewife (""I...almost lost my mind"") before returning to Penn to get a law degree.
Her subsequent career as a lawyer and activist was full of zap and pow. After joining her husband's law firm in 1927, the pair helped desegregate Philadelphia's hotels, theatres and cinemas, offering to represent, without charge, any victim of segregation prepared to show up in court. They had the manager of the cinema opposite their law office arrested so often he eventual- ly appeared before them waving a handkerchief in surrender. In 1947 she was appointed to President Harry Truman's committee on civil rights, alongside Charles Wilson, the boss of General Electric, and Franklin Roosevelt, son of the previous president. (Even so, the Hotel Statler in Washington, dc would not seat her for lunch until Mr Wilson intervened.)
It is tempting to see Alexander's exit from economics as an early example of the discipline's particular difficulty in retaining black scholars. That would be a mistake, argues Ms Banks. Alexander's years as an economics PhD student were her happiest at Penn. ""I was the pet, the darling of the faculty,"" she recalled. The head of the university's insurance department was incensed that he could not find her a better job. The obstacles she faced were imposed by society at large. The two black women who received PhDs in the same year in other subjects took years to find university jobs.
Although she had to leave academic economics, the discipline never left her. Her many speeches and writings show that she continued to think of herself as an economist. She cited statistics more often than legal cases. She believed that steady, productive employment was both an index of racial justice and a means of attaining it. And her ideas evolved in response to the economic trends of the day.
A neglected stream
Her dissertation was prompted by the migration of 40,000 southern blacks to Philadelphia's factories during the first world war. Alexander wanted to know whether the mostly ""untrained, illiterate"" newcomers would adapt to an industrial economy or drag down Philadelphia's existing black population, a community ""of culture, education and some financial means"".
As a black woman, she won intimate access to the financial lives of 100 migrant households, documenting their spending on everything from kerosene to vaudeville tickets. The migrants were corralled into overcrowded, overpriced homes. Alexander noted falling plaster, broken floorboards and the ""vile"" odour from toilets in disrepair. But the households did not rely on charity. And 64% earned enough to afford a fair standard of living, as she calculated it, provided they could rent housing on the same terms as white families and avoid ""unwise"" spending decisions, such as buying things in smaller quantities than necessary.
Her foray into field work and her eye for behavioural quirks fit surprisingly well with today's fashions in economics. The discipline has moved on from armchair theorising about rationally optimising agents. But fashions can be circular, and her dissertation was in keeping with its own times as well as today's. The distinction between economics and sociology was fuzzier than it became after the second world war. Similar surveys had been carried out by black scholars like W.E.B. Du Bois, who published ""The Philadelphia Negro"" in 1899. If Alexander's work now seems novel it may be only because economists have lost sight of this tradition. Perhaps not coincidentally, the work was often carried out by scholars-black, female or both- who were themselves marginalised, says Dan Hirschman of Brown University.
After leaving university, Alexander wove her economic ideas into her speeches and articles. She argued that factory jobs were more dignified than household drudgery, which was priceless and therefore thankless. She welcomed the fact that many black women worked outside their homes, but complained that they were often employed ""unproductively"". Two-thirds earned a pittance as servants, she reported during the Great Depression. The remainder were mostly farmhands. ""We still find barefoot Negro women hoeing, planting and picking the crops. Theirs is not even an existence; it is a fight for...survival.""
Some policies designed to relieve the Depression neglected black workers. New pensions and unemployment insurance introduced in 1935 left out both servants and farm labourers. ""It is clear that in his years of planning for Social Security of the common man, Mr Roosevelt never had in mind the security of the American Negro,"" she said. Other policies made things worse. Many blacks in the South could get only jobs that whites did not want at pay they would not accept. When the National Industrial Recovery Act lifted the wages and prestige of these jobs, blacks lost them. Roosevelt's national recovery act, she thought, might as well be called the ""Negro Reduction Act"".
In a downturn, when people are reluctant to spend, there are only so many jobs to go round. White workers vie with blacks-one source of racial friction between them. But mobilisation for the second world war showed that another economy was possible. The huge increase in wartime spending created 10m jobs, vindicating the Keynesian ideas that Alexander also embraced. To maintain full employment in peacetime, she argued that the government should tax idle profits (spending the proceeds on public investment) and bolster the purchasing power of idled workers. This spending would contribute to high employment and high employment would sustain liberal spending.
The need for full employment featured prominently in the National Urban League's annual conference in 1944. Black workers were ""the last to be hired and the first to be fired"" when employment was anything less than full, as Alexander pointed out. With steady jobs, blacks could acquire seniority, skills and the solidarity of union membership. By removing white workers' ""fears of economic rivalry"", full employment would also ease racial prejudice and repair American democracy. Economic insecurity, on the other hand, would encourage people to support demagogic leaders, lured by the ""vain promises of a self-proclaimed messiah"". Her warning, Ms Banks says, ""speaks to our time"".
As the country prepared to demobilise in 1945, Alexander urged black workers to act with a ""deep sense of responsibility"" to each other. She worried that ""absenteeism, lateness, loafing on the job"" by any black worker would harm the prospects of all. She felt the same heavy burden of responsibility in her own professional life. Her grades were as eye-catching as her sandwiches. Her court petitions were fastidious. Her proposal to Philadelphia for a civil-rights commission was accepted ""without removing a comma"". After becoming pregnant, she stayed at her legal post for as long as possible, ""both for myself and for all women"".
Her response to the unreasonable demands placed on her was not to reject them but to exceed them. ""I felt the burdens of the world on my shoulders,"" she once said. Alexander is being rightly revived as an inspirational hero for today. But few could follow her example. And none should have to.
Her eye for behavioural quirks fits surprisingly well with today's fashions in economics"

What is the lure of pebbles for a man who lives surrounded by them?
BRIGHTON
At around half past eight on a warm late-summer morning, Rory McCormack trudges across the shingle of Brighton beach. He is a short, solid figure in baggy clothes and walking boots, with a duffel bag on his shoulder. Everything about him is weathered, tanned and worn, but livened with an air of independence. His greying brown hair blows round his face, which is as weathered as a fisherman's would be. And a fisherman he is, the last still working from the beach in a city that long since gave itself over to pleasure rather than fish. But to folk in Brighton-few of whom have ever seen him-he is the Pebble Sculpture man.
He is making for his compound, a rusty wire-mesh enclosure perhaps 25 metres square, crammed with what seem to be lively stalagmites but are, in fact, tall statues made of stones. On the way he pauses to pick a pebble up. It is something almost everyone does instinctively, drawn by their contours, their colour, or the way they catch the light. But some people do it obsessively, with purpose, in quantity, and he is one. As he says, it's very hard to stop looking.
Pebbles, as opposed to stones, have certain qualities. They are smoothed by wind or water, and mostly of a size that fits the hollow of the palm of a hand. There are plenty here-614,600,600, pub-quizzers saygraded as the beach descends. The largest, those offering the best grip to the waves, are flung above the hightide line; the smallest congregate and chorus at the edge of the sand. A shingle beach is a transient thing, edged continually sideways by longshore drift that follows the wind. Each pebble is also a work in progress, from commanding cliff to silt, being to nothingness.
Most beach pebbles, like this specimen, are the size of a new potato. Rory appraises it carefully, then discards it. At the wire gate, barred with several windings of heavily rusted chains, he pauses again to kick away the accumulated shingle that stops it opening. The fascination of pebbles is balanced by the nuisance of them. He loves them and hates them and, either way, they fill his life.
He opens the gate only as far as is needed to grab a spade. Then he walks back across the shingle to the ridge that marks the drop to the tideline, and starts furiously digging. The ridge, like others along the beach, has been thrown up by exceptional tides and storms; the bigger the storm, the higher the ridge, and the deeper the load of stones that can bury wrecks, foundations of houses or the stumps of ancient forests. The space between each ridge marks an interval of time. It is history itself that Rory is digging through. A passing cyclist watches him in awe. But what he is also doing is restoring the slipway from his compound to the sea, to get his boat out. Covid-19 stopped him fishing, but for a couple of months now he has presumed he can go.
His family came down to Brighton in the 1960s; he took up fishing and got a concrete standing for his boat on the beach. Gradually all the other fishermen died or departed, but he stayed, with his flotsam of gear expanding round him. And, surrounded by pebbles as he was, he began to give them his consideration-or, as he usually puts it, play around with them.
Arranging nothingness
Not many would bother. A shingle beach appears to have no features at all, and to sustain nothing living. The ""Observer's Book of Sea and Seashore"" dismisses these beaches as ""the nearest approach to a desert our islands can show"". Rory disagrees with that. It may be nothingness but, as he puts it, ""Nothingness can be rearranged."" It can grow things, for a start. Just outside his fence there are sizeable clumps of sea-kale and silver ragwort. (Blanched sea-kale stems, according to Richard Mabey, doyen of foraging, are very good with sauce hollandaise.) Inside he has a vegetable bed with more kale, sea-beet and horseradish. He admits that he has cheated here, importing some topsoil from municipal flower-beds to help. But he didn't have to, for the long taproots of these plants can reach three feet or more through the shingle to fresh water. And a mulch of seaweed, as much as you can get, will do instead of soil. There are places right out on the Kemp Town shingle, the deepest part of Brighton beach, where dandelions grow. He knows some spots, towards Hove, where there are wild tomatoes. The desert can flower.
Is it good for anything else? At first, he thought he might build a house. He had done dry-stone walling for a spell. Primitive coal, full of sulphur, stinking as it burns, is sometimes brought in on the tide; he could mix coal-ash, sand and chalk together to make mortar. Most of the pebbles are rugged, durable nodules of flint washed out of the local chalk cliffs. But they are still too slippery and smooth for house-building. Plenty were incorporated, with other rubbishy ingredients, into the speculative Regency builds that became the grand terraces of Kemp Town; this blend, called ""bungaroosh"", was so unstable that much of Brighton, it is said, could be demolished with a well-aimed hose.
A pebble house, then, was not a good idea. Even his pebble sculptures seemed unfeasible at first, just an insecure mound of stones. But once he had cracked the flints open with a hammer, to get a flat face with more angular edges, he could build an outside frame and pack it with pebbles into big, durable shapes. He began about eight years ago, in a bad winter, by making a simple workbench to clean his fish on. Then he thought he might make it prettier with pebbles of different sorts. And so the enterprise has gone on, and on.
His compound is now crammed as tightly as it can be with sculptures of every size and shape. Monumental figures of flint and brick pebbles alternate with smaller, friskier humanoids who dance among them. He has to turn sideways in places, ducking under a heavily decorated arch and along a pathway of flints inlaid with medallions of seagulls. Flint is naturally the dominant theme, ranging through black, blue and grey; red brick comes next; but then everything is picked out with the other hues the beach has to offer. Shingle seems merely brown from a distance, or at best an array of pointillist browns and greys. But Rory knows where to get pure yellows, purples, greens (and, for whites, the ubiquitous stone-like shells of slipperlimpets). He has found mysterious chunks of pink marble, stones with crystal in them, and a greenish flint that looks like obsidian. Anything you want, he says, is just sitting there waiting.
In Victorian times collectors combed this beach, looking for-and finding-amethyst, chalcedony, carnelian, jasper and onyx. A national craze began as they broke these semi-precious stones open with small hammers, polished them and put them in cabinets to display. The Bible of pebble-picking, Clarence Ellis's ""The Pebbles on the Beach"" of 1954, was reissued in 2018 as if, with the growth of green consciousness, the pastime might be fashionable again. But Ellis already expected to find nothing of great interest left in Brighton. The Crystal Shop in the city's North Laine, round which the smell of joss-sticks lingers thick, sells azurite from Morocco and amethyst from Brazil, but advertises nothing local. When local pebbles find their way to the city's boutiques they have been strangely denatured, painted with flowers and birds, or mounted in a collage as the bodies of dogs and cats. Rory has no time for this ""jewellery"". He likes them as they are.
Besides, his inspiration is quite different. It is ancient civilisations, figures from the distant past: figures, in other words, as ancient as the pebbles are. Most of his statues are modelled on figurines from the Bronze Age, sometimes from the Stone Age, and scaled up. To these he has added gods and goddesses from pre-Classical Greece, with excursions into the Incas, the Sumerians and the Egyptians. He never learned any of this at school, which he left at 16 to fish; but between his trips to get bass, mackerel or spider crabs he has read deeply in these subjects. His towering Pan-pipe player, ten feet tall, is a Cycladic figure of the Bronze Age. The Venus of Willendorf looms along the path, her ample backside supported by a bone-chewing dog. A Cycladic harpist plays by the fence, and beside his rickety shed a Sumerian goddess cradles her child. From the midst of the figures a stone seagull peers out, a portrait of a persistent friend. He is wearing the double crown of Horus, the Egyptian falcon-god.
For Rory these close-packed gods seem alive. If he deviates just a bit in his copying of their forms, they lose their power. Seen by the light of a full moon, especially, he finds ""an air of mystique"" about them. He is not inclined to get much more philosophical than that. The idea that a pebble with a hole through it represents the Buddhist idea of sunyata, the emptiness from which anything may come, earns only a grunt. He would not keep a pebble on his desk, as some folk do, to represent stillness or silence or the near-infinite compression of vast time. For him a pebble has to have a practical, if artistic, use. But he likes the thought that in cave-tombs collections of pebbles that look like faces, horses or hearts are often buried with the dead, because that is how modern humans sort them, too.
Now, however, he has work to do before the beach gets fuller. In an average year as many as 11m people pour onto it. The shingle does not put them off. Many, indeed, prefer it to sand: less intrusive, and (though painful to feet) quickly moulding to the form of a reclining body. People spend hours on it, losing things more easily than they lose them on sand, leaving treasure for the detectorists who swing slowly over in the mornings. What they leave behind-spoons, earrings, rope, broken toys-works its way into Rory's statues, too. As the trippers sit and chat, their hands instinctively find pebbles, caress them, knead them, and ultimately throw them-as if the only use of pebbles is to hit a target, and occasionally to fell giants.
Marking time, stone by stone
Rory sometimes thinks even less of them. They make a rotten beach to fish from, wearing out the bottom of his boat and obstructing its passage. He thinks ruefully of tractors, even oxen, that do the job on other shores. Much of his dogged digging today seems to have gone for naught; his slipway is almost obliterated already by the ever-shifting stones. But there is a shapely, appreciable dip in the ridge. So, fetching from a rusty biscuit box the key to a separate section of his compound, he hauls his boat out.
It is battered, but a beauty: an aluminium rowing boat with a brown hull and a bright blue, red and yellow trim, big enough for one man only or two at a squeeze. Inside, it's a bit of a mess of gear and needs a bail-out. But outside he has painted it with scenes from Greek history and mythology, black figures on red, just as they appear on ancient vases. Again he found his references in books, especially Jane Ellen Harrison's ""Prolegomena to Greek Religion"" (1908), which he picked up second-hand in Hove. The siege of Troy is his principal theme. The hull dances with warriors in crested helmets, hunters, Harpies with their bird-bodies and women's heads, wrestlers and lovers. On the starboard side Priam's daughter is sacrificed to the flames; snakehaired Medusa glares from the prow, and on the stern is the motto ""iexye"" (Be Strong): the prayer, he says, of an early Christian martyr as he was thrown to the lions.
He goes back now to fetch a great weight of ropes and five-foot lengths of plastic pipe, and walks off towards the sea. The burden unspools: an extra slipway, joined with ropes, to make a boat-path across the shingle. Again comes the sense of the nuisance of all those pebbles, the inhospitable place. The ropes tangle; painstakingly he unknots them. Then, when all is straight, he walks down the line applying grease to every pipe, to make the journey smoother. Only then will the shingle let him pass.
Like his erstwhile colleagues, he could go off to the marina at the eastern end of town, to a berth by a quay in a maze of modern apartments. It doesn't appeal. The fishing boats seem to be barely tolerated there, crammed in the farthest corner where their pungent, shabby presence will not offend the bronzed weekenders on their yachts. The nets are spread neatly, the crabpots stacked, the ropes properly coiled. His compound, by contrast, celebrates serendipity and sprawl; and he can find anything if he needs to.
Besides, he needs to stay close to guard it. After 15 years of the wire enclosure standing, with perhaps 2,500 beach patrols passing nonchalantly by, the City Council in 2015 ordered him to take it down, because it had been built without consent. As for the sculptures inside it, those too had to be cleared away as a hazard to health and safety. Then things went quiet, and he clung on. Because he is on the static section of the beach, above the high-tide line, he is gloomily aware that he is perching on a big bit of real estate which the council, at any point, might sell. But he hopes, because it is ""very unpredictable"", that it will forget about him.
After all, the shingle causes far bigger headaches. Every year, obedient to the west-east drag of the English Channel, thousands of tonnes of it are worn away from Shoreham Port, six miles west along the coast, and deposited at Kemp Town, at the eastern extremity of the beach by the Western Breakwater. For decades every spring and autumn have seen the ceremony of ""recycling and bypassing"", when-at a cost of around £1m a year-about 10,000 cubic metres of pebbles are scooped from the east and dumped in the west. For around two weeks, loaded lorries drive past Rory's compound and rattle, emptied, back again. Since Shoreham's beach is steadily eroding, and Kemp Town's increasing, there is no reason why this Sisyphean task should ever end; unless either the sea, or the shingle, simply rises to overwhelm everything.
The boat is by the shore. Its prow is in the waves, and he is knocking away with an oar the last pebbles that obstruct it. It will be the only rowing boat among the trawlers, about a mile out, which have already started fishing. But he is in no rush.
He heaves the nets in, then the fish-boxes, then the oars. Next he pulls on waterproof trousers and an orange life-jacket. Then he loops the prow-rope round his shoulders and, like a human ox, pulls the boat farther into the sea. A final push or two from the stern, and he can jump in and start rowing.
His route takes him across the tide, which is unusually flowing east-west today; but the surface is completely calm. He pulls strongly, the boat's only motor, and is soon almost lost to view. A small boat, small as a pebble, in the huge blue sea.

Lying behind the most contentious issues in the Brexit trade talks is a lack of trust
BORIS JOHNSON has often claimed that a story he wrote as a journalist in May 1992 entitled ""Delors plan to rule Europe"" helped swing Danish voters towards a narrow rejection of the European Union's Maastricht treaty. That the article, like much that he wrote about the eu, bore little relationship to the truth has never appeared to trouble him much; yet the suspicions around his character which his coverage of Brussels engendered in the European Commission are now coming back to bite him, for they threaten to undermine his chance of doing a last-minute trade deal with the eu.
Britain's year-long transition out of the eu ends on December 31st, and several deadlines for the two parties to complete a trade deal have already passed. On December 13th Mr Johnson marked another supposedly final deadline by agreeing with Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission's president, that negotiations should continue for an ""extra mile"". This deadline extension raised hopes that the two sides may be shifting from their entrenched positions. Michel Barnier, the eu's chief negotiator, reportedly detected a narrow path to a deal. Yet Mr Johnson insisted that no-deal was still the most likely outcome, and both sides repeated that the gaps over the two toughest issues remained wide.
The highest-profile one is the eu's desire to retain access to British fishing waters. This has prompted hysterical chatter about gunboat diplomacy in the channel. Yet the industry's economic insignificance (it is worth barely 0.1% of gdp) and the fact that both sides sell much of their fish to each other means that fisheries were never likely to be a deal-breaker on their own.
The other big issue, the ""level playing field"" for competition, could be. Right from the start, the eu made clear that granting Britain tariff- and quota-free access to its single market (a more generous deal than Canada's) required measures to guarantee a level playing field for social, environmental, labour and state-subsidy standards. Yet Britain insisted on its sovereign right, as a third country, to diverge from eu rules if it chose. The political declaration appended to the withdrawal treaty duly promised ""robust commitments to ensure a level playing field"". But soon after its ratification, David Frost, Mr Johnson's Brexit negotiator, declared in Brussels that the right to diverge from eu rules was the whole point of the Brexit project. In effect, Mr Johnson's government is saying that the pain and dislocation it will entail is worthwhile in large part because of the future benefits of no longer being bound by the eu's hidebound and inflexible regulations. On the other side the eu sees unfettered access to its single market as a prize that can safely be awarded only to those willing broadly to comply with its rules.
Despite such differences, it should be possible to find a compromise that acknowledges the trade-off that exists between full sovereignty on one side and unfettered access to the single market on the other. Early on Britain conceded the principle of ""non-regression"", meaning a promise not to dilute existing regulatory standards. For its part, the eu backed away from its initial tough negotiating position that Britain must adhere strictly to any future changes to its rules against excessive state subsidies. But differences have persisted over the consequences of future divergence, over a mechanism to settle disputes and over the right of either side to retaliate swiftly if it deems the other to be stealing an unfair competitive advantage.
That's where the trust problem comes in. An agreement over these issues depends on a degree of trust, which is essential for any comprehensive trade deal that relies not just on legal enforcement mechanisms but also on its signatories showing good faith in the commitments they have made. eu leaders believe they have every reason to distrust Mr Johnson, and not just because of his journalistic past. They think the Brexit referendum was won on the back of a campaign of untruths, and their confidence in him has been further undermined by this autumn's saga of the internal-markets bill, in which Mr Johnson proposed unilaterally to amend the Northern Irish provisions that were part of the withdrawal treaty. Although he has now dropped this plan, the damage to the relationship lingers. It was little surprise that Mrs von der Leyen was moved recently to declare that ""trust is good, but law is better"".
Britain is more vulnerable to the consequences of no-deal than is the eu, so if a deal is to be done it is Mr Johnson who will have to make concessions. But he is under pressure from hardliners in his own party not to concede anything on the principle of full sovereignty. And he knows that, even if a trade agreement is struck, disruption will be inevitable. It would be a lot easier to blame this on the malevolent eu if there were no deal than if he had acquiesced to one at the last minute.
Yet business is piling pressure on the government to avoid no-deal, which would mean not just disruption (see next story) and broken supply chains but also tariffs that could bankrupt farmers and carmakers (who would be subject to tariffs of up to 40% and 10% respectively) and send unemployment rocketing. The distance between the two sides remains considerable and the path narrow. But the smart money is on Mr Johnson conceding just enough over retaliation under the level-playing-field provisions to secure a deal."

To minimise disruption, rules will be waived. Good times ahead for smugglers
SINCE THE European Union's single market took effect in 1992, goods have flowed freely across Britain's border with the eu without the suite of checks normally carried out at a country's frontier. When Britain leaves the union at 11pm on December 31st, this arrangement will end. Pol Sweeney of Descartes, a supply-chain technology company, estimates that Britain's departure will create a requirement to inspect a volume of goods some five to ten times larger than are checked at present. Those checks will be required with or without a deal, but will have to be more detailed if no agreement is in place.
Such a sharp increase threatens to overwhelm British ports' infrastructure. Three decades of freedom mean that most of Britain's trade with the eu now takes place via ""roll-on-roll-off"" ferry ports, many of which, because they have never needed it, have no space to carry out newly required physical checks. In preparation, lorry parks have been built around the port of Dover, which accounts for 69% of all goods-vehicle movement between Britain and the eu. The tax office, hmrc, is building a new computer system, the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, to try to minimise disruption. In principle, instead of stopping lorries at the border to inspect their contents, the system allows for checks to be done digitally while they are on the move. The system is not finished, with Britain's departure days away.
Britain has already said it will fudge its own enforcement on inbound goods for the first six months of 2021, a hedge against disruption. So, barring perhaps protest and other unpredictable outcomes that may arise in the event of no deal, there will be few changes for trade coming into Britain from the eu. A freshly Brexited Britain has the autonomy to continue that situation as long as it needs in the name of minimising disruption, although Mark Clough of Dentons, a law firm, notes that such leniency will probably violate World Trade Organisation rules. Mr Clough says Britain's view appears to be that by the time any country complains about the lax treatment eu imports are receiving, it will have sorted out any problems and be operating under the rules. Tony McDonach of Hill Dickinson, a maritime law firm, calls the proposal to wave through goods in the name of minimising disruption a ""smuggler's charter"".
Goods moving from Britain to Europe are more vulnerable. France, Belgium and the Netherlands, the European countries into which British goods primarily flow, do not have Britain's freedom to fudge. As eu members they are all bound by the Union Customs Code, which means, says Brian Mulier of Bird and Bird, a law firm, that 4% of all goods must be physically inspected. Europe's Court of Auditors will be hovering over the proceedings to ensure that eu rules are followed. If Kent's lorry parks fill up with outbound vehicles, backed up from the point where they gain entry to the eu, that may have a knock-on effect on inbound traffic, for European hauliers may refuse to take goods into Britain for fear of getting embroiled in the mess.
EU states already have some flexibility on the application of tariffs on pandemic-related supplies, as well as the power to suspend duties in the name of disaster relief. Given that existing flexibility, if disaster looms post-Brexit, Mr Clough sees no reason why the European countries might not also wave goods through to avert a crisis. Sadly for residents of Kent, the Garden of England's transformation into a lorry park is unlikely to count."

Heathrow is allowed to build a third runway, but may no longer need one
THE SAGA of the potential third runway at Heathrow, Britain's largest airport, has been called the longest take-off in history. A commission in 1993 recommended expansion, and the government first endorsed the plan in 2003. But it was not until 2018 that the transport secretary finally gave the project the go-ahead. A Court of Appeal ruling in February 2020 that the runway was not compatible with Britain's obligations under the Paris climate agreement of 2015 appeared to have finally scuppered the plans. But on December 16th the Supreme Court overturned that judgment and once more green-lit the project.
The initial Court of Appeal judgment found that the government's decision to allow the expansion to go ahead was unlawful because Chris Grayling, then transport secretary, had failed to take the Paris agreement into account. While that was a blow to Heathrow, it helped get Boris Johnson's government out of a tight spot. Mr Johnson, whose own constituency is near the airport, has been a fierce critic of the expansion plans, famously pledging to protesters that he would ""lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and...stop the construction"". The government chose not to appeal, but Heathrow did; and the Supreme Court decided that the government had taken Paris into account, and the Court of Appeal was therefore wrong.
Even so, the expansion may not go ahead. While the airline industry has long championed a third runway, much has changed since February 2020. British Airways, Heathrow's largest customer, has become sceptical about the plans. Earlier this year Willie Walsh, the chief executive of ba's parent company, argued that ""it was a Herculean task before covid and I think it's impossible now"". Although air travel will almost certainly rebound as social-distancing restrictions are eased in 2021, the industry is not expecting a quick recovery. The International Air Travel Association, a lobby group, expects that global spending on air travel will be about half of 2019 levels in 2021. Short-haul flights from Britain are expected to rise sharply as the vaccine is rolled out and consumers dash off to sunnier climes, but the outlook for longerhaul flights remains highly uncertain.
Analysts reckon the big unknown is the future of business travel. Firms that have grown accustomed to Zoom meetings may well be less keen to splash out on highpriced tickets from London to New York. Although business flyers account for only around 10% of transatlantic custom they pay ten to 12 times as much per ticket as economy passengers. A substantial fall in their numbers would mean large rises in ticket prices for the rest, which in turn would dent demand. If long-haul flight volumes remain depressed, then the business case for a third runway at Heathrow starts to look ropy. Boris Johnson is unlikely to have to prostrate himself in front of those bulldozers soon, if ever."

Politicians are competing in an animal-welfare arms race
MICHAEL JACKSON had Bubbles, a chimpanzee. Justin Bieber had og Mally, a capuchin, until it was seized by German customs officials and put in a zoo. Rihanna has been photographed bottle-feeding a baby monkey on holiday. The trio of stars would find few fans in the British government, which on December 12th proposed new restrictions on keeping primates as pets. Somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 marmosets, lemurs, tamarins and other little species are kept in private ownership in Britain, the government reckons, often bored to misery.
One of the benefits of cutting loose from the horse-eating continent is that Britain can give full rein to its passion for animals. Politicians are only too happy to oblige, for pet-friendly policies are cheap and popular. In last year's election, the Tories promised to help councils reunite strays with their owners by making it mandatory to microchip cats and to tackle puppy-smuggling. (Sir Roger Gale, an mp, says bootleggers should have their cars crushed at Dover and be made to walk home.) It will end the live export of farm animals, a symbol for eurosceptics of eu inflexibility. Labour promised to ban the live-boiling of lobsters in restaurants, and to review the use of whips by racing jockeys.
Yet Britain's animal-welfare laws are already among the most comprehensive in the world, according to the Animal Protection Index, a league table. The Animal Welfare Act of 2006, which imposed obligations on keepers to properly feed, house and stimulate animals, and to protect them from pain, disease and suffering, could be used to tackle monkey-keeping. The government is increasing the maximum penalty for abuse to five years in prison. But new laws offer more political mileage.
Wild animals in travelling circuses were banned by law last year, but a dwindling public appetite for parades of elephants and tigers balanced on stools had already put an end to the business. By the time the ban was imposed, only two licensed animal circuses were left in Britain, comprising a sad menagerie of six reindeer, four camels, four zebras, two racoons, a zebu, a macaw and a fox.
Private members' bills are popular vehicles for pro-pet signalling. A bill proposed by Bill Wiggin, a Tory mp, last year would have criminalised the eating of dog meat. Selling dog meat is already illegal. Mr Wiggin conceded there was ""no evidence"" that people eat dogs in Britain, but said it would set a good example to China, where they do.
MPS are moved by the traumatic loss of pets to motor accidents. James Daly, the Tory mp for the ultra-marginal seat of Bury North, has proposed ""Gizmo's Law"", named after a constituent's cat, the victim of a hitand-run accident, which was cremated without its owner's knowledge. The law would oblige councils that retrieve dead animals from the roadside to scan them for microchips, so that they can be reunited with their grieving owners rather than being anonymously incinerated. A draft bill in 2018 proposed criminalising drivers who failed to stop after striking a cat. (Hit-andruns on dogs, pigs, goats and humans are already illegal.)
One of the most popular proposals, judging by two petitions to Parliament which have secured more than 250,000 signatures between them, is a new offence of pet theft, which would recognise that for owners, dognapping feels more like the abduction of a child than the purloining of a television. Stealing a pet is already punishable by up to seven years in prison under the Theft Act, and judges can already account for the emotional distress when passing sentence. Still, it could be just the thing for the next manifesto."

A british Christmas is inseparable not just from a jolly fat man in a red suit but also from a grumpy, thin ""squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner"". Charles Dickens's novella ""A Christmas Carol"" was an instant hit. Within two months of its publication in 1843 there were 12 adaptations on the London stage. Nearly two centuries on, its anti-hero retains his hold on the popular imagination. The internet offers a dancing Scrooge, a singing Scrooge, a woke Scrooge, a Scrooge with Muppets, and a Scrooge with Freudian ""daddy issues"".
By all means enjoy ""A Christmas Carol"" in this season-better read aloud to the children, in Victorian fashion, than on the screen. William Thackeray, Dickens's contemporary and rival, described it as a ""national benefit and, to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness"". But don't stop there: Dickens is an inexhaustible source of pleasure and instruction all year round. He was, after Shakespeare, Britain's most creative generator of characters, with more than a thousand listed in Wikipedia. That they are as relevant today as they were in his time is testament not only to his ability to capture essential human traits but also to the parallels between the Victorian age and ours.
So many Dickens characters summon up the peculiar spirit of 2020 that it is hard to choose between them. In ""Bleak House"", Old Krook spontaneously combusts, which feels like a fitting end to the year. In ""Hard Times"", Mr Gradgrind tries to ""weigh and measure any parcel of human nature"", neatly encapsulating modern officialdom's obsession with targets and algorithms. In ""Little Dorrit"", the Barnacle family controls the business of the Circumlocution Office much as well-connected Tories enjoy the benefits of government outsourcing today. But three characters tower over their rivals as embodiments of 2020.
John Podsnap, from ""Our Mutual Friend"", is Brexit Britain made flesh. A pompous philistine of the narrowest kind-""particularly well satisfied with most things, and, above all other things, with himself""-he considers other countries ""a mistake"", foreigners ""unfortunately born"", and the British constitution the best in the world, ""bestowed upon us by providence"". In sum, ""no other country"" is as ""favoured as this country"".
Podsnap's views reverberate around the Tory world. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, told a radio audience that, among various nations under discussion, Britain is ""a much better country than every single one of them"". Its speed in licensing the covid-19 vaccine was, he said, evidence that ""we've got the very best people in this country and we've obviously got the best medical regulators"". It was Podsnappery that led Michael Gove to claim that Britain would ""hold all the cards"" when it left the European Union, and Podsnappery that persuaded Liam Fox that a trade deal with the eu should be ""the easiest in human history"".
If Podsnap personifies nationalistic complacency, Madame Defarge in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" embodies revolutionary fervour, with her compelling mix of the monstrous and the mundane. She runs a wine shop while plotting against her enemies, and knits while watching one aristocrat after another going to the guillotine. Her victims' individual humanity means nothing to her; they are mere representatives of a system that must be destroyed. ""She saw not him but them,"" as Dickens puts it. The knitting is more than an idle distraction from the work of vengeance. She knits the names of her victims in an act of revolutionary piety.
Today's culture wars reprise these themes. Vengeance-obsessed revolutionaries dehumanise their opponents by hounding them off the stage in public meetings (""deplatforming"") or mobbing them on social media (""cancelling""). They get people sacked from their jobs, often rendering them unemployable, for digressions from an ever-changing orthodoxy. A veteran columnist, Suzanne Moore, left the Guardian newspaper because of a furore about an article she wrote on women and trans rights. An Oxford historian, Selina Todd, was disinvited from giving a lecture and forced to hire security guards because she offended some activists. People stay silent about newly sensitive issues because they fear the sound of today's equivalent of Madame Defarge's knitting needles clicking away as the professional guillotine comes down on their necks.
And what about Scrooge himself? It is unfortunate that, in portraying this upstanding citizen, Dickens allowed his most irritating vice, sentimentality, to get the better of him. ""A Christmas Carol"" degenerates. In its feelgood ending, a reformed Scrooge makes amends to those he has wronged and sucks up to all and sundry. Before his lamentable decline, however, he is one of the wisest figures in literature, blessed with a great insight: that the world is addicted to humbug. This powerful perception is even truer now than it was in the 1840s.
Today almost everything is the opposite of what it pretends to be. Companies claim that they are devoted to advancing gay rights, promoting multiculturalism or uniting the world in a Kumbaya sing-along, when they are in fact singlemindedly maximising profits. Chief executives claim that they are ever-so-humble ""team leaders""-in homage to another great Dickens invention, the unctuous Uriah Heep-when they are actually creaming off an unprecedented share of corporate cash. Private schools such as Eton claim that they are in the business of promoting ""diversity"" and ""inclusivity"" even as they charge £42,000 a year. Future historians seeking to sum up our era may well call it ""the age of humbug"".
Whether the purveyors of this sanctimonious guff actually believe it, or whether it is cynical doublespeak, is immaterial. Either way, spin doctors, sycophants and so-called thought leaders pump noxious quantities of it into the atmosphere. The nation is in desperate need of a modern-day Dickens to clear the air. Until one emerges, Britons should repeat his great creation's Christmas mantra in every season: ""Bah, humbug!"" *"

ROME
Even the pontiff faces the pinch of the pandemic
As nativity scenes go, the one in St Peter's Square unveiled on December 11th is a startling departure from tradition. Several of the 54 giant ceramic figures would not look out of place on a Star Wars set. ""Ugly and demonic-looking,"" one appalled Catholic called them on Twitter. But the crib, apparently inspired by Greek, Egyptian and Sumerian art, is of a piece with a year that has been as exceptional for Europe's smallest state and its ruler, Pope Francis, as for the rest of the world.
Like most other countries, the Vatican City State will end 2020 with its public finances in a precarious condition. Just how precarious is hard to know, since the latest figures date from 2015 when it had a budget surplus of almost €6om ($73m). But what is known is that the city-state depends largely on revenues from the Vatican Museums to stay in the black. The Catholic News Agency rcently estimated that ticket sales alone bring in just over €ioom. And, because of the pandemic, the museums have been closed for months. Even when they have been open, because of restrictions on the number of visitors and the scarcity of tourists in Rome, they have sold far fewer tickets than normal.
All this means that the city-state could well end up with a deficit of €15m or more for 2020. And unlike its bigger neighbours, it does not issue bonds to cover its debts. Nor can it rely on the eu to bail it out. But it doubtless has reserves.
The city-state's surpluses have till now been used to help fund the spending of the other half of the Vatican: the Holy See, the central administration of the world's biggest Christian church. Even after contributions from the city-state's governorate, a dividend from the Vatican Bank and donations from the faithful, the Holy See ended 2019 €iim in the red. The Vatican's ""finance minister"", the prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, Father Juan Antonio Guerrero Alves, said that, had it not been for extraordinary items, the deficit would have been twice as big.
The Holy See can count on a much increased dividend from the Vatican Bank, which made a profit of €38m in 2019. But, in reaction to the pandemic, Pope Francis has halved the rent on the properties that the Holy See owns and on which it depends for about a third of its revenue. It will also have lost much of its income from commercial activities, such as the sale of publications. And contributions from the Catholic church's dioceses are likely to be lower too, since fewer worshippers have been able to attend church services. Il Sole-24 Ore, a financial daily, reported in June that the Holy See was bracing itself for a €53m deficit. With Italy now in the grip of a second wave of infection, that could prove to be an underestimate.
The Vatican's financial difficulties are entangled with two other interconnected issues awaiting Francis in 2021, a year in which he will undertake a potentially hazardous visit to Iraq. The first is the outcome of a judicial investigation into a deal worth €200m involving the purchase of a property in London. Prosecutors are investigating whether the Holy See was swindled. The second is a report on the Vatican's finances by Moneyval, the European anti-moneylaundering watchdog, expected in April.
Though the investigation, which has dragged on for 14 months without charges being laid, appears to show a determination to clamp down on anything that might give rise to suspicions of jiggery-pokery in the Vatican's notoriously opaque financial dealings, it has also cast doubt on the papacy's capacity to regulate them. It has prompted the removal of the director of the Vatican's financial regulator, who denies any wrongdoing, and turned the spotlight on a third, hitherto virtually unknown sphere of financial activity. This consists of funds running to hundreds of millions of euros that are managed by individual Vatican departments. (The property in London was bought not by the papacy's sovereignwealth fund, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, or apsa, but by the Secretariat of State, which combines the roles of a foreign and interior ministry.)
Management of the secretariat's pot of gold has since been transferred to apsa, but the confusion and secrecy that still envelope the Vatican's finances are symptomatic of an administration that is in many respects highly efficient, yet patently in need of modernisation more than 50 years after the last big reform, under Paul VI.
Francis was elected in 2013 as the candidate of cardinals who were urging a shake-up of the Holy See. One of his earliest moves was to delegate the job to a council of advisers drawn mostly from outside Rome and notably short on Vatican bigwigs-a sign of his preference for decentralising the church's bureaucracy. That alone made him deeply suspect to many in the Holy See and is part of the explanation for a resistance to Francis's papacy that often manifests itself as opposition to his theological ideas.
After seven years of effort, the pontiff's advisers are currently working on the final draft that is expected to form the basis in 2021 for an Apostolic Constitution, the most solemn kind of papal edict. Its promulgation is likely to be the high point of the Vatican's year. A draft of the edict that was circulated in Rome and sent to national bishops' conferences in 2019 would diminish the status of the Vatican's feared doctrinal enforcement body, once known as the Holy Office. Revolutionary? Certainly. But perhaps the message of those bizarre figures in St Peter's Square this Christmas is that, under Pope Francis, nothing should be taken for granted. *"

BERLIN
The eu gives itself a weapon to contest rule-of-law violations. Will it use it?
Angela merkel, Germany's chancellor, has long applied two operating principles in Europe: to keep the club united, and to postpone resolving crises until the last possible moment. Both were evident in an eleventh-hour deal struck on December 10th in Brussels between the European Union's 27 heads of government. With a fiscal crunch looming, the leaders at last gave the green light to a seven-year eu budget worth €1.1trn ($1.3trn) as well as a one-off €750bn fund, financed by joint borrowing, to speed recovery from the covid-19 crisis.
The sticking-point was a problem that has long bedevilled the eu: how to tackle corruption and other skulduggery in countries that benefit from eu transfers. At a gruelling four-day summit in July, the leaders backed the principle of attaching ruleof-law conditions to the vast eu spending they had approved. But Hungary and Poland, unhappy with the proposed legal regulations that followed in November, threatened to veto both the budget and the recovery fund. (Both countries are already facing eu rule-of-law probes over their government's interference with national judiciaries and other matters.)
Faced with drastic cuts that would have applied had the eu begun 2021 without a budget in place, the European Commission considered the radical step of rebuilding the recovery fund outside eu structures, excluding the hold-outs. That threat, say diplomats, concentrated minds in Warsaw and Budapest. In a late flurry of diplomacy the German government, which holds the rotating presidency of the eu Council, issued a supplementary proposal. Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, flew to Poland to persuade his allies to sign on. Satisfied with Mrs Merkel's work, the rest of the eu assented in Brussels.
Under the German proposal, the text of the rule-of-law regulation remains untouched. That enables the European Commission to block disbursements of eu money, including from the recovery fund, if it suspects recipient governments of corruption or other foul play, so long as a qualified majority of eu governments agree. That could pose a threat to the system of authoritarian cronyism Mr Orban has assembled on the back of eu funds amounting to around 3% of annual gdp. Poland's system is cleaner but, notes Piotr Buras at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Warsaw, the government's court-stacking could fall foul of the regulation's references to judicial independence, if the commission thinks it interferes with the management of eu funds.
The biggest concession to the hold-outs was an agreement that no action would be taken under the mechanism until the Eu's top court had ruled on its legality, a process that could take up to two years (but which is likely to be accelerated). Critics, such as George Soros, a financier and Mr Orban's bete noire, see this and smaller concessions as a sell-out to the rogues. Indeed, after the summit Mr Orban declared victory with typical bombast. But both his and Poland's government had vowed to see off the regulation. Their failure even to water it down shows where the burden of compromise really fell. Poland's hardline justice minister, who said the deal violated the constitution, even threatened to bring down his government, before backing down.
The Eu's previous attempts to tackle rule-of-law abuses in member states have signally failed. This one may have teeth- should the eu decide to apply them. That remains an open question: wary of shunting governments into an outer orbit, Mrs Merkel has long proved tolerant of Hungarian and, more recently, Polish excesses. (Mr Orban's Fidesz party sits with the chancellor's in the European Parliament.) That instinct remains intact, as her scramble to conclude Germany's presidency with a budget deal demonstrates. Yet other politicians who have built careers opposing chicanery and money-grubbing are cautiously optimistic. Slovakia's president, Zuzana Caputova, who was elected on a rule-of-law ticket in 2019, says she is glad that the principle is now legally binding at eu level. But, she adds, ""having the mechanism to defend the rule of law in place is just the first step. Now we need to make it work."" *"

BAKU
It will be hard to soften the hatred between Azeris and Armenians
There is plenty of farmland in Fuzuli, one of Azerbaijan's districts that ring the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. But there is nothing to harvest. Where wheat and grapes once grew, unexploded rockets sprout from the ground at odd angles, reminders of the vicious fighting that tore through the area in the autumn. The charred hulks of tanks remain. A cratered road snakes through a wasteland of villages and towns abandoned after an earlier bout of violence three decades ago. Thousands of landmines lurk underground.
Farther north in Agdam, once an Azeri city of 40,000 people, Aide Huseynova, a pensioner, snaps photos of a ruined 19thcentury mosque. She escaped from Agdam in 1993, during the first Nagorno-Karabakh war, fleeing before an Armenian offensive. About 1m people, most of them Azeris, were displaced in the fighting. Now, for the first time since then, she is back. Yet there is nothing left for her to see, bar a sea of rubble and crumbling walls that stretches for miles in every direction, looking like the aftermath of a nuclear attack. The mosque is the only building left standing. ""My heart aches,"" says Mrs Huseynova. ""I don't want to see it at all.""
In a campaign that lasted over six weeks and ended with a ceasefire on November 9th, Azerbaijan recovered the seven districts, including Fuzuli and Agdam, that Armenian forces had occupied since the 1990s. (Most of Nagorno-Karabakh, still populated almost exclusively by Armenians, remains in the separatists' hands.) At least 5,000 people were killed in the recent fighting. Human-rights groups have called on both sides to investigate reports of war crimes, including videos that appear to show executions and other atrocities committed by Azerbaijani troops.
The devastation inflicted on Azeri towns during the 27 years under Armenian control will be hard to undo. The Armenian separatists who ran Nagorno-Karabakh used the districts once occupied by Azeris as a buffer zone and a future bargaining chip, making many of them uninhabitable. Buildings were bulldozed. Looters took anything the former residents had left behind. Some put the cost of reviving these ghost cities at as much as $15bn, though Azerbaijan's government has yet to make an estimate. It could take seven years to demine the districts, says Hikmet Hajiyev, an aide of Azerbaijan's president.
Many Azeri refugees from the disputed enclave are destitute, while Azerbaijan's upper class prospers because of plentiful oil. In a shabby block of flats on the edge of Baku, the capital, Aliyev Karim Hasimoglu, a former metal-worker from Fuzuli, shares a single room with four relations. He says he wants to live long enough to rebury a brother, who died in the first Karabakh war, in their ancestral village. He has spent the past 25 years in the same room; 20 other refugee families live on the same floor. Three communal bathrooms serve about 100 people. Paint peels from the walls, pipes leak and cigarette butts litter the staircases. Mr Hajiyev says his government spends $1bn a year on the refugees, but many say that is not enough.
Mrs Huseynova says she had Armenian neighbours before the war, but would curse them if she saw them again. ""As an Azerbaijan citizen from Agdam, I don't want to live next to them."" *"

Why Balkan doctors emigrate
Health-care systems everywhere are buckling because of covid-19. In southeast Europe, rising infection rates are hammering systems that were already rundown. Balkan doctors and nurses have been emigrating for years. The main reason is that conditions at home are poor. Pay is low, graft is rife and hospitals are often run by venal political appointees. Jobs in western Europe seem cushy by comparison.
In Bucharest, Romania's capital, 27 people died when a nightclub caught fire in 2015, but four months later the toll had risen to 64. Many had been killed by hospital infections attributable to corruption. Disinfectants had been so diluted that they had virtually turned to water. In a new documentary about the scandal, Vlad Voiculescu, briefly Romania's minister of health, says that since taking the top job he has realised that everything underneath him ""is rotten...corrupt, demotivated. They don't give a fuck about anything out there.""
One consequence is that nearly 5,000 Romanians now work for England's National Health Service. But Mr Voiculescu could have been speaking for the entire region. In 2019 there were 50,000 citizens of the six non-EU Balkan countries working in Germany's health-care system, twothirds of them Bosnians and Serbs. In spring, when the pandemic struck and borders closed, Austria laid on special transport to bring in hundreds of Bulgarian, Croatian and Romanian health workers.
Balkan tabloids sometimes claim there will soon be no more doctors and nurses left in their countries. But the story is not as simple as that. Romania actually has 21% more doctors than it did a decade ago, while in Bulgaria the numbers are stable. Since 2013 almost 6,000 Bosnian nurses have gone to work in Germany on just one official scheme, yet more than 7,500 nurses back home are unemployed.
In the past few decades more people in the Balkans have been studying medicine than ever before, not least because it is a good way to land a well-paid job abroad. There are not enough jobs for those who stay behind, however, and those that exist are often unattractive. In Romania few doctors want to work in remote regions or be general practitioners, who are badly paid.
Some local medical training is poor. Serbian colleges churn out nurses with patchy knowledge. Gorica Djokic, a leader of Serbia's doctors' union, says that some who ""can't tell if a patient is asleep or in a coma"" are employed in hospitals to make up for those who have gone abroad. As for doctors, she identifies two problems that are common across the region. Those most likely to emigrate do so at the beginning of their careers or are sought-after specialists. The average age of doctors who stay in Serbia, she says, is 55.
To stanch the flow of emigrants, health services have raised doctors' wages. In Romania they have tripled in the past few years. Alexandru Radu, aged 22, is a fourthyear medical student. When he thought he would be paid only a couple of hundred euros a month in his first job, he ""100%"" planned to go abroad. Now, with a chance to earn €1,000 a month in his home country when he graduates, he says: ""I really want to stay here."" *"

SQUINT A LITTLE, and Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen look rather alike. The British prime minister and the president of the European Commission were both children of Eurocrats, partly brought up in Brussels. Both were written off in domestic politics, only to be catapulted into the biggest jobs of their lives. Both have enough children to fill a minibus.
Open your eyes fully, however, and the differences become clear. Whereas Mrs von der Leyen speaks like a technocrat, Mr Johnson speaks like a bloke telling jokes in a pub. Mrs von der Leyen is overseeing a much-needed deepening of the eu. Under Mr Johnson, Britain has left it. Mrs von der Leyen boasts of her seven children; Mr Johnson refuses to specify how many he has (Wikipedia opts for ""at least six"").
The political traditions from which the two leaders come are also less alike than you might expect. Mr Johnson is a Conservative; Mrs von der Leyen is a Christian Democrat. These two philosophies have much in common. They both sit on the centre-right as natural parties of government, with reputations for fiscal prudence. Their ideologies are mushy. Each abhors big thinkers: there is no equivalent of Marx or Mill when it comes to either outlook. Pragmatism is a point of pride for both; generally, keeping lefties out of power-or at least constrained-is enough of a purpose. But it is their differences that help explain why Britain never sat easily in the bloc.
After all, the eu was a Christian Democratic invention. Its founding fathers-Alcide De Gasperi of Italy, Konrad Adenauer of Germany and Robert Schuman of France-were Christian Democrats, as were all six foreign ministers who signed its original treaties. Although no longer hegemonic, Christian Democratic parties still shape the eu. They bestride the European People's Party (epp), the group of centre-right parties, which carves up eu jobs, such as Mrs von der Leyen's. Angela Merkel, Germany's Christian Democratic Union chancellor, is comfortably the continent's most powerful politician. Christian Democrats built Europe and they still, more or less, run it. To understand Europe, one must understand Christian Democracy. Unfortunately for Britain, the Conservatives-their closest cousins across the Channel-never have.
Sometimes these misunderstandings resulted in strategic errors. When running for the leadership of the Conservatives, David Cameron pledged to leave the epp, the club of the mainstream right. For Mr Cameron, it was a simple decision. In general, the Christian Democrats who dominated the group wanted more European integration, whereas Mr Cameron and his Conservative party did not. The promise was meat for a hungry Eurosceptic membership, and helped Mr Cameron win. But to Mrs Merkel, it was an insult. The epp was a broad church with a deeper purpose that has dominated Christian Democracy: to stop the socialists from running the show. Quitting was akin to desertion.
Individualism is either a goal or a horror, depending on whether one is speaking to a Conservative or a Christian Democrat. Margaret Thatcher once declared that there is ""no such thing as society"", only individuals and families. Jacques Maritain, one of the few examples of a Christian Democratic political philosopher, put rampant individualism in the same breath as totalitarianism, suggesting that any form of Christian Democracy must be ""opposed to both the idea of the totalitarian state and the sovereignty of the individual"". In this view, there is nothing but society.
Even the preferred methods of politics clash. The slow, grinding consensus-building at the heart of Christian Democracy and consequently the eu itself is anathema to Conservatives, for whom the term sounds too much like capitulation. Compared with the winner-takes-all system of British politics, the workings of the eu seem slow and unresponsive to Conservative eyes and just the ticket to Christian Democrat ones. ""Merkel is not a Thatcher,"" wrote Mr Cameron in his autobiography, not altogether approvingly. ""Her favourite expression is 'step by step'."" By contrast, the Conservative Party has a distinctly unconservative lust for creative destruction. Brexit, a project that radically overhauls the state, is simply the latest example. Rather than proceeding step by step, Brexit means taking a giant leap. Even the presentation of these policies is different. Dullness is a virtue for Christian Democrats. For Conservatives, it is a sin. Angela Merkel is far from the first Christian Democrat leader to revel in anti-charisma. For Mr Johnson, charisma is his main weapon.
Not just the narcissism of small differences
The fundamental split in the Christian Democratic and Conservative worldview has dogged Brexit negotiations. Ultimately, Brexit is a project that puts the nation-state back at the centre of politics. By contrast, Christian Democracy is built on deep suspicion of it. Partly this stems from an analysis of the 20th century as either the triumph of the nation-state (the British view) or its tragedy (that of much of western Europe). In the Christian Democratic worldview, power should be diffuse, spread across local, regional and national levels. Adding another layer in the form of Europe was no big deal. ""It was easy to give up parts of what was feared in the first place,"" writes Jan-Werner Mueller of Princeton University. To Conservatives, however, a supranational layer of authority was an affront.
Arguments over ""level playing-field"" arrangements in Brexit may seem like technical wrangling. In fact, they are a clash between the Conservative and Christian Democratic view of the state. Conservatives want power yanked back; Christian Democrats struggle to understand why. Mutual incomprehension is a poor basis for a relationship. Yet that was the foundation of Britain's relationship with the eu : the dominant ideology of both polities was unable to understand the other side. Like Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen, Britain and its eu peers may look similar, but they are far from the same. Unless you squint."

CONYERS AND HARTWELL
Control of the Senate, and Donald Trump's future, hang in the balance in Georgia
COVID-19 HAS led to many innovations. In America one has been the drive-in political rally. On December 5th the two Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, held one such event in Rockdale County, a fast-growing suburb of Atlanta where Joe Biden won almost 70% of the vote. Most of those attending listened to the speeches from their cars, honking enthusiastically rather than clapping. Despite the protection of their windscreens, almost everyone in the multiracial crowd wore masks. The candidates discussed health care, jobs, justice and, of course, what to do about the virus.
Republicans have not embraced this innovation. Four days later David Perdue, Mr Ossoff's Republican opponent, held his event in Hartwell, the seat of a small rural county on the South Carolina border where Donald Trump won almost 75% of the vote. Mr Perdue's rally was indoors, and although most of the crowd was elderly and covid-19 has ravaged the county, few wore masks. The crowd, which was entirely white, sat quietly as Mr Perdue warned that he was the bulwark against Democrats controlling government and implementing a ""socialist agenda"" that included ""open borders"" and ""defund[ing] the police"".
In November, Mr Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. On December 14th, after a month of ever more ludicrous lawsuits by Mr Trump's allies, the electoral college confirmed Mr Biden's victory nationwide. But his ability to govern effectively hinges on the state's two Senate seats. Both are up for grabs on January 5th in two run-off elections, which Georgia holds when no candidate reaches 50% in the first round. If the Democrats can win both, they will have 50 Senate seats-enough, with the vice-president as the tie-breaker, to hold a majority.
In November Mr Perdue, first elected to the Senate six years ago, fell 0.3% short, but still finished nearly two points ahead of Mr Ossoff. In the other race-a special election to fill two years remaining in the term of Johnny Isakson, who retired for health reasons-Mr Warnock finished top of a crowded pack, but with just 32.9%. He faces Kelly Loeffler, appointed by Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, in December 2019, who came top out of six Republicans. Early voting began on December 14th.
In both races, one candidate is clearly stronger. In the main election Mr Perdue has the advantages of incumbency, staunch loyalty to Mr Trump, a folksy manner and a famous name-his cousin Sonny was Georgia's first Republican governor since Reconstruction. He is the only one of the four candidates who has ever won a general election. Mr Ossoff is a rousing speaker, but he often sounds like a Barack Obama impersonator. He runs a media firm and, at the age of just 30, ran unsuccessfully for Congress three years ago.
In the special election, by contrast, it is Mr Warnock who has the more compelling story. Brought up in public housing in Savannah, he earned a doctorate in theology, and in 2005 became the youngest-ever senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King junior and senior preached. Decades in the pulpit have made him practised on the stump, whereas his opponent, Ms Loeffler, is awkward, robotic even. She has spent the campaign attacking Mr Warnock as a ""radical liberal"" (a phrase she repeated at least a dozen times during a debate on December 6th).
Polls show that both races are tight. But Democrats like their chances. Atlanta and its surrounding area have been growing- thanks in part to migration, particularly of African-American professionals, from other parts of America-as Georgia's more conservative rural population has declined. Activists led by Stacey Abrams, the former state House minority leader, have spent the past decade registering young and non-white voters.
And the Republicans are at each other's throats. Mr Trump reckons Mr Kemp is a ""fool"" who let the election be stolen. Ms Loeffler and Mr Perdue have called on the Republican secretary of state to resign, apparently for not throwing out the vote. Two hard-right lawyers, Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, have been urging Trump supporters not to ""vote in another rigged election"" on ""another machine made by China"". If some of Mr Trump's most enthusiastic supporters stay away, it will hurt Mr Perdue's and Ms Loeffler's chances.
The two also face scandals of their own. Both have been investigated by the Justice Department over allegations that they profited from insider information gleaned from congressional briefings (neither was charged and both deny wrongdoing).
Yet it may not be enough for the Democrats. Republicans rarely lose run-off races, because Democrats are less likely to turn out in non-presidential elections than Republicans. Though he failed to break 50%, Mr Perdue got a slightly higher share of the vote than Mr Trump in November. The combined share of the Republicans in Ms Loeffler's race was only slightly lower. Messrs Ossoff and Warnock have been pitching their victories as essential to Mr Biden's success. But that will succeed only if a critical mass of the suburban voters who propelled Mr Biden to victory are now reliable Democrats who want to see his agenda enacted, rather than Republicans who voted against Mr Trump but would prefer divided government.
As well as control of the Senate, the outcome may determine Mr Trump's status in the Republican Party. Both Republicans have stuck fast to the president despite his loss, and in defiance of the state's other elected Republican officials. If they win, it will show the enduring appeal of Trumpism to Republican voters. A win for two unabashedly progressive Democrats, however-particularly if Republicans cannot win back some suburban voters-will show Trumpism's limits and usher its progenitor out of office, having lost and endorsed a pair of losers. Motivation, then, for both parties."

Hackers have vaulted into the heart of America's government
On september 25TH Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, warned that a ""largescale confrontation in the digital sphere"" was looming. He offered a solution. Russia and America would ""exchange guarantees of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, including electoral processes, including using ict""-in short, a cybertruce. Even as he spoke, his hackers were apparently deep inside some of America's most sensitive networks.
American officials claim that a group of hackers known as APT29, or more evocatively as Cozy Bear, thought to be part of the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service, penetrated several American government bodies-the list so far includes the Treasury, Commerce, State and Homeland Security Departments, along with the National Institutes of Health-where they could read emails at will. It appears to be one of the largest-ever acts of digital espionage against America.
The intrusion took a circuitous route. Between March and June, SolarWinds, a Texan company, pushed out updates to its Orion software, which is widely used to ? help organisations monitor their networks. The malware hitched a ride on those updates. Once downloaded, it allowed hackers to impersonate an organisation's system administrators, who typically have the run of the entire network. It cleverly funnelled out data by disguising it as legitimate traffic while parrying anti-virus tools. Once inside, intruders can remain present even if Orion is disconnected.
The campaign showed ""top-tier operational tradecraft"", says FireEye, a cyber-security firm that was itself a victim. Orion's ubiquity explains why so many organisations were affected. SolarWinds says that ""fewer than 18,000"" customers may have been struck, though most would have been collateral damage.
America's ability to muster a response is unlikely to be helped by President Donald Trump's dismissal, on November 17th, of Chris Krebs, the head of the Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency (cisa), for publicly affirming the integrity of the presidential election. cisa has struggled to cope with the onslaught.
Over the past decade, America has tended to categorise and respond to cyber-attacks according to their aims. It regarded intrusions intended to steal secrets-in other words, old-fashioned espionage-as fair game, not least because its own National Security Agency (nsa) is a prolific thief. After China stole 22m security-clearance records from America's Office of Personnel Management (opm) in 2015, Michael Hayden, a former nsa chief, conceded that it was ""honourable espionage work"". In contrast, attacks intended to cause harm, like North Korea's assault on Sony Pictures in 2014, or those with commercial aims, like China's theft of industrial secrets, were thought to cross a line. America has accordingly indicted and imposed sanctions on scores of Russian, Chinese, North Korean and Iranian hackers.
Yet this effort to stamp norms onto a covert and chaotic arena of competition has been unsuccessful. For one thing, it is not always simple to define what is ""honourable"", in Mr Hayden's parlance, and what is not. If stealing a policy document is kosher, why not a vaccine? The line between espionage and subversion is also blurred: is Russia stealing emails to understand American policy, or to publish them later? It is not always clear until after the fact.
Most so-called cyber-attacks are simply espionage. But espionage conducted over computer networks has enabled intelligence gathering on a scale that was previously impossible. Though America has been as much a beneficiary of this intelligence revolution as it has been a victim, it has grown less tolerant in recent years. American views of ""what's allowed in cyberspace"" have changed since the opm breach five years ago, says Max Smeets of the Centre for Security Studies in Zurich. Such large-scale espionage ""would be now at the top of the list of operations that they would deem as unacceptable,"" he suggests.
Yet forbidding something is different from stopping it. ""Deterrence is mostly irrelevant in an intelligence contest,"" writes Joshua Rovner of the American University in Washington, a scholar-in-residence at the nsa in 2018-19. ""No combination of threats and promises will stop a rival intelligence service from collecting information."" Sturdier defences are needed. *"

NEW YORK
A Manhattan boutique peddles pandemic presents
LAST YEAR New Yorkers might have found a pair of headphones or perhaps some woolly socks in their Christmas stockings. Some lucky ducks might have found tickets to a Broadway show. This year's most popular stocking-stuffer may be the portable ultraviolet-light sanitiser wand, which comes with a handy bag. It is one of the big sellers, says Valerie Zirema, who works in CV19 Essential, New York City's first dedicated coronavirus-prevention shop.
The urban-survivalist shop, near Macy's department store, looks like a cross between an Apple Store and a pharmacy. It has everything a tech-minded, fashion-conscious New Yorker could want to navigate a pandemic. Disposable masks in fun patterns and colours are especially popular. ""People want fashion and function,"" says Benjamin Hu, the shop's manager. And they love the gadgets, many of them touchless technology. As well as cheaper goodies like the masks and uv wands, the shop also sells a $10,000 system which scans people's temperature as they enter a shop. Another device can detect if someone is not wearing a mask and sound an alarm.
Midtown Manhattan is quiet now. Most office workers are working from home and tourists have disappeared. The city has seen an alarming jump in covid-19 cases, which have more than tripled since the start of November. Hospitalisations and intubations are increasing, too. Restaurants have closed their dining rooms again. On December 14th Bill de Blasio, the city's mayor, warned New Yorkers ""to be ready now for a full shutdown, a pause like we had back at the end of the spring"". But the covid-19 shop, which also provides rapid testing and PCR testing for the virus, is seeing an increase in footfall.
CV19 Essential was founded by Tony Park, the owner of Samwon Garden, a Korean bbq restaurant. After he fitted it out with uv light systems, anti-microbial film and a facial thermal scanner, other firms came looking for advice. Seeing a business opportunity, in September Mr Park opened his first covid-19 shop in a space where he originally intended to have another restaurant. He has since opened a second branch.
Opening safety boutiques and testing centres geared towards anxious New Yorkers is clever. ""I like to think people are taking [prepping] more seriously,"" says Jason Charles, head of the New York City Prepper's Network, a survivalist group, who has seen more interest in his talks. Yet with luck business may not be brisk for long. On December 14th, even as New York prepared to shut down again, health-care workers began administering the first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the borough of Queens. If the roll-out goes to plan, those sanitising wands might soon end up in a drawer, along with other forgotten gifts."

WASHINGTON, DC
Shutting schools has hit poor children's learning in America, too
CLOSED SCHOOLS are bad for all children, but especially bad for poor and disadvantaged pupils. This basic pattern recurs wherever and whenever researchers look for it-in the wake of an epidemic of polio in America in 1916, after teachers' strikes in Argentina since the 1980s, and after a devastating earthquake in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir in 2005.
Most natural experiments in school disruption come after isolated natural disasters. The covid-19 pandemic is leading to a simultaneous global experiment, however. In America, where schools have been significantly disrupted for the better part of a year, the first batches of reliable data are being gathered to assess how bad the damage has actually been. Sorting through them shows that sadly, America has not defied the gloomy predictions.
A recent analysis of standardised tests carried out by McKinsey, a consulting firm, found that pupils examined in the autumn had learned 33% less maths and 13% less reading than expected. For schools that are majority non-white, the learning losses were much steeper: pupils there had learned 41% less maths and 23% less reading. nwea, a producer and administrator of standardised exams used in primary and secondary schools, published its own review of autumn scores that was less worrying. Pupils slid back substantially in maths, but not reading, with few detectable differences along racial or socioeconomic lines. But a substantial share of students, disproportionately poor and non-white, simply did not take the tests this year- which may have flattered the results.
In Washington, dc, 73% of white children in kindergarten and 45% of black children typically show adequate reading progress. When examined this year, white children showed a modest drop in adequate literacy, to 67%, while black children experienced a much larger one-to 31%. The gaps are also showing up in coursework, not just exams. Teachers in Los Angeles are reporting a stark increase in the number of failing grades-with the greatest increase in poor neighbourhoods. Researchers from Brown and Harvard universities examining data from Zearn, an online maths-teaching platform, found that pupils in high-income schools are actually performing 12% better in their coursework than in January 2020. But for lowincome schools, scores fell by 17%.
The results suggest that the fears of worsening achievement gaps at the start of the pandemic were justified. There are enormous racial gaps in the kinds of instruction being received: 70% of black and Hispanic children are receiving fully remote education, compared with 50% of white pupils. Parents with the means to do so appear to be pulling their children out of public education altogether. There are 31,000 fewer pupils in the New York City public school system than in 2019; the roster in Austin, Texas, is 6% smaller. Instead, parents are hiring private tutors to teach their children in person. That is almost certain to widen the achievement gap.
Standardised exams are far from perfect. They do not measure the learning of impatient children well. More meaningful measures of lost learning, such as wages in adulthood, will not be known for years. Yet tests are not all bad. Given third-grade maths scores, researchers can quite accurately pick out which children will go on to become patent-holding inventors. They need not be a counsel of despair. Learning loss is remediable. But it requires the sort of serious investment that only Congress could provide and, so far, the gridlocked House and Senate have not seemed especially interested in providing it."

For maurice cook, a community organiser in Washington, dc, the covid-19 pandemic has brought mostly the worst of times- but in some ways the best.
The poor black neighbourhoods where the burly Washingtonian has spent 20 years trying to improve educational opportunity are among the most ravaged in the country. Plagued by generations of poverty and ill-health, black residents of the capital city have succumbed to the virus at six times the rate of whites. And with government-support programmes running dry, even as many of Washington's restaurants and other businesses remain shut, years of steady poverty alleviation in the city are unravelling.
""The effects of covid-19 look like this,"" said Mr Cook, gesturing grimly, while handing out masks in an encampment of homeless people one wet and icy day this week. Huddled beneath an underpass, a short walk from Capitol Hill, its rows of dowdy tents had doubled since he began distributing basic supplies there early this year. Yet he has at least had unprecedented backup in that effort. ""The incomers, the gentrifiers, they really stepped up,"" he said.
Having refocused his education efforts on disaster relief as soon as the pandemic hit, Mr Cook emerged as a local leader of a distinctive form of civic engagement, known as mutual aid. Harking back to hardscrabble times, before the passage of the New Deal, its advocates preach the virtues of neighbourly ""solidarity"" over ""charity"", which left-wingers such as Mr Cook consider paternalistic and obnoxious. The origins of the phrase ""mutual aid"" make that seem even more Utopian.
It was the title of a book published in 1902 by an aristocratic Russian anarchist, Peter Kropotkin, in which he promulgated a vision of communal harmony drawn from his observations of birds and beavers co-existing on the harsh Siberian tundra. The term was then dusted off by the Black Panthers to describe a multi-city programme of free breakfasts for children launched by the radical group in 1969. With at least nodding bipartisan support, nonetheless, the mutual-aid networks that have mushroomed in most American cities this year are a rare bright spot in the crisis.
Mr Cook was inundated by offers of help, mostly from local white professionals. A tweeted call-to-arms from one of his early supporters, Allison McGill, a social worker at a largely white evangelical church, elicited 3,600 offers. There were perhaps few true Kropotkinites among these volunteers (though that is another verboten word for mutual-aiders such as Mr Cook; they prefer ""members""). ""Mutual aid is not reducible to one political valance,"" says Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy at the Urban Institute-who, coincidentally, also does a food run every other week for Mr Cook's Ward 6 Mutual Aid. Yet at least some of the original leftist vision is still evident in their efforts.
The Facebook page of Ward 6 Mutual Aid presents a heartwarming exchange of offers and requests for English language tuition, flat-pack-furniture assembly and Christmas presents for children. The group's fundraising and distribution of basic goods-including face-masks, food and clothing for several hundred poor Washingtonians-is more recognisably Tocquevillian. Though there are no reliable national data on the phenomenon, a multitude of similarly engaged new mutual-aid groups have sprung up across the country.
Julia Ho, a leader of St Louis Mutual Aid, describes its 1,700 ""members""-and also the network's origins in the racial justice protests that roiled nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014-15. Kristen Gonzalez of Mutual Aid nyc points to that huge network's slick database, which she helped compile. It lists 131 groups across the city, ranging from "" li Face Masks for the People"" on Long Island, to ""The End is Queer"", a citywide endeavour. The evidence of Lexington's own neighbourhood, which has launched quieter schemes to shop for elderly residents or feed the families of poor classmates, suggests the phenomenon may be more common still. It speaks to America's volunteering tradition. And to the paradoxical sense of reciprocity inherent in an infectious-disease crisis in which suddenly everyone has a stake in everyone else's health.
Set against the enormity of the crisis-and the more than $3trn that Congress threw at it in April and May-the social impact of this do-gooding will be marginal. Contrary to a recurring fantasy on the right, notably pushed by George W. Bush and Paul Ryan among others, charity is never a substitute for the government action required to alleviate poverty or a crisis of this magnitude. As the effects of the stimulus have worn off, the poverty rate has duly soared. Figures released this month suggest that it has grown by almost a quarter in the past five months, easily the fastest pace in half a century. There are meanwhile indications from Ward 6 and elsewhere that, as expectations of a successful vaccine roll-out climb and the temperature drops, the zeal for volunteering (or membering) is tailing off. Yet it could leave a lasting mark, in politics as well as philanthropy.
Leftier than thou
That could in theory be on the right. One of the Panthers' unwitting contributions, notes Joanna Wuest of Princeton, was to spur Ronald Reagan, as governor of California, to boost the state's food-assistance programme as a retaliatory measure. Yet, given the donothing mentality of today's Republican Party, it is much easier to imagine the mutual-aid groups augmenting the rise of left-wing activism. Decentralised and tech-savvy, they are part-modelled on leftist campaign groups such as Indivisible. They have in turn championed those groups' politics. A striking feature of this year's Black Lives Matter protests in Washington was the mutual-aid stalls handing out free face masks, food and water. Thus have protest, campaigning and volunteering become dynamically reinforcing on the American left. For good or ill, this may turn out to be one of the major legacies of the Trump era. *"

S&Acaron;O GONÇALO
The hard-up received huge welfare payments during the pandemic. These may soon dry up
IN THE FINAL days of a tight mayoral race in November in Sāo Gonçalo, an unglamorous city across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, one of the candidates, a retired police officer known as Capitāo Nelson, made his way down a street lined with supporters. The mood was euphoric. A maskless man with a bottle of sanitiser on a string around his neck stomped his feet to funk music and squirted the gel into the air ""to kill the germs"" of the rival party. Humberto Perez, a handyman, likes the captain ""because he cares about poor people, just like the president"", Jair Bolsonaro. After work dried up in March a monthly payment from the federal government kept him from going hungry. ""And the campaign gave me a free lunch,"" he said, with a toothy grin.
The fact that some Brazilians are celebrating during a pandemic that has killed 180,000 of their fellow citizens is among covid-19's many paradoxes. So is the reason for their cheer: that a right-wing, pro-market government has rolled out the biggest welfare programme in Brazil's history. Before the pandemic, extreme poverty was on the rise. Nearly 1m families were on the waiting list for Bolsa Família, a conditional cash-transfer programme that the government had cut back after a recession in 2014-16. In March 2020 widespread hunger seemed imminent. Paulo Guedes, the economy minister, proposed to spend no more than 5bn reais ($1bn), 0.2% of the budget, to fight the pandemic.
But momentum began to build in Brazil's Congress to provide a basic income to poor people. Realising that it risked looking miserly, the government announced that it would give monthly payments of 600 reais to 68m Brazilians, a third of the population. Single mothers got twice that. In September the government halved the benefit, called auxilio emergencial (emergency aid), but extended it until the end of 2020. Brazil's fiscal response to the pandemic, which also includes job-retention schemes, adds up to more than 8% of gdp, among the highest for G20 countries and twice the average for emerging markets. Congress declared a ""state of calamity"" to allow the government to bypass a constitutional ceiling on spending.
But with public debt approaching 100% of gdp, the government now faces a moment of truth. The state of calamity ends on December 31st, and with it the auxilio. Brazil can do one of three things: chop welfare spending to pre-pandemic levels, breach the ceiling or enact fiscal reforms that would allow it to maintain both. The third choice is the best, but it is also the most difficult. Since a landmark pension reform in 2019, the government has done little to cut spending or improve its effectiveness.
The auxilio has been a remarkable success. For more than 7m informal workers who lost their jobs, it was a crucial safetynet. It tripled payments to 14m families who had received an average of 190 reais a month from Bolsa Família. The auxilio lifted 1m people out of extreme poverty (see chart on next page) and kept another 15m from becoming poor. Fundaçao Getulio Vargas (fgv), a university, found that Brazil's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, swiftly dropped from 0.55 to 0.49, which is a lot. Poverty and inequality are the lowest since fgv began tracking them in 1970.
Brazilians whose pockets were empty after years of low growth bought televisions and ovens. Millions opened their first bank accounts. The poor north-east experienced a construction boom. After a 9.7% contraction in the second quarter, the 1 economy grew 7.7% in the third. It will shrink in 2020 by half as much as many economists had predicted.
Mr Bolsonaro's approval ratings climbed, smoothing the way for an alliance with the centrāo (big centre), a bloc of opportunistic centre-right parties in Congress. ""The expectation of victory and power brings us together,"" says Ricardo Barros, now the government's whip. Centrāo candidates were the biggest winners in the local elections. They included Capitāo Nelson, who won an upset victory against his left-wing rival. He promised money for new clinics and more police.
That will be a hard promise to keep. The stimulus was a ""huge dose of anaesthesia that numbed the pain of the pandemic"", says Marcelo Neri of fgv. On January 1st ""it will wear off"". The unemployment rate of 14.6% is the highest it has ever been. People in the poorest half of households have lost 28% of their earnings. ""Unwinding all the extraordinary support in the coming months could risk derailing the incipient recovery,"" warns the imf. Millions could fall into poverty.
If Brazil tapers spending gradually, as other countries plan to do, it will breach the ceiling, which was enacted in 2016 to control rising debt. It limits growth in most federal expenditure to the previous year's rate of inflation. Because 94% of the budget is eaten up by mandatory spending (chiefly pensions and salaries), little is left for investment and social programmes. In 2019 the government spent 3obn reais, or 0.4% of gdp, on Bolsa Família. The auxilio cost ten times that.
Some Brazilians think the ceiling is essential to prevent an eventual default. But Brazil's debt is largely denominated in its own currency, which reduces that risk. If interest rates were to rise uncontrollably, the Central Bank could buy government debt. The cap matters more as a sign of commitment to reforms, says Arthur Carvalho of Truxt Investimentos, a hedge fund. ""If you can't cut anything in a mammoth state to fund an important social programme, you can't make choices,"" he says. The imf urges Brazil to keep the ceiling and make space for a more targeted benefit in 2021 by ""swiftly"" passing money-saving reforms. Brazil risks hyperinflation if it scraps the spending ceiling, warned Mr Guedes in an interview with The Economist.
Neither big reforms nor a change in the spending cap is in prospect, which means welfare spending is set to fall. The damage to the poor will be modest, Mr Guedes thinks. The beneficiaries of the auxilio ""were alive before the pandemic"", he said. ""They had informal jobs"" cleaning houses or selling sweets on the beach. ""If the economy recovers they'll be back."" Mr Guedes is bullish about that. ""We will end this year with zero net jobs lost in the formal labour market,"" he predicts. ""I challenge any country to beat our record.""
His boss is less relaxed. Mr Bolsonaro wants to launch a new programme, Renda Cidadā (Citizens' Income), which would help more families than Bolsa Família, although fewer than the auxilio. But he has rejected proposals for how to pay for it. ""I can't take away from the poor to give to the poorer,"" he said when Mr Guedes suggested trimming other programmes.
There are other ideas. Congress is considering an ""emergency"" constitutional reform that would curb public-sector pay and tax exemptions. This would free a bit of cash for welfare. More would be available if that reform were coupled with an amendment to make the spending limit more flexible during crises, suggests Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank in Washington. ""You could do this without spooking markets,"" she says. But Congress signalled last week that it will discuss the emergency measures only in February at the earliest. Mr Guedes promptly said he would take a holiday.
The government and Congress could put off a reckoning by extending the state of calamity, using a second wave of covid-19 as its justification. Mr Guedes has hinted he might endorse that. It would merely postpone the choice between fiscal reform and welfare cuts. The auxilio ""can't last for ever"", says Carlos Jordy, a congressional ally of Mr Bolsonaro who attended Capitāo Nelson's rally. Mr Perez, the handyman, may learn painfully that there is no such thing as a free lunch."

The government finally ends its dual-currency system
After years of dithering, Cuba is finally about to take the plunge. On December 10th the country's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, announced that on the first day of the new year it would abolish one of its two currencies. That is a big step towards ridding the socialist economy of distortions that thwart production, drain the treasury and keep people poor. But it leaves in place many enterprise-crushing rules and creates new problems that the government will struggle to overcome.
It set up the dual-currency system in 1994, when the country was reeling from the loss of subsidies from the Soviet Union, on which it had relied during the cold war. Alongside the Cuban peso it created the cuc, a convertible currency pegged to the dollar at one to one. It hoped this would prevent Cubans from dumping pesos in favour of dollars. Importers, which are state-owned, use cuc to obtain dollars on favourable terms, which makes imports cheap. Most Cubans, who work for the state, are paid in pesos. It takes 24 pesos to buy a cuc at the official exchange rate. Workers in the country's growing private sector, most of whom are paid in cuc, earn seven times what state employees make.
The abolition of the cuc is meant to make the public sector behave more like the private one, and give private firms a better chance to compete. Firms and consumers will now use just pesos, initially at the official rate (though the dollar will remain important). State pensions and salaries are to rise fivefold. But inflation, already high, will increase. Subsidies for water, transport and electricity are being diminished.
To cope with these stresses, the government has introduced new distortions. Besides keeping controls on prices for some goods (many of which are scarce) at new higher levels, it has imposed them on such services as hair cuts and shoe repairs. Firms that profited from access to cheap dollars will get government help for a year to delay mass lay-offs. Cuba will enter the single-currency era with an overvalued exchange rate. On the black market the dollar sells for 35-40 pesos.
Mr Díaz-Canel's big-bang reform does not let farmers decide what to grow or at what price to sell. Nor does it allow entrepreneurs, who create most new jobs, to incorporate. These needed changes and others may be coming. The government has said that some small firms, like restaurants, will be privatised. Cuba's communist regime has sped up its reluctant conversion to market economics."

AMSTERDAM, BOULDER, DENVER, LONDON, ROTTERDAM AND ZOOM
On the roof of a derelict building in a Dutch city Frankie and Dora sip Taiwanese bubble tea as they bask in the summer sun. ""People have parties here all the time,"" Frankie says knowingly, nodding to broken bottles and rolling her eyes at a loud group farther along. The two girls are dressed in vintage jeans, selfdecorated sneakers-they prefer ""customised""-and tshirts with a message. Frankie's celebrates an art exhibition, Dora's Billie Eilish, a singer whom she likes because she speaks her mind ""on things like Black Lives Matter and justice and stuff.""
The girls discovered this spot through TikTok, an app which they think should be banned because ""there's so much bad stuff on it now, like rape."" They learned about the tooth-achingly sweet bubble tea- popular with teenage girls from Chengdu to California-from ""Insta"" (Instagram). The naughtiest thing they have done recently is sneak out to a blm protest their parents said they could not go to because of lockdown. They do not think there is anything they cannot do because they are girls. ""I think that's from another time,"" says Dora.
Frankie, Dora and their tens of millions of 11- to 16year-old peers in the rich world are having a girlhood like none before. Their mothers have been far closer to social and economic equality with their fathers than in previous generations; they have a bewildering online world of social media to navigate; and they are exposed to a world changing, politically and climatologically, in a way that provokes and resonates with all manner of emotional uncertainties. Like all adolescence, this new girlhood is both intensely personal and universal. Talking to dozens of these girls in Europe and America over the past year, in person in some cases and over a lockdown Zoom in others, sometimes one-to-one and sometimes in loud joyful groups, The Economist heard of TikTok and bubble tea, anger and activism, make-up tutorials and trampolining, anxiety (both theirs and their parents) and big plans for the future (ditto). What came out most strongly was the girls' sense of shared identity and shared potential.
One of the changes is that being a girl is now seen as a thing in itself. For centuries, much of girlhood was defined in opposition to boyhood; being nice when they were nasty, quiet when they were loud, social when they were sullen, pretty when they had personalities. Briefly, late last century, things went the other way, with girls increasingly encouraged to be sporty, loud and assertive.
One of the ways you can see that boyhood has now become increasingly irrelevant to girlhood is that girlhood is changing in ways that boyhood is not. Girls are allowed, and allow themselves, a range of interests, behaviours and attitudes that is broad, varied and flexible. Boyhood remains more narrowly defined both by society at large and by boys themselves.
Those who sell things to children and parents have noticed the change. Debi Clark from Bizzykidz, a child modelling agency, says advertisers demand a broader spectrum of ""types"" than they used to when looking for girls; for boys one size still fits all. Axel Dammler of iconkids & youth, a German research firm, says, ""There is almost no point in advertising to girls because they now have such wide-ranging interests and identities."" Most boys can be sold football and a handful of popular video games, but ""today's girls are into everything"", he says with a mix of exasperation and admiration.
The girls we talked to confirmed what researchers have found: that, by and large, this broadening is working out well for them. This does not mean everything is awesome. Girls in most rich countries consistently report being slightly sadder than boys do, particularly from puberty onwards. They can be mean to each other, and to themselves. Frankie says she sometimes ""just suddenly feel[s] so ugly that I break down.""
Things can be made harder by a world that does not yet know quite what to make of these new girls. The response to their still frequent exploitation is often to treat them simply as innocents in need of protection against bad men, social-media manipulation and, of course, their naive selves. At the same time they are celebrated as an empowered army of Greta Thunbergs on which the world can pin its hopes for the future.
Being liberated from a specific girl ""mould"" or a boy ""anchor"" does not mean girls do not assign themselves, or have forced on them, a large range of sometimes contradictory roles. They are friends; daughters; possessors of bodies; activists; and tomorrow's women. Each role provides a glimpse of their future-and a feeling for the richness of their present.
Friends
The friendships between girls have provided rich subject matter for female artists from Jane Austen to the Spice Girls to Elena Ferrante. The intensity and closeness of girl-friendships is an experience that many women feel shapes their lives. It is also one of the first things girls mention when asked what they like about being a girl.
What makes Frankie and Dora friends is trust. The two girls (whose names, like those of all the other girls in this piece, have been changed to preserve their privacy) have been friends since they became buurmeisjes (neighbour-girls) at the age of two. They ""just know"" that they can count on each other when life, and other relationships, get complicated. Dora tells Frankie everything ""because she's Frankie. She's like my diary.""
Confiding in each other is a key part of girl-friendship. That said, anyone who has-or once was-an adolescent daughter knows that this girlish intimacy is not an unmitigated blessing. Girls are more likely than boys to be the object of nasty rumours and to be excluded by their peers. Yet girls' closeness arms them with invaluable support. ""It reassures them that they are likeable,"" says Julia Cuba Lewis, from Girls Empower- ment Network, an American non-profit. ""A strong friendship helps create a stronger girl.""
For many girls their first proper friend is their first introduction to love beyond their family. Even if ""I love Gary"" eventually takes over, girls often start with scribbling ""Sharon and Lina, best friends forever"" on notebooks and bathroom-stall doors. Where previous generations were tied to the landline, even if they stretched its cord as far away from prying parents as they could, the mobile phone has freed friendship from all shackles of distance and time. Frankie once spent an entire night FaceTiming a friend (her parents now confiscate her phone every evening, ""to protect me against myself""). Almost all the girls we spoke with said that not seeing their friends was the hardest part of lockdown. A survey by Britain's Children's Society confirms this was the case across British 10- to 17-yearolds, and that girls struggled more than boys.
Where boys' friendships are typically formed ""side by side"" around shared activities, girl-friendships tend to form ""face to face"" around emotional self-disclosure: hence the increased drama, hence the increased importance.
Hence, also, durability. Many studies in various countries have confirmed that female friendships are more intimate and supportive. There is a reason why, at least in America, grown women still refer to their ""girlfriends"". Boys in close friendships often drift apart in their teens even though, when asked, older boys often express an unmet need for close fellowship. At the same age girls tend to come closer together than ever.
""We fully understand each other, we can rely on each other. If we have a bad day we help each other,"" says Cyrene, a 15-year-old in the break room of a Denver high school. ""Boys just don't do that."" Her friends Kya, Grace and Orenda agree vigorously. They are sharing a pizza as they discuss what makes them friends. They laugh a lot. They enjoy ""being weird"" together-a phrase girls across countries and backgrounds use to denote an unconstrained silliness they prize. Many formative experiences were shared: their first trip to the cinema, their first visit to an Asian restaurant, and, as they reveal a few months later over Zoom, their first online activism. The word ""support"" comes up a lot. When they discuss tough subjects they rub each other's shoulders, squeeze each other's hands, whisper reassuringly and hug liberally.
Daughters
All four Denver girls list their mums as their role models, and say they always have. How parents treat their daughters, and how those daughters respond, is perhaps the thing which most clearly sets this generation of girls apart from those who came before. For many girls home is now the place they feel least likely to encounter sexism. In 2018 a survey found that over half of American girls between 10 and 19 felt that they were treated differently in sports, and around a third in school and online. Just one in eight said that happened at home. In 2014 a household survey found only 6% of adult American respondents disagreed with the statement that ""Parents should encourage just as much independence in their daughters as in their sons.""
In the 1970s American parents who had only boys spent significantly more on their children than parents who had only girls. By 2017 the difference had disappeared, according to Sabino Kornrich of NYU-Abu Dhabi. Girls today enjoy more parental spending on things like tutoring, art supplies and music lessons than boys. In China parents of children in high school are more likely to hire a tutor for daughters than sons and to expect them to go to university. ""Because girls often perform better than boys, parents start to have higher expectations and invest more in girls than boys,"" explains Jean Yeung Wei-Jun, a researcher at the National University of Singapore.
Ironically, some old gender stereotypes may now be helping girls. When girls are toddlers they are read to more than boys. Their fathers are five times more likely to sing or whistle to them and are more likely to speak to them about emotions, including sadness. Their mothers are more likely to use complex vocabulary with them. Most of this gives girls a leg up in a world that increasingly prizes ""soft skills"". Girls still have less leisure time than boys, but nowadays that is primarily because they spend more time on homework and grooming, rather than an unfair division of chores. And in the time left for themselves they have far more freedom.
Girls are also brought up by single mothers at a historically unprecedented rate. Most of the Denver girls have a (step) father somewhere in the picture, but they call their mothers their ""reason to be good"" and ""the man of the house"". Kya says that when she was born her mother was only a year older than Kya is now; she beams when she says she now runs her own car-body repair shop. Like Cyrene's mother, also a mother in her teens, she has been to night school, too, a further source of daughterly pride. ""She is just unbelievably strong.""
The mother-daughter relationship is formative whether or not a father is present. Young girls whose mums reject gender stereotypes about maths do better at maths (dads' opinions on the matter appear to have no effect). Girls whose mothers speak openly with them about periods and sex are significantly less likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour.
But when there are two parents both matter. Research suggests that girls may be more sensitive to parental encouragement than boys; those whose parents built up their confidence were significantly less likely to feel tense about school, more likely to perform well, less likely to drop out of sports and less likely to have body-image issues.
Sarah, a 12-year-old, wants to become a surgeon. She dials in from her purple bedroom surrounded by pillows with pictures of dogs. She loves rock climbing (""the adrenalin is amazing""), baking cookies and ""dissecting stuff"". Her proudest accomplishments include a frog, a squid and a dogfish. Her dad helped fuel her interest in the cookies and the corpses. Her mum makes challah with her every Friday. Her favourite thing about being a girl: ""Surprising people"". She cannot think of anything she does not like.
Daughters can change parents' values too, particularly fathers'. Researchers at the London School of Economics have found that having school-age daughters decreases fathers' likelihood of holding traditional attitudes on gender roles and makes them more likely to pull their weight at home. Separate studies have shown that having daughters affects decisions by politicians, judges and ceos. Men with daughters are more likely to hire women for their boards.
One thing most girls agree on is that their parents take too one-sided an approach to technology. ""My parents think it's all a bunch of drama and distraction and that we're all addicted to social media,"" complains Ida, ""but it can be really inspiring, too. There are lots of women...standing up for things.""
Ofcom, Britain's communications regulator, has found parents increasingly worried that the risks of the internet outweigh its benefits. Unrealistic beauty standards, self-harm, eating disorders, celebrities who glorify plastic surgery, porn, sexting and predatory men all keep them up at night. They are more likely to restrict girls' phone use than they are boys', and they are more likely to wander in and check on their daughters while they are online (with sons they prefer to check their internet history afterwards).
One American mother imposes similar rules on her son as on her daughter, but worries more about the exposure her 14-year-old daughter gets. ""She's far more mature and curious than he is,"" she says; since she got a phone a year ago she has used the internet for ""wonderful art projects"" but, confronted with ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", also learned a bit about bondage. Another makes a point of trying all the apps her daughter gets into, ""including dancing on TikTok"". She is amazed by the breadth of information. ""We just had magazines,"" she says of her childhood in India. ""They have access to everything, everything.""
Bodies
Despite all the liberation and broadening identities, there is one thing that girls still feel narrowly judged on: their bodies. More than half of 10- to 19-year-old girls in America think attractiveness is the trait that society values most in girls. Seven in ten of those between 14 and 19 feel judged as a sex object.
Random men have shouted ""pornoblondje"" (little porno blonde) at Frankie when she passed on her bike. ""I've been called all sorts of things while walking down the street just because of what I was wearing,"" says 13year-old Ana from New York, who never knows what to say even though it makes her angry inside. Amy, 14, was sent ""something bad"" by a man on Instagram. She did not tell her parents and does not want to talk about it. The number one reason American girls give for sexual comments going unreported is a fear of being less liked (""kindness"" is second only to attractiveness in what they think society values most in them).
When asked what they like least about being a girl, most of the girls we spoke to mention their bodies: ""periods, blegh"", ""my thighs, yuck"", ""crazy emotions"". But even more mention how they are perceived; ""being looked at in a certain way"", ""having to be ladylike"", ""being told to smile"".
That girls have issues both with their bodies and the way those bodies are perceived is not new. In 1950 a study titled ""Adolescent concerns with physique"" noted widespread worries among girls over ""fatness, thinness, tallness, shortness, lack of development, exceptionally early development, blackheads, pimples, bad eyes, irregular teeth, ugly noses and receding chins."" Girls in Britain have consistently been unhappier with their appearance than with any other aspect of their lives, according to the Children's Society. In the 1990s a series of panic books, led by Naomi Wolf's bestseller ""The Beauty Myth"", claimed consumer culture's obsession with the female form was causing an ""epidemic"" of anorexia among girls and women. A study in the journal Eating Disorders found that Ms Wolf's statistics were on average inflated by a factor of eight.
That worries are exaggerated and sensationalised, though, does not mean they lack foundation. Girls very rarely kill themselves; they are less likely to do so than older women or boys and men of any age in many rich countries. But the number of 10- to 14-year-olds who have done so in America has more than tripled since 1999. In England hospitalisations due to self-harm by girls have risen by nearly two-thirds over the past 12 years. The rate of girls reporting depressive symptoms has increased. Researchers disagree about how much of the documented rise in mental-health problems among girls is down to symptoms being more readily recognised than they used to be and how much is down to girls' lives having changed. ""There are lots of reasons to be hopeful about this generation of teen girls,"" says Candice Odgers, a researcher at uc Irvine. But ""they are sadder. Maybe that's because of the world we've built.""
Some changes to the world, though, offer respite. Take sports: more than a century after the reinventor of the Olympic games, Pierre de Coubertin, deemed including females ""impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and improper"", more girls are playing sports than ever before. Those who do have fewer mental health problems and are happier about their bodies.
Girls can and do feel good about themselves online, too. Where a negative relationship between social-media use and girls' well-being has been found, it was small, about the same as the impact of wearing glasses, says Amy Orben, at the University of Cambridge. And the direction of the relationship is unclear. A recent Canadian study found that early mental-health problems in young girls can be a predictor of social-media use later, but not the other way around. Social media may make things worse for girls experiencing problems already, but for most they are fine.
And they are valued. Girls balk at the idea that there is anything wrong with taking selfies and are keen to show how creative TikTok and Tumblr can be. They are clear that ""my body, my choice"" extends to being allowed to care about their looks. Ziggy, in London, says some people have an attitude that ""you can either be Instagram-famous or smart but not both."" She rejects it. ""You can be like the male-fantasy version of a girl and you can be interesting and have depth...Posting pictures of yourself does not take away your depth."" Nor do the images need to be of a particular type. ""Being a girl means I can be as girlie as I want to be or not,"" says Alyssa, a 13-year-old from California.
The known negative impact of traditional medialong home to airbrush and photoshop-is greater than that of social media, well stocked with ""normies"". The idea that photo-editing tools on phones are inciting a plastic-surgery boom is baseless. ""I think my parents think I'm some idiot who believes everything I see online,"" says Isla, from Brighton, with an eye-roll. In general, girls don't. (A pertinent example, if one from a small study: whereas one in five older boys think online porn is a realistic portrayal of sex, only 4% of girls do.) When a class of girls in another school in Denver is asked to respond to a set of statements about social media, none of them agrees with ""I think all depictions on social media are realistic."" Most assent to ""Social media has impacted how I feel about myself."" All support ""I've complimented someone else on social media."" The online world is a place to act, not just absorb.
Activists
The annual ""We Are Girls"" conference, held at a high school in Austin, Texas, offers sessions such as ""Robotics and You"", ""My Changing Body"" and ""Divas and Diversity""; the girls who attend have the opportunity to be taught football tackles in full gear and to decorate wands with glitter while discussing Disney princesses. But first they must get their girl power on.
At the opening rally 1,000 girls stamp their feet in the high school's gym as a woman in 1970s fitness gear spurs them on with Tigger-like energy. Some girls take out phones to film, others look embarrassed and cling to friends or hide in their hoodies. Latecomers look startled. But soon the bleachers are rattling as the majority shouts and whoops and jumps.
""Who run the world?"" the keynote speaker asks.
""Girls,"" roars the crowd.
""Who?""
""GIRLS!""
A little boy in soccer kit-taken along by his mother because practice was cancelled-covers his ears.
Girls are increasingly told-and increasingly feelthat they wield power. And if they do not, in truth, believe that they run the world, they certainly want to improve it. Ask them about role models and their mothers tie with Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai, campaigners for climate action and education. No one else comes close.
Most of those we talked to call themselves activists, even if they are not all pushing petitions to set up recycling schemes or exploring the application of ai to the environment (both activities we came across). Sexism, racism, lgbt discrimination, poverty, animal cruelty, homelessness, climate change, littering, universal health care, environmental destruction, beauty standards and inequality all get them riled up. Many are livid about ""idiots"" not following covid-19 rules and causing unnecessary death and suffering. ""The one good thing about covid is that it's good for nature and the environment and dolphins,"" says Sarah, ""but I wish it wouldn't kill so many people in the process.""
Carol Gilligan, a psychologist, points out that young girls have long been seen as voices of outspokenness and honesty, from Iphigenia in Euripides' tragedy to Claudia in Toni Morrison's ""The Bluest Eye"" to Jane Eyre. As they hit their teens, though, they used to have a tendency to stop speaking up, pressured as they were to become ""likeable"" young women.
Today's girls still care about being liked. ""What's changed,"" says Ms Gilligan, ""is the enormous resonance their voices now have."" Strong currents in society are telling them that, now they have the tools needed to speak louder-from education to the internet to freedom to leave the house-their voices will be heard. That makes continuing to speak out both a duty and a thrill: a bold new way to be a ""good girl"".
Some of their concerns are close to home. In early March the Denver girls told us that they felt more judged by their race than their sex. ""I think girls are more understood than black people,"" says Grace. ""They instantly think I'm ghetto, I'm loud, I have no intelligence because that's how we're seen."" Like several teens we spoke to during lockdown, she and her friends were frustrated at not being able to join blm protests. But they have been ""signing petitions, reading articles, sharing information and calling for and demanding justice,"" Kya says in an email.
The internet is both a resource for their activism and a venue for it. Jo, a 12-year-old from London, complains that being ""only allowed a Nokia-it doesn't even have emojis"" makes it hard to gather signatures for her online petition about period poverty. (She understands why her parents worry but still says ""it's really annoying"".) The other key venue is school. In California Naomi, who is 14, says the racism she witnessed during the response to covid and the killing of George Floyd moved her to collect experiences from other students and write a letter to her school asking for classes to cover racism from fourth grade, that is around the age of nine or ten. Martha, Ana's 15-year-old sister in New York, has moved from pushing teachers at her school to include climate change in the curriculum to lobbying for climate education nationwide. Whenever she and her friends talk to someone powerful, they post a picture on social media, tagging it and ""thanking them for agreeing to whatever they agreed to do. It's a good way to hold them accountable.""
Some, like Jo, fight for issues related to their gender. All the girls are angry about the gender pay gap and sexual harassment. This does not mean they see themselves as feminists, a term which only 28% of 10- to 19year-old-girls in America use to describe themselves, according to a Plan International survey. ""The word [feminism] tends to elicit really negative responses,"" says Mies, an 11-year-old from Amsterdam. ""Especially from boys."" They much prefer to talk about gender equality-or more-than-equality. ""Women are superior,"" Cyrene says matter-of-factly. ""They just are. You know, you're a woman.
""I know boys are biologically stronger,"" she adds thoughtfully. ""But no one cares about farms anymore.""
Tomorrow's women
Girls' adolescence does not just offer a wider range of possibilities than it used to. It also lasts longer. In the West girls now start puberty around the age of ten. The age has dropped mostly, it appears, because of better diet. For black girls, who typically have a higher bodymass index and lower birth weight, things come even earlier. Nearly one in four African-American girls has started puberty by the age of seven, compared with 15% of Latina and 10% of Caucasian girls.
The onset of sexual activity, though, is getting later (and being handled better: teen-pregnancy rates are falling across the world). And education is lasting longer. There is thus room for girlhood to stretch out. But not indefinitely.
In 1972 a group of working-class girls in Ealing, London, were asked to rank their life priorities. They ticked love, a husband and a career in that order. When the same survey was repeated in 1994 the outcome had more or less reversed. We asked the girls we talked with to rank their priorities for the future on a form. ""Interesting job"", ""Change the world"" and ""Financial independence"" were reliably found near the top. ""Love"" was in the middle; ""Marriage"", ""Get rich"" and ""Have children"" were low-and sometimes crossed out.
A capacity for self-reliance is seen as crucial. ""I want a good education and a good plan for the future,"" says 11-year-old Ela in California, before adding that she also really wants two dogs. ""I definitely want enough money to support myself and however many kids I have,"" says Martha in New York. The girls in Denver need any families they have to be financially independent more than they need them to include a man. ""I could get the fancy dessert, but I don't need it,"" declares Cyrene. Kya agrees: ""If I do end up alone, I'll just have my best friends.""
An hour's drive north, in Boulder, a group of girls who had just pulled an all-nighter for an extra-credit maths class is equally lukewarm about love and marriage-but clear about other aspects of their future. Jennie plans to major in chemistry and piano, then go to med-school and become a surgeon or a medical professor (teen girls in the oecd are nearly three times as likely as boys to say they want to be doctors). Lou says she will double-major in computer science and engineering and then work in aerospace engineering ""on ai stuff"", perhaps at nasa. Like the Denver girls, several imagine adopting one day, with or without a partner.
Personal goals and aspirations for the world are closely bound up. Girls in America are more likely than boys to say that they want to make the world a better place; they are also more likely to say they want to be a leader. Jo, in London, says she hopes that when she leaves university ten years from now the world will be more equal-""and also that it hasn't exploded."" Asked if this worries her she frowns: ""Well yeah, because of global warming. Greta Thunberg says there's quite a real chance of some ginormous catastrophe that we're never going to be able to solve."" Her government's handling of covid has made her ""very angry""; she is considering a career in politics, though, she confides, ""I'm not sure I'll manage as I have quite a lot on my to-do list.""
High expectations are undoubtedly a risk. ""Society still tends to see girls as either in crisis or as superheroes. We're still looking for a happy medium where girls can just be human and are allowed to make mistakes,"" says Angelica Puzio, a doctoral candidate at nyu. Deborah Tolman, an author who has studied girls for decades, notes that girls often cannot see the scaffolding and support behind ""sheroes"" like Greta and Malala, and worries that ""if they are not saving the world they'll feel bad for letting people down."" When you ask girls what makes them anxious, many indeed mention pressure: pressure to do good, look good and be good. ""There's a constant pressure to be polite and kind and out there and confident,"" says Ziggy: in reality, she feels at best ""confident-ish"". Telling girls they need to develop more confidence is just code for another thing they need to fix and be better at, writes Rachel Simmons, an educator, in ""Enough as She Is"".
But that is not to say that they cannot find confidence in themselves, or bring it out in each other. When she is asked ""Do you think you can change the world?"" Sarah looks panicked. ""By myself? Oh God no. What if I can't fix all the problems?""
Then she realises the ""you"" is plural, which changes everything.
""Oh, you mean all girls,"" she says with a sigh of relief. ""Of course we can.""
She loves rock climbing baking cookies and ""dissecting stuff""
""I know boys are biologically stronger, but no one cares about farms anymore."""

A champion of moderation who had the misfortune to live in a revolutionary era
Desiderius Erasmus was the last great intellectual of a united Christian Europe: a scholar of universal renown, a friend to kings and tutor to princes, and a self-proclaimed ""citizen of the world"". He produced a translation of the New Testament that changed the way Christians think about their faith. He also shaped popular culture. His dictionary rescued phrases such as ""breaking the ice"", ""teaching an old dog new tricks"" and ""leaving no stone unturned"" from obscurity. His ""In Praise of Folly"" (1511) was hailed as a comic masterpiece.
In an age when birth was generally destiny, he was a self-made man. Born in the small provincial town of Rotterdam in 1466, the illegitimate son of a priest, he was dumped in a local monastery at the earliest opportunity. He grew up far from the centre of the Renaissance in northern Italy. His subsequent stardom was purely the result of his extraordinary intellectual gifts.
Unlike so many other great thinkers, in his time and since, Erasmus never fell prey to extremism. He believed in the healing power of moderation and reason, and in the civilising power of wine and conversation. This was partly a matter of personal style. He craved a life of scholarly comfort: ""He lived in his study and died in his bed,"" as the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper put it. Confronted with a king-and potential patron-he bent the knee; challenged by a bully, he changed the subject.
It was also a matter of conviction. Erasmus loathed the certitude of ideologues and worried about the tendency of extremists to goad one another into greater acts of fanaticism. In place of revolutionary certainty, he preached the Middle Way. The best way to reform the establishment was from within, he argued. The Catholic church should be reinvigorated by calling it back to its original purpose; society should be reformed by educating princes in the art of government.
But this moderate champion had the great bad luck to live in a zealous era. Soon after climbing to the intellectual and social pinnacle of Europe, Erasmus was thrown down and condemned. Only after his death was he given his due. His story is a warning to modern moderates, but also an inspiration.
When Erasmus left his monastery and began to explore the world, he was astonished by the sorry state of the church. Nepotism was rife. Popes fathered children and advanced them, disguised as nephews, into wellpaid jobs. The largest businesses in Rome were the wine trade and prostitution. The papacy preyed on the credulity of the laity by selling indulgences-""forged pardons for real sins"", in Erasmus's words. Leo X, pope during Erasmus's glory years, was the spirit of corruption made pudgy and pampered flesh.
The church's material self-indulgence was equalled by its intellectual desiccation. Universities were selfperpetuating oligarchies of obscurantists and suckups. A doctorate in theology at the Sorbonne took a minimum of eight years to complete and an average of 18. Erasmus described his teachers there as ""quasi theologians"" whose ""brains are the most addled, tongues the most uncultured, wits the dullest, teachings the thorniest, characters the least attractive, lives the most hypocritical, talk the most slanderous, and hearts the blackest on Earth.""
How could the church be rescued from its torpor? Erasmus believed that the answer lay in rediscovering the spirit of Christ. He did not believe, as some Christians did, that it was necessary to get rid of your property and devote yourself to the poor. Rather, for Erasmus it meant producing a perfect translation of the Bible based on the best texts available, assembled from libraries across Europe. For how could you hope to imitate Christ unless you knew exactly what he had said and how he had lived? Renaissance scholars in Italy had provided a model of how to revive classical studies by producing improved classical texts. Erasmus's great scholarly achievement was to import these techniques to northern Europe and apply them to biblical texts.
This inaugurated one of the great love affairs of his life, with ancient Greek. At the age of 30 he determined to make his Greek as good as his Latin (which was re- garded as the best in Europe). He was astonished by what he found as he read classical Greek texts as well as fragments of the Bible. Whereas ""we Latins have but a few small streams, a few muddy pools,"" he wrote, ""the Greeks possess crystal-clear springs and rivers that run with gold."" His ""Novum Instrumentum"" was the first Greek New Testament ever published. He put the Greek text next to the Latin Vulgate and his own ""pure"" Latin translation, which extirpated what he saw as linguistic corruptions in the church's approved text.
Like the Protestants who would soon convulse Europe, Erasmus believed that Christ's message should be taught by and to everybody. Forget the waffling of the theologians: a ""few truths are enough."" And forget the superstructure of the church: what really matters is the Word. ""I would have women read the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul...I would have the ploughman and the craftsman sing them at work; I would have the traveller recite them to forget the weariness of his journey ...True theology is possessed by every man who is possessed of the spirit of Christ, be he digger or weaver.""
Erasmus's scholarly distinction brought him success in the secular world as well as the religious one. His admirers included almost all the crowned heads of Europe-the kings of France and Portugal were correspondents and the king of Scotland a pupil. He was a particular favourite of the ruler of his native state, Archduke Charles, who, as Charles V, went on to become Holy Roman Emperor and the most powerful man in Europe. Hans Holbein the younger, whom Erasmus supported, painted several portraits of him. Though he enjoyed the flattery, Erasmus used his connections to pursue a higher goal-to persuade the rulers of Europe to lead their people into an era of Christian enlightenment. What better way to reform government in an age of royal power, he calculated, than to educate the royals themselves?
His ""Education of a Christian Prince"" (1516) was written as practical advice to Archduke Charles. Erasmus argued that the king is a servant of the people and must rule according to the principles of honour and sincerity, a revolutionary notion disguised as flattery. In ""The Prince"", published three years earlier, Machiavelli had argued that it was better for a ruler to be feared than loved. Erasmus argued, on the contrary, that it was better to be loved than feared, and suggested that the way to create a lovable prince was to give him a well-rounded humanist education. A ruler should be learned (""man unless he has experienced the influence of learning and philosophy is at the mercy of impulses that are worse than those of a wild beast"") and should cultivate the habits of gentleness and public service.
He proceeded to dish out advice to the class of educated Europeans who operated the machinery of the state. ""Enchiridion Militis Christiani"" (""Handbook of a Christian Soldier"") argued that Christianity was above all an ethical system of charity, love and generosity. A succession of school textbooks were designed to show that classical learning was a joy rather than a chore. In place of mechanical grammar books he produced selections of the great classical authors. Technology helped spread his fame. The printing press had been invented a quarter of a century before his birth and the great printers of his day (Thierry Martens of Lausanne, Jose Badius of Paris and Aldus Manutius of Venice) had established international distribution networks. ""In Praise of Folly"" was one of the first secular bestsellers, with more than 30 Latin editions appearing during Erasmus's lifetime.
He thus embodied a new social ideal: the humanist scholar who rejected monkish asceticism and the arid scholasticism of the university professors. He was genial and civilised: after books, he liked nothing more than good food, good wine and good conversation. He had a gift for friendship, enjoying an intellectual romance with the English humanist Thomas More. But he also had a talent for mockery, which he wielded against the pompous, pedantic and closed-minded. ""In Praise of Folly"" attacked everyone from doctors (quacks and flatterers, in his eyes) to monks (donkeys braying out psalms that they had memorised because they could not read). This earned him a legion of fans: the Erasmians who thrived in courts across Europe and who pored over his every pronouncement.
Bulldozing the Middle Way
Erasmus's happy world began to crumble in October 1517, when Martin Luther, his junior by 17 years, nailed 95 theses to the door of the Wittenberg Castle church. Erasmus sympathised with many of the young monk's criticisms of the church. But he disliked Luther's dogmatic temperament and feared the consequences of smashing the institution that, for all its faults, sat at the heart of European civilisation. Surely Luther's extremism would provoke counter-extremism? And surely the battle would destroy the Christian humanism that Erasmus had spent his life cultivating?
Both sides of the emerging schism initially tried to win the great man's approval. This put him into an impossible bind. He could not repudiate Luther without repudiating some of his own criticisms of the church. But he could not support the pope wholeheartedly without endorsing corruption. Reluctantly, Erasmus stuck with the Catholic church on the grounds that institutions are easier to reform than fanatical mobs inspired by a charismatic preacher. That soon seemed like bad judgment. Rather than taking Erasmus's Middle Way, the church embraced religious orthodoxy, empowering the most reactionary elements in the hi- erarchy and stretching every sinew to destroy heresy.
Erasmus was reduced from hero to bogeyman. ""My popularity, if I had any, has either cooled off so far that it scarcely exists, or has quite evaporated, or even has turned into hatred,"" he wrote in 1523. Luther denounced him as an ""enraged reptile"", ""vainglorious beast"" and ""instrument of Satan"". The Catholic church denounced him as a proto-Luther. ""Erasmus laid the eggs,"" a monk from Cologne wrote; ""Luther hatched them. God grant that we may smash the eggs and stifle the chicks."" One of his translators was burned at the stake. In 1546, ten years after Erasmus's death, the Council of Trent exploded his life's work by declaring that the Vulgate was the only acceptable translation of the Bible. In 1559 the Index of Prohibited Books banned his entire oeuvre, along with the works of 550 other writers. The edict was not withdrawn until 1966.
As Michael Massing shows vividly in ""Fatal Discord: Erasmus, Luther and the Fight for the Western Mind"" (2018), the growing religious battle destroyed Erasmianism as a movement. Princes had no choice but to choose sides in the 16th-century equivalent of the cold war. Some of Erasmus's followers reinvented themselves as champions of orthodoxy. The ""citizen of the world"" could no longer roam across Europe, pouring honeyed words into the ears of kings. He spent his final years holed up in the free city of Basel. The champion of the Middle Way looked like a ditherer who was incapable of making up his mind, or a coward who was unwilling to stand up to Luther (if you were Catholic) or the pope (if you were Protestant).
Yet the next hundred years of European history bloodily confirmed Erasmus's warnings about the dangers of religious extremism. Luther denounced the pope as the Antichrist while comparing Rome to Sodom and Gomorrah; the pope called Luther a ""roaring sow"". Then came the book-burning and the statuesmashing. Finally, the fanatics graduated to burning their fellow human beings at the stake. The cycle of intolerance was matched by a cycle of self-righteousness. Protestants competed with their fellow Protestants, and Catholics with their fellow Catholics, to see who possessed the purest heart and the fiercest faith. The test of being a good Christian ceased to be decent behaviour. It became fanaticism: who could shout most loudly? Or persecute heresy most vigorously? Or apply fuel to the flames most enthusiastically?
Erasmus had predicted that Luther's theological complaint would lead to war. In time, he wrote, ""the long war of words and pamphlets"" would be waged ""with halberds and cannons"". He was proved right many times over as fanatical passions fired terrible conflicts. The Thirty Years War killed more than a third of the German population and featured every imaginable atrocity, from torched villages to mass rapes to widespread torture, including waterboarding.
But great ideas are harder to kill than people. At first Erasmian ideas went underground-an astonishing fate for a philosophy that had thrived on the patronage of princes. Intellectuals preserved Erasmianism in private and talked about it in whispers. Then it began to resurface. The Jesuits smuggled elements of Erasmianism into their Catholic philosophy: Ignatius of Loyola based his ""Spiritual Exercises"" on Erasmus's ""Enchiridion"". Supporters of a more tolerant style of Protestant Christianity, such as the one that emerged in Britain after the Puritan revolution, dusted off their Erasmus. The most intellectually accomplished reviver of the Erasmian tradition was arguably a Jew, Spinoza, who put the notion of scepticism at the heart of his great treatise, the ""Tractatus Theologico-Politicus"".
A world of folly
Erasmus is now celebrated by people of all religious inclinations and none. In his native city of Rotterdam a university, a grammar school and a subway station have been named in his honour. The European Union's ambitious student-exchange programme, from which more than 10m have benefited, bears his name. The University of Toronto has produced an 89-volume edition of Erasmus's collected works, one of the greatest scholarly projects of our time. Fittingly, one of the editors, James McConica, is a Roman Catholic priest who embodies Erasmus's learned, epicurean style.
The spirit of the Middle Way has not conquered all-far from it. The West is now in the grip of rival extremisms that mock every principle that the great man held dear. Everywhere ideologues are breaking eggs and murdering chicks. In Britain, Brexiteers denounce ""citizens of the world"" as ""citizens of nowhere"" and cast out moderate politicians with more talent than they possess, while anti-Brexiteers are blind to the excesses of establishment liberalism. In America ""woke"" extremists try to get people sacked for slips of the tongue or campaign against the thought crimes of ""unconscious bias"". Intellectuals who refuse to join one camp or another must stand by, as mediocrities are rewarded with university chairs and editorial thrones.
But the 16th-century humanist should give hope to those who resist competing bigotries. Erasmus shows that moderates are right to warn about the awful consequences of extremism and intolerance. He also proves that you can triumph in the long term even if you are crushed in the short term. Modern advocates of the Middle Way may not be rewarded with an 89-volume edition of their collected works. But they at least have the comfort that they were on the right side of history when their fellow intellectuals were taking the line of least resistance or maximum fanaticism. ·
He believed in the healing power of moderation and reason, and in the civilising power of wine and conversation"

The country's hiking culture reflects its social pressures-and offers a reprieve from them
SEORAKSAN
Atypical day on a South Korean mountain starts much like a typical day in a South Korean office: with a subway journey. At a station in southern Seoul, scores of people emerge into the crisp dawn air carrying backpacks and hiking sticks, and walk towards a long row of coaches. Kim Sun-hui, an efficient woman in wire-rimmed glasses and a red woolly hat, checks names against a list next to the bus chartered by ""Wanderung"", a club named after the German word for hike. Soon Mr Park, the driver, closes the doors. The bus trundles past high-rise apartment blocks before turning east towards Seoraksan, the country's favourite national park, some 200km (124 miles) away.
Hiking is South Korea's most popular pastime. Twothirds of its citizens own a pair of hiking boots and tackle a mountain at least once a year; nearly a third go once a month. In 2018 they spent $2.3bn on hiking gear, more than on cinema tickets or cosmetics. The country's 22 national parks welcome around 45m visitors every year. During holidays, newspapers print pictures of long queues of people waiting to take photographs next to the national flag that marks many peaks.
Ask a South Korean about the allure of mountains and you are soon deep into nationalist mysticism. ""We like to think of ourselves as descendants of the mountain god,"" says Choi Won-suk, who directs the centre for mountains and culture at Gyeongsang National University in Jinju. Dangun, the mythical founder of Korea, is said to have been born on the slopes of Mount Paektu, on the border between China and North Korea. He was the son of the sky god and a bear who became a woman after subsisting for weeks on garlic in a cave. The mountain features in the national anthems of both North and South Korea.
A simpler explanation is that going hiking is easy. South Korean mountains are not too high: the tallest peak, Hallasan, is just short of 2,000 metres. And they are everywhere. Unlike in Europe or America, few people live more than an hour or two from one of the 18 ""mountainous"" national parks. Seoul, where half the population lives, contains several mountains that can be conquered during a long lunch break. ""It's just a very obvious thing to do in your spare time,"" says Park Misuk, who teaches at a mountaineering school on the slopes of Bukhansan, just north of the capital.
The country got its national parks in a hurry. The first, in Jirisan, was designated only in 1967. By the end of the 1980s South Korea had protected more than 6,000 square km, amounting to 6% of its land area. It was inspired by America's national parks, and advised by American experts. The two countries continue to co-operate on signage, nature preservation and safety. But South Korea has developed a hiking culture quite unlike the American (or the European) one.
The coach that Ms Kim and Mr Park are piloting to Seoraksan (snow mountain) hints at some of the differences. The mostly middle-aged men and women snoring lightly on board have signed up through an online forum, where hikers swap tips on logistics, equipment and routes. Many South Koreans are members of hiking clubs, or book places on coach tours to get to the mountains. On the footpaths, you see large groups of people more often than families or lone hikers.
That could be a legacy of military rule. Park Chunghee, the strongman who ruled South Korea in the 1960s and 1970s, encouraged conglomerates to push their employees out onto the trails as a community-building activity. He also insisted on military drills not unlike those still practised north of the border. Corporate culture has become a little more relaxed since then, although an ambitious executive may still find it expedient to scale the occasional mountain with the boss.
A culture of long working hours and short holidays encourages efficient hiking. Mountain paths tend to head directly for the summit, and rarely feature the switchback turns seen in other countries. South Korea has a whole infrastructure designed to get stressed leisure-seekers to, up and back down the mountains as speedily as possible. The plan on Ms Kim's bus, which sounds distinctly ambitious to anyone used to a more leisurely pace, is for the hikers to tackle Seoraksan's highest peak before it gets dark and return to Seoul well before the last subway train heads for the suburbs.
Some mountain enthusiasts disapprove of this approach. ""A lot of people only care about getting to the top and down again as quickly as possible,"" says Ms Park, the hiking instructor. ""That's not really the point."" Ms Park, who abandoned a career as a nursery teacher to teach people about mountains, thinks that people should pause to take in the surroundings. ""For me, mountains are about contentment-I've had so many hobbies, but whenever I look back at pictures of myself on a mountain I just look happy.""
Stairway to heaven
Mr Choi, the geographer, concurs that the focus on reaching the top is misguided. ""It's a very modern thing, this haste and competitiveness,"" he told your correspondent on another, more gentle hike up a small mountain overlooking Jinju. ""Mountains are intertwined with life, including at the end,"" he explained, as he pointed out small mounds of graves lining the path. Mr Choi argues that the desire to rush uphill was imported to South Korea by Japanese colonisers-who, in turn, got it from the West.
He harks back to centuries-old conceptions of the hills as spiritual places, home to hermits and mountain spirits. To him, they are places to work towards pungsu, a traditional Korean system of thought close to the Chinese idea of feng shui, which stresses harmonising people with their environment. In the past, he says, climbing mountains was about finding harmony with nature and reflecting on your own shortcomings. ""It's not about getting up to the top and winning but about looking up to the top thinking, I'm not there yet. I need to grow more.""
More than four hours and several traffic jams into the journey to Seoraksan, some of the passengers on Ms Kim's bus seem to be reaching similar conclusions. As midday approaches, the plan to reach the summit and return to the bus before sunset is beginning to seem foolhardy. The mood on board has darkened. Voices are raised. But the delay does not prompt anyone to reconsider. When Mr Park at last pulls up at the pass where the hike begins, people rush for the door and jog towards the stairs that lead up the mountain.
The stairs hint at what is to come. For the first couple of hours, the path climbs steeply towards a granite ridge, now hidden in clouds, now gleaming in the sunshine. A stiff breeze blows, prompting hikers to zip up their jackets. The leaves on the trees have begun to turn deep shades of red and orange. The higher the path climbs, the easier it becomes to forget how steep it is. With every turn, the views over the peaks grow more spectacular.
It was views like this, along with his dislike of the rat race, that prompted 65-year-old Cho Myung-hwan to quit his job as a computer salesman to spend his time hiking and taking pictures of mountains, trees and flowers. ""You know that feeling when you're tired and restless and there are all of these people in front of you-and then you catch sight of the view,"" he says. After quitting his job, Mr Cho lost touch with many friends. His wife, who disapproved of his decision, has grown fed up with accompanying him on his hikes. He says he does not mind: ""I've never been very sociable, and I enjoy just being with the mountain.""
As the hikers climb Seoraksan, the crush of people disperses. Soon whole stretches of the trail are deserted. ""It opens my heart coming up here,"" says Go Eun-mi, an accountant from Suwon who is hiking with her husband. ""You can forget things in the mountains, particularly now during the pandemic.""
Farther up on the ridge, a group of men are sitting under a tree eating lunch. They have brought miniature folding chairs, beef jerky and tangerines, which they offer around. Lee Jun-gyu, a video editor, aims to climb as many peaks as possible in the Paektu mountain range that runs through the Koreas like a spine. ""Hiking the range is bound up with my hopes for reunification,"" he says.
As the afternoon wears on and the wind picks up, it becomes clear that the plan to reach the peak was indeed overambitious for many of Mr Park's passengers. Having turned around at various points along the ridge, they trickle back down the mountain in the waning light. Your correspondent calls time on her ascent at a jagged rock about halfway to the peak (she later returned to conquer it). She catches a glimpse of the sea, the dome of an observatory and what look like radio towers-a reminder of the other Korea just a few miles to the north. On the way down, the sweeping views are obscured by fog. She stumbles down the final set of stairs to the car park as darkness falls.
A long, cold hour later, Mr Park's bus appears, carrying the hardy souls who managed to rush all the way to the top of the mountain. On the way back to Seoul the mood is jolly, helped along by swigs of makgeolli, a local rice wine that some hikers are sipping surreptitiously. When a suspicious whiff of orange peel begins to mingle with the smell of sweaty boots, Ms Kim intervenes: ""Stop eating, and put your masks back on.""
A typical day on a South Korean mountain ends much like a typical day at a South Korean office: with a bleary-eyed late-night subway ride. But Ms Go is right: the head feels clear, and the heart remarkably open. ·

Sometimes history is made circuitously
A little after 10pm on Monday July 3rd 1967, just as most sensible Britons were turning in for the night, the member for Pontypool was warming up. Leo Abse (pronounced Ab-zee) had been working the tea rooms of the House of Commons all day, charming and cajoling his fellow mps in his rococo tones-a little flattery here, a white lie there. Now he slipped into the chamber, turning heads as always in spite of his short frame. Settling in his usual perch on the Labour government's benches, his mischievous eyes darted about the place, searching out both his ""stout fellows"" and his foes. If his bill were ever to get through, tonight was surely the night.
The House had already been sitting for 12 hours. It had found time to note the teacher shortage in Scotland, the need for better provision for heroin addicts and the lack of geriatric hospital beds in the Hull area. It had mused on the sorry state of the river whose waters sploshed against the Palace of Westminster. The lack of moorings and amenities on ""Old Father Thames"" was a disgrace. At last Big Ben, that parliamentary alarm clock, struck ten, and it was Abse's turn.
His bill, printed on the green pages each mp clutched, was plain enough: that, in England and Wales, ""a homosexual act in private shall not be an offence provided that the parties consent thereto and have attained the age of twenty-one years"". Beside him on those green-leather benches sat his staunch supporters, a new generation of youngish, whipsmart Labour mps more familiar with cloisters than coal mines. There was Dick Taverne, a 38-year-old barrister, and Shirley Williams, a passionate liberal who had run the Fabian Society, a leftish think-tank. And Roy Jenkins, home secretary and fellow Welshman, who cherished the idea of Britain as a ""civilised society"".
The benches opposite were sparser, but their occupants no less determined. There was Ray Mawby, a moralising drinker not yet unmasked as a communist spy, Harold Gurden, a dairyman before his election 12 years earlier, and Ian Percival, who promised-or threatened-""to speak through the night if necessary"". To them, gay sex remained ""the abominable crime""; legalising it after 434 years would be yet more damning evidence that England was becoming not a civilised society but a permissive one. They intended to propose amendment after amendment, and to greet each in turn with another lengthy, digressive speech. All they had to do was keep talking.
To make any progress, the proposers had to call a ""closure motion""-a proposal to curtail discussion and move to a vote-on each amendment. But Parliament's rule book dictates that such motions can pass only if they are supported by at least 100 mps. So Abse had to keep enough of his supporters in the chamber not just for the final vote but to see off each amendment in turn. As the night wore on, his enemy was not so much those on the opposite benches as sleep: ""It only needed one or two people to go home...to say 'To hell with this, I can't stay until the dawn,' and we were undone.""
It would hardly have been the first defeat. Craning over from the Commons gallery to get a better view of the chamber below were a band of men well used to having their hopes dashed. They were no strangers to Parliament. They had awaited eagerly its debate in 1958 on the Wolfenden Report, an official review that recommended nixing the ban on gay sex that had held since the Buggery Act of 1533. Nothing came of that. Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister, told colleagues that loosening the law would lose their party 6m votes.
You can live your life lonely
Few men were successfully prosecuted for sex in private, but the threat ensured that blackmail flourished and the closet door remained firmly closed. Some formed loveless marriages; others sought medical help. As Abse worked on his bill, John Wells, a 27-yearold phonetician at University College London, began attending weekly psychotherapy sessions to deal with the ""problem"" of his homosexuality. The year before he had split up with his first boyfriend, who-under pressure from his family-had then married a woman.
Into this vacuum came the House of Lords, Parliament's unelected second chamber. Stuffed with crusty aristocrats who had inherited their fathers' titles (and voting rights), it was an unlikely crucible of social reform. Yet, virtually irremovable as they were, there was little to stop their lordships speaking their minds. The eighth Earl of Arran (""Boofy"" to his chums) had persuaded his fellow peers to vote for reform in 1965. He never told them his likeliest motivation. His older brother, whom he succeeded to the earldom, took his own life at the age of 55. Years later, Abse met a man who claimed to have been the seventh earl's lover. In public, Lord Arran's rationale was more pragmatic, and characteristically Wodehousian. ""It simply needed someone to grasp the nettle. And a damned prickly nettle it was, too.""
Most mps still feared its sting. The Lords provided momentum, but support in the Commons was necessary for a bill to become law. No government would risk backing such a contentious measure, so it could reach the statute book only via a private member's bill, a mechanism that allows mps to put forward their own laws. Such bills rarely pass, since little time is allotted to them. By 1967, Abse and Humphry Berkley, a Tory parliamentarian, had already proposed some measure of liberalisation three times without success.
One more try
Still, this time might be different. After all, Abse had friends in high places. Jenkins was one of a new breed of Labour mp who wanted the party to marry breadand-butter leftism with social liberalism. As one wag had it, Labour should be the party of ""full enjoyment"" as well as full employment. Each time Abse's bill was frustrated, Jenkins persuaded the government to lend it some of its own time in the Commons, albeit sometimes at ungodly hours. Which is why the gas lamps outside the Palace of Westminster were burning, casting shadows along its Gothic façade, as, inside, the Speaker finally called the House to order that night.
Big Ben was about to sound the next hour by the time Abse got to his feet for the first time. His opponents had already made the running for three-quarters of an hour and he was anxious to get on. ""If I am brief in speaking to this amendment,"" he began, ""I am sure that it will be appreciated that it is out of no discourtesy to the House but because we are dealing with a matter which has been well canvassed.""
Abse was not normally so ready to pass up a chance to expound. The limelight was, if anything, a little dark for his liking. He embraced the old Commons tradition of dressing up for Budget day. Out came the top hat and cane, a fresh bloom in his buttonhole. The rest of the year, he favoured a dark green jacket over a mustard waistcoat and maroon trousers. He would stick one thumb in his waistcoat pocket during his lengthy and ornate speeches, enveloping the House in his lyrical, somehow religious, embrace. The Welsh have a pretty word for such oratorical magnetism: hwyl. Abse had bags of the stuff.
His interests, too, were colourful, stretching far beyond Pontypool, the mining town in south Wales that he had represented since 1958. He was a successful criminal solicitor, relishing representing suspected murderers, and a keen amateur psychoanalyst, emulating his hero Sigmund Freud. He would go on to publish a slew of eccentric ""psycho-biographies"", attributing John Maynard Keynes's ""bold economic theorising"" to his affairs with men, and Margaret Thatcher's steely resolve to the ""deprivation she felt at [her mother's] breast"". The title of one of his later books indicated the range of his interests: ""Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love"".
Given the need to overcome opposition from sobersuited moralisers, Jenkins was understandably wary of Abse's involvement: ""He wasn't exactly the person I would have chosen to be the sponsor of the bill."" Yet it proved a profitable partnership. Jenkins squared the cabinet and spoke publicly in favour of the bill, all the time claiming that the government remained neutral. Meanwhile, Abse put his self-avowed guile to work, enlisting his allies and circumventing his opponents.
He contrived an argument with himself over whether to exclude the merchant navy from the bill, whipping up the issue in the press. As he hoped, his opponents seized on this. So confident were they that it would take up the first few hours of the bill's consideration by a parliamentary committee that they did not plan to turn up and table their own amendments until the next session. In the event, Abse swiftly agreed to that amendment-as he had always planned to do- and the committee stage was over within an hour. Before this final debate, he had spent the day circling the tea rooms and bars of the Commons, bestowing wide smiles, witticisms and promises of future support. ""It's not just house-to-house fighting,"" he liked to say. ""It's room-to-room.""
Praying for time
The night wore on. Again and again, that great clock tolled. Still, the diehards spoke on, each digression pootling along until chancing upon another.
First came the member for Bromsgrove: ""When we last discussed this unpleasant subject, I raised the history of two young people who were taken from this country to the south of France...""
mr speaker: ""Order. I hope that the honourable gen- tleman is not going to repeat the story. We have a long debate ahead of us.""
The member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, chipped in: ""I am not clear on what my honourable friend is saying about this sentence. He referred to it as a sentence for five years...""
mr speaker: ""Order. When an honourable member is trying to get back into order, an intervention should not encourage him to go out of order again.""
Then the member for Southport, anxious lest his long and rambling speech be misinterpreted: ""I hope that we shall have no more of the nonsense that we have had in the House and the press that if someone dares to have a different point of view-on detail, for I am keeping to the amendment-and dares deploy an argument about it, that is filibustering. I am sorry to see those, self-styled, of enlightened opinion being so intolerant of the opinions of others. That was, in fact, my last but one general observation..."" mr speaker: ""Order.""
How am I gonna get through?
One by one, Abse's supporters were shuffling off to bed. Fatigue was winning. On the first motion to halt discussion and move to a vote on an amendment, at 11.37pm, Abse had 135 supporters, comfortably more than the threshold of 100. By the second, at 1.25am, he had only 116. It was, he said, ""on a razor's edge"".
And still the opposition went on talking. Every argument was advanced. Any possibility to run down the clock was seized. Since the bill would decriminalise gay sex only in private, what would happen, the member for Bromsgrove wanted to know, if two men were spotted through their hotel window?
The member for Birmingham, Selly Oak speculated on the motivations of the bill's supporters. ""According to the figures we have heard and seen published, there is quite a percentage of people who practise homosexual acts. It would be strange indeed, in a place of 600 members, if there were not some here..."" (Lord Arran, whose other great cause was badgers, reached the same conclusion. Asked why his badger-cruelty bill failed, he replied: ""Not many badgers in the House of Lords."")
Big Ben was about to ring out again by the time the member for Bromsgrove turned his attention to the matter of sleeper trains:
""Two passengers who occupy adjoining sleepers after boarding a train at Euston are committing no breach of British Railways by-laws if they indulge in this practice, but as soon as the train crosses the border and goes into Scotland they are committing an offence. Is this the right way to leave a bill? Are British Railways sleeping-car staff to receive instructions to blow a whistle at the border?""
At length, seven and a half hours into the night, the bill's opponents had exhausted all their arguments. Or perhaps they were just exhausted. In the end, there was no need for another closure motion. The member for St Albans made one last attempt to stall. Now that the amendments had been considered, he argued, the debate should be adjourned to another day. The Speaker refused, and a substantive vote was finally called, at 5.44am. Fourteen diehards had lasted all night, voting against the bill to the bitter end. Across the lobby, there were 99 ""Ayes"". Abse had won, by attrition.
It had been a long road. For Jenkins, who would have little sleep before Independence Day drinks at the American Embassy and an afternoon at the Wimbledon tennis championships. (Full enjoyment, indeed.) For Lord Arran who, under such strain for so long, had been ""permanently if slightly pickled"" for more than a year. Once, when someone scrawled ""Arran homo"" on the walls of his club, he ""hardly dared to hold my head high. Indeed I thought of resigning from my club until I woke up and said to myself 'Why the bloody hell should I?'"" And, of course, for Abse, who went on to champion more private members' bills than any other parliamentarian of his generation. He wanted to be remembered as ""the member for happiness"".
With many a winding turn
His bill was imperfect. Since it made a specific offence of sex in public toilets, prosecutions rose in the decade after the bill was passed. By modern standards, the arguments he and Lord Arran deployed were themselves prejudiced: homosexuality was a ""condition"" to be pitied and not to be ""flaunted"". And gay sex remained illegal in Scotland until 1980 and in Northern Ireland until 1982. It is still outlawed in 68 countries. Still, that night those stout fellows-men and women-loosened the shackles a little. Blackmail grew rarer; the closet door was left ajar.
As Abse, shattered, triumphant, emerged into Westminster Palace Yard, the gas lamps were still burning. Collapsing into his second-hand Rolls-Royce, he drove home to his wife, Marjorie, ""who was in bed, still awake, anxiously awaiting me and my news. She took me into her arms."" It was a year before Mr Wells, the phonetician, met another man, Gabriel. They moved in three weeks later. With Gabriel's support, he stopped going to psychotherapy; he realised it was society, not him, that had a problem. Today, 52 years on, they are still together. In 2006, as soon as they were able to, they signed a civil partnership. That long night was at an end. At long last, daylight was coming. ·
""It simply needed someone to grasp the nettle. And a damned prickly nettle it was, too""
Abse wanted to be remembered as ""the member for happiness"""

How a deal struck in the dying days of apartheid afflicts modern South Africa
the age of 74, with barely enough feet and inches Ato peer over the steering wheel, Sizani Ngubane makes for an unlikely racer. Yet one afternoon in October she hurtles up the N2 motorway, which hugs the east coast of South Africa before heading inland through the heart of the former Zulu kingdom, swerving past trucks and errant cattle.
Not for the first time, Ms Ngubane (pictured above) is on a mission. She and your frazzled correspondent arrive in the town of Jozini as the sun wanes behind hills dotted with fever trees. We are just in time to meet applicants in a court case co-led by Ms Ngubane's organisation, the Rural Women's Movement, that could strike a blow against one of the most controversial institutions in South Africa.
The Ingonyama Trust Act was enacted three days before the election in April 1994 that brought apartheid to a close and Nelson Mandela to power. The act made a special case out of the ancestral lands of the Zulus, the largest ethnic group in South Africa. The law vested trusteeship of the land in the Zulu king, currently Goodwill Zwelithini, and established the Ingonyama Trust to manage it. According to the act the trust must serve the people who live on the land-a population of more than 5m across an area about the size of Belgium. But its critics allege that the trust acts more like a punitive feudal landlord.
In the case brought by Ms Ngubane, which was heard on December 9th and 10th, lawyers for the applicants argued that the trust acted unconstitutionally by undermining residents' property rights. During apartheid many black South Africans in rural areas were given ""permission to occupy"" (pto) certificates: an informal right less secure than a freehold but that a post-apartheid law said could not be withdrawn without the holder's consent. By allegedly cancelling ptos and requiring residents to sign leases instead, the trust acted unlawfully, according to the applicants' lawyers. They want the leases of their clients-and anyone else affected-cancelled and ptos reinstated.
The trust denies that it coerced anyone into signing leases, which it claims are entirely lawful. It says they are in fact more secure than ptos. But if the judges disagree with the trust when they return a verdict early in 2021, the decision could change the lives of some of South Africa's poorest people for the better. It could also provoke a fierce backlash among powerful figures who benefit from the status quo.
All around me a voice was sounding
The unlikely epicentre for this potential upheaval is a sparsely populated settlement a few minutes' drive from the centre of Jozini. Getting out of her car, Ms Ngubane shuffles into a one-room concrete house to greet the applicants in the case. At the threshold a young boy spritzes hand-sanitiser into our hands; behind him an older girl squeezes past with a few coins to buy electricity credit to illuminate the room.
Ms Ngubane introduces the grandmother of the children, Hluphekile Mabuyakhulu, who is recovering from a stroke (pictured on final page). She sits upright in bed, framed by a red velour headboard. She explains that her family moved to the plot in the mid-1980s, when the induna, or headman, allocated them the land. Though water is scarce she has done her best to make do, planting fruit and vegetables in her yard.
According to her affidavit, in 2011 she was summoned to a meeting at which residents were told they must sign leases for their properties ""or we would not be recognised by the king as being part of this community"". The contracts were in English, which she cannot speak fluently. Only afterwards did she discover that she had to pay 1,500 rand ($95) per month, more than her monthly pension, to live in a house she considers hers. ""I feel like I was scammed by the trust,"" she says.
By her bedside is Linah Nkosi, a neighbour and fellow applicant. She has lived in the same house in Jozini since 1974. In 2012 she was informed that she, too, would have to sign a 40-year lease and pay rent. And the lease had to be in her then-boyfriend's name, as he was deemed the head of the household. (The trust insists that no applicant was duped.) ""In Zulu culture women are kept down, down, down,"" she says.
That reality has gnawed at Ms Ngubane since she was a girl. In 1956, when she was nine years old, her mother was evicted by her uncle. The incident led her to dedicate her life to campaigning for the rights of poor rural Zulus, especially women. It is a job that has not got easier since apartheid ended. ""It's very sad,"" she says. ""We've really dropped the ball as a country.""
In the early 1800s the Zulus were one of many cattleherding clans in the south-east corner of the continent. But under King Shaka they conquered surrounding groups to form a political entity unusual in its size, sophistication and military prowess. By the time of his death at the hands of his half-brothers in 1828, the Zulu kingdom encompassed around 30,000 square km (12,000 square miles). During the rest of the 19th century fratricidal rivalries weakened the empire from within. The expansion of the Boers and the British destroyed it from without. After many battles the kingdom became part of Natal, one of the two British colonies that in 1910 joined with two Boer-run territories to form the basis of modern South Africa.
As in other parts of Africa the British colonists introduced a system of indirect rule, in this case by the Zulu king and his inkozi, or chiefs. This provided the foundation for later policies, including the apartheidera ""homelands"": ten ethnically homogenous pseudostates used to confine, disenfranchise and impoverish black South Africans. When KwaZulu, the semi-autonomous homeland of the Zulus, was formally hewn from Natal in 1977, it drew on deep institutional roots.
In KwaZulu the government was effectively a oneparty state, sponsored by the apartheid regime and led by the Inkatha Freedom Party (ifp). Under Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the uncle of the current king, the ifp promoted a conservative Zulu nationalism with the monarch as a figurehead. As apartheid neared its end in 1993, Human Rights Watch, an ngo, described KwaZulu's political arrangements as ""dictatorial"".
Growing up, Ms Ngubane felt under a double layer of oppression-that of apartheid and the petty chiefly dictatorships. Over coffee she recalls how she was shaped by these experiences. ""I was a bad child,"" she says, with a grin. During the day she would eavesdrop on elders' conversations about village iniquities. At night she would clutch a radio to her ear and hear about the atrocities of white rule.
When she was 16 she took a job as an assistant in a dress-material shop, where she had to hide behind the changing-room curtain until any Zulu-speakers entered. Other aspects of apartheid were less farcical. The proximate cause of her father's suicide, in 1959, was the breakdown of his marriage. But Ms Ngubane cannot shake the idea that apartheid contributed indirectly. Like millions of black South Africans, in order to find work, he spent most of his time far from his family.
This land was made for you and me
""I knew something had to be done to stop the oppression of black people,"" says Ms Ngubane. She grew up in a family affiliated with the African National Congress (anc), ultimately becoming a recruiter for the party. Since the anc was banned until 1990, she had to operate stealthily. ifp saw the anc as an existential threat to its hold on KwaZulu-a state of affairs that suited the apartheid regime, which gave it money and guns. In the decade after 1985 the anc and ifp fought a low-intensity civil war. Approximately 15,000 people, including one of Ms Ngubane's brothers, were killed. The spectre of further violence, and Mr Buthelezi's threat to boycott the 1994 elections, led to the last-minute deal that created the Ingonyama Trust. (The national government became the custodian of the land of the nine other homelands.)
Since 1994, to stay on the right side of rural powerbrokers, ANC-led governments have strengthened ""traditional leadership"" in the former homelands, including KwaZulu. Several laws have underscored the old systems of indirect rule, for example by creating ""Traditional Councils"". These institutions, which have roles in allocating land and delivering services, have 60% of their members appointed by chiefs.
The arrangement seems out of place in democratic South Africa. But defenders of such laws argue that they are necessary to protect traditional cultures, such as that of the Zulus. To explain what that means, in an area a couple of hours from Jozini, Bonga Mdletshe, the local chief, has convened a meeting of his headmen.
Those with an imperial imagination may imagine Mr Mdletshe in traditional garb-cow-hide shield, spear, headband, and so on. But that is like expecting the leader of Edinburgh City Council to go to work everyday in a kilt. Instead Mr Mdletshe has the get-up of a beleaguered provincial civil servant. He is dressed in jeans, a checked shirt-and drives a lurid orange pick-up truck. After one of his induna says a prayer, he begins to describe his role.
""I'm an extension of his majesty, the king"", he says. ""I administer the tribe on his behalf and protect the Zulu culture."" That means keeping track of the family trees that make up the canopy of surrounding clans and telling stories of battles won and lost. Military culture is central to much of Zulu culture. Indlamu, a warrior dance, is performed at weddings. Rural boys still learn the art of stick-fighting. Also important is ""protecting the structure of our community""-the hierarchy that descends from the king to chiefs and headmen to the paterfamilias. For critics this is a smokescreen 1 behind which women are kept second-class citizens, for instance in polygamous marriages.
No data exist on how many Zulu men still marry multiple wives but it remains relatively common among chiefs. One induna argues that it is part of Zulu history: when many men died in battle it ensured women could still get hitched. Another says it reflects a belief that when a woman has her period she is ""dirty"" and should refrain from work. Rather than chip in, goes the logic, a man needs another wife to fill the gap.
Travelling around the former homeland it is possible to find women who are happy with such arrangements. Boneni Maphanga was one of six wives of a local businessman; he gave each spouse her own grocery shop. There was no jealousy, she says, or at least no more than in a monogamous marriage. ""We were like sisters."" Mr Mdletshe insists that women are ""greatly respected"" in Zulu culture. ""Anyone who visits my mother"", he adds, ""will crawl across the floor to greet her."" Ms Ngubane scoffs at such talk. She points to enduring customs such as virginity testing, and the annual reed-dance where thousands of bare-breasted girls parade before the king in a celebration of chastity.
It would strengthen the case of traditional authorities if they were any good at administration. But the former homelands are among the worst-run parts of the country, with devastating effects for the one-third of South Africans who live there. South Africa's ten poorest municipalities are all in former homelands. Analysis published in January 2020 estimated that 62% of working-age adults in ex-homelands have no job, versus 38% in the rest of the country.
A paper published in 2019 by Dieter von Fintel and Johan Fourie explains why destitution has persisted. The economists from Stellenbosch University argue that after the arrival of Europeans, Africans ""were at the mercy of two extractive regimes"". The first were systems of white rule culminating in apartheid. The second were the homelands and their antecedents. Both had narrow elites-one white, the other black. The pillars of apartheid have crumbled but those of the homelands remain.
In KwaZulu, the trust must administer the land ""for the benefit, material welfare and social well-being of the members of the tribes and communities"" of the former homeland. Yet in village after village there is little sign of it doing that. Conditions are often squalid. This is not all the fault of traditional institutions-municipalities are failing, too-but they share the blame.
An hour from Jozini, near the town of Mkuze, B.F. Mgwenya, another chief, shelters inside his makeshift headquarters: a dilapidated farm long abandoned by a white landowner. He says that the main challenge is getting clean water. Droughts have worsened, but neither the local municipality nor the trust has offered any help, he says. ""We used to rely on God,"" he says, recalling when nearby mountain streams gushed. ""Now we rely on government.""
Mr Malinga argues that chiefs can be suspicious of development. An induna in his village, he says, once claimed that the arrival of electricity would damage cows' eyes. ""If you want to resist change it makes sense to pretend it undermines your culture."" These views are not universal, however. On more than one occasion your correspondent was asked by chiefs or headmen whether he could help bring investment to the area. They wanted the best for their kith and kin, but they did not know how to go about it. ""We're the poorest of the poor,"" says one of Mr Mdletshe's aides.
It would help if the trust lived up to its mandate. Under statute 10% of its proceeds can go to its board for administration, but the rest should benefit local communities. Yet the public does not know what it owns, spends and earns. It is unclear whether any of this money goes to the king himself. He receives a taxpayer-funded stipend of more than 70m rand. Occasionally there are glimpses of the trust's finances via reports of the trust board to parliament. In 2018 the board reported that, in the latter half of the previous year, 96% of the board's budget went on ""administration"", versus 0.16% for ""rural development"".
Yet, according to the court papers lodged by the applicants's lawyers, the trust's rental income soared from 8m rand in 2008-09 to 107m rand in 2016-17. Meanwhile the national government is investigating the trust board amid allegations of bribing chiefs and Mr Ngwenya for alleged self-enrichment, and is conducting an audit of the board's finances. (Mr Ngwenya says the probe ""lacks the necessary legal foundation"".)
Reformists worry, though, that the anc will not take on the trust. In a major review of the nation's ills published in 2017, Kgalema Motlanthe, a former president, concluded that the trust should be repealed or amended. He later called chiefs ""village tin-pot dictators"". But when he became president a year later, Cyril Ramaphosa swiftly visited the king to assure him that KwaZulu would not be touched.
Because of Ms Ngubane's campaigning work, she has faced multiple death threats and has had to go into hiding on several occasions. ""Don't be surprised if you come back in more than one piece,"" she recalls an induna telling her when she visited his community in the 2000s. Not that such words scare her. Since she was a child she had a preternatural sense that taking on injustice is her life's mission. She has been told countless times that her work undermines the culture of the Zulus. To that argument, she has a bracing reply: ""What they're doing is not our culture-it's greed."" ·

DUBAI
A decade ago Arabs rose up. Why haven't things improved?
It is an anniversary no one is eager to mark. The numbers boggle the mind: half a million people dead; another 16m displaced from states no longer recognisable. There are the individual stories too, of dreams dashed and hopes shattered. One former activist, who long since gave up on the politics of his native Egypt, scrolls through the contacts on his phone, stopping now and then to list his friends' fates: exiled, disappeared, dead.
Ten years have passed since Muhammad Bouazizi, a Tunisian street peddler, set himself ablaze to protest against the corrupt police who confiscated his wares. His self-immolation, on December 17th, is widely seen as the spark that ignited the Arab spring, a wave of revolutionary protest that swept across the region. Those early days were a time of unbridled optimism. Dictators who had looked invulnerable fell, one after the other-in Tunisia, Egypt and, later, Libya and Yemen.
But revolution soon gave way to a sort of Thermidorian reaction. Egypt's brief experiment with democracy failed. Libya, Syria and Yemen plunged into civil war and became playgrounds for foreign powers. Wealthy Gulf states spent heavily to placate their own people and bolster anti-democratic forces elsewhere. The region is less free than it was in 2010-and worse off by most other measures, too.
Much has been said and written about what went wrong. In the West, pundits and policymakers tend to talk about themselves, what they could have done to help the revolutions succeed. There is a solipsism to these debates, which relegate Arabs to a secondary role in their own story. And counterfactuals are hard. It is plausible to argue that Syria would be less of a charnel house had America destroyed Bashar al-Assad's air force in 2012; far less to claim it would have become stable or prosperous or democratic. The no-fly zone over Libya in 2011 helped overthrow Muammar Qaddafi but did not prevent his country's ruin.
Cynics suggest that the Middle East is simply not suited for democracy. Yet Tunisia emerged from its revolt with a fragile but genuine republic, of which its citizens are justly proud.
There is no one answer to why things went wrong for the other countries that took part in the Arab spring. Blame foreign powers, from Iran and Russia to the impotent, incoherent West. Blame Islamists, who often stoked division in cynical bids for power. Most of all, though, blame the men who ruled Arab states after they gained independence in the 20th century. Though few were democrats, they understood something about democracy. It requires more than elections to succeed. It also needs engaged and informed citizens, a common set of rules and a shared belief that political disagreements do not pose an existential threat. Dictatorships, by design, lack these qualities-and prevent them from emerging.
Anyone who has spent time in the Middle East knows the region crackles with conspiracy theories. A non-trivial number of Egyptians believe that America put the Muslim Brotherhood in power (in fact, Egyptian voters did) or that Hillary Clinton created Islamic State. The popularity of such ideas is perhaps understandable. Schools in Egypt teach by rote; the government prefers placid subjects to engaged citizens. The media read from a script; a wayward word in a café or a Facebook post can land anyone in jail. It is hard to have a say in how you are governed in a system that tries to prevent it.
It can also seem futile in a system where governance is so poor. Arabs loathe the bribes and wasta, or connections, required to navigate daily life in much of the region. Yet to survive in such a system requires the tacit acceptance of its terms. Every act of graft, no matter how petty, undermines confidence in the state, in the very idea of a common good. Corruption makes everyone complicit. Mr Bouazizi struck a nerve because so many of his countrymen had been in his place.
Beyond futile, it can seem dangerous: people who think their countrymen wish them dead will not wish those countrymen to gain power. Mr Assad convinced many of his supporters that the Syrian uprising was the work of extremists. This was not prescience but self-fulfilling prophecy. Release enough jihadists from prison, murder enough moderates, starve the populace for long enough, and sooner or later a peaceful movement will become radical.
None of this is unique to the Middle East. America has an alarming level of polarisation and an outgoing president who lies reflexively. But robust institutions and centuries of democratic tradition make it virtually impossible for any American president to become a dictator. The Middle East has no such safeguards. For decades it has been ruled by visionless autocrats who promised only stability for stability's sake.
Today's crop of dictators, those who survived 2011 and those who emerged from it, speak a subtly different language, one that posits development, not democracy, as the region's most dire deficit. In their telling the focus on political change is misguided. What Arabs truly need is better governance and more job opportunities. Yet even on their own terms many rulers are failing. Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi talks of developing Egypt; most Egyptians have seen their standards of living deteriorate on his watch.
And like his counterparts, Mr Sisi is eagerly salting the earth lest any other revolutionary shoots take root. The tight political space of Hosni Mubarak's Egypt looks positively freewheeling compared with today's. In Algeria, a new army-backed regime is less interested in stamping out corruption than in wielding corruption charges as a cudgel against its foes. Bahrain's monarchy portrays criticism of its rule as an Iranian plot to colonise the island.
This is no era of authoritarian stability, though. With few exceptions the region is miserable, a mix of failed states and stagnant ones that offer meagre prospects for their young populations. Even in the Gulf states, which mostly dodged serious unrest in 2011, rulers are nervous about their future in the twilight of the oil age. Their old social contract offered material comfort in exchange for political quiescence. If they can no longer provide the former, they cannot long expect the latter.
History is not linear. Revolutions fail; bad guys sometimes win. There is no reason to expect that the next round of Arab uprisings will produce happier results than the previous one. Equally, though, there is no reason to believe the autocrats when they say they can prevent it. *"

The regime is as merciless as ever
Even by Iran's standards the justice was rough. Four days after sentence was passed, Ruhollah Zam was hanged. The judge said he had spied, incited violence and ""sown corruption on earth"". Most Iranians took that to mean that he had simply disagreed with the right of the ayatollahs to rule.
Mr Zam had been a remarkable dissident. In 2011he went to Paris to escape the regime and, four years later, launched Amad, a news channel on Telegram, a messaging app. At its peak Amad had more subscribers than the bbc's Persian service, which many Iranians rely on. He exposed the sexual and financial peccadilloes of the regime's top turbans. The son of an influential cleric and an alumnus of a school in Tehran, the capital, favoured by the elite, he had a wide web of contacts.
When nationwide protests erupted three years ago, he posted the place and time of rallies and was often first to get videos from the scene. He issued a manual for making petrol bombs. He called for regime change: ""Ruhollah began the revolution, Ruhollah will end it,"" he said, referring first to Ruhollah Khomeini, father of the Islamic revolution, then to himself. The regime blocked Telegram but failed to silence him. Then last year its agents lured him to Iraq, apparently with a honey trap, kidnapped him and took him home.
Mr Zam's treatment shows yet again that the regime will stop at nothing to crush civil society. Snipers shoot demonstrators. In September a prominent wrestler was hanged for joining a protest. The hardliners control parliament and the courts, so they can rig next year's presidential election.
Human-rights outfits in Europe warn Iranian dissidents abroad against travelling home. ""Zam is just the beginning,"" read a social-media message to an anchor at the bbc's Persian service in London. ""I always look over my shoulder when leaving the office,"" she says.
""Horrifying,"" tweeted Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden's choice for national security adviser. Yet the new administration's eagerness to curb Iran's enrichment of uranium may outweigh human rights. On December 16th the parties to the nuclear deal with Iran met on schedule. President Donald Trump pulled America out of the agreement. Mr Biden says he will rejoin it."

A peace deal between Morocco and Israel could lead to conflict elsewhere
Israel's formal ties with the Arab world now extend from the United Arab Emirates (uae) in the east to Morocco in the west. On December 10th President Donald Trump announced the latest breakthrough in his diplomatic push on behalf of the Jewish state. Morocco, the Arab world's oldest monarchy, will become the fourth Arab state in as many months to establish diplomatic relations with Israel (following the uae, Bahrain and Sudan).
The agreement is a win for Israel, and also for Morocco. As part of the deal, Mr Trump recognised Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara. The territory, slightly larger than Britain, is also claimed by the Polisario Front, a nationalist movement backed by Algeria. Mr Trump's intervention comes amid provocations by both sides that risk restarting a war that ended three decades ago.
That old conflict kicked off in 1975, when Morocco annexed Western Sahara after Spain, the colonial power, pulled out. Polisario, which the un considers the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, resisted-but was outgunned. With Morocco in control of about two-thirds of the territory, and Polisario controlling the other third, the un brokered a ceasefire deal in 1991 that promised the Sahrawis a referendum on independence. Morocco, though, stands in the way.
Morocco's treatment of the Sahrawis is in some ways like Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Over the years Morocco has used subsidies and tax breaks to convince thousands of its people to move to Western Sahara in an effort to cement its control. Sahrawi protests are suppressed; activists talk of torture by the security services. But the kingdom has also spent billions of dollars fixing up the territory.
Once of primarily symbolic value, Western Sahara's strategic value has been growing. The side held by Polisario has little in the way of resources. But the portion controlled by Morocco is rich in phosphates and fish. Large reserves of oil may lie offshore. The kingdom also sees Western Sahara as its gateway to west Africa, which buys up Moroccan exports.
So the kingdom is working hard to transform its de facto control of Western Sahara into something more legitimate. Over the past year it has convinced around 20 African and Arab states to recognise its claim. The un seems to have all but given up on overseeing the referendum. A un Security Council resolution in October extending the mandate of the UN's peacekeeping mission did not mention the vote, though it is called the un Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.
""Morocco's serious, credible and realistic autonomy proposal is the ONLY basis for a just and lasting solution for enduring peace and prosperity!"" tweeted Mr Trump, referring to a proposal Polisario does not feel is serious or credible. ""Morocco recognized the United States in 1777. It is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the Western Sahara."" Indeed, both acts neglected the opinion of the indigenous population. President-elect Joe Biden could adopt a more even-handed approach.
Inside Morocco, the king's decision to normalise relations with Israel is controversial. Many Islamists and leftists oppose the move. But most Moroccans seem to consider America's recognition of the kingdom's claim over Western Sahara more important than the kingdom's recognition of Israel. They have long called for putting their needs before those of the Palestinians. A popular slogan, ""Taza before Gaza"", refers to cities in Morocco and Palestine.
The Sahrawis pose a bigger risk. In October Sahrawi protesters closed the UN-patrolled border crossing at Guerguerat (see map). The area is meant to act as a buffer zone, but Morocco sent in troops to quell the unrest. That enraged Brahim Ghali, leader of Polisario. In November he abandoned the ceasefire and claimed a series of attacks around the 2,700km (1,700-mile) sand berm, built by the Moroccan army, that separates the two sides.
Whether things escalate further depends, in part, on Algeria. It competes with Morocco for access to markets and may see a benefit in the trouble around Guerguerat. But Mr Trump's deal has it worried. American and Israeli support, warn Algerian generals, might embolden Morocco at a time when Algeria is economically weak and politically unstable. Algeria's prime minister, Abdelaziz Djerad, warns of a ""real threat on our borders, reached by the Zionist entity"".
Some of this may be an effort by Algerian leaders to divert attention from problems at home. But they have the backing of Russia, which criticised America for acting unilaterally on Western Sahara. The manoeuvring of local players and foreign powers is pushing the situation into dangerous territory. Whether or not Mr Trump's deal lowers tensions in the Holy Land, it is raising them in the Sahara. *"

ABUJA
Another mass abduction, this time near the president's holiday home
On December liTH Nigeria's president, Muhammadu Buhari, flew off to take a holiday at his country home in Daura, an ancient seat of Islamic learning in the northern state of Katsina. That night hundreds of gunmen riding on motorbikes stormed a boarding school in Kankara, also in Katsina state. Some schoolboys jumped over a fence and ran away when they heard gunshots. But more than 300 were rounded up and herded into the surrounding forest. One who later escaped told the bbc they were beaten, threatened and forced to walk through the night.
It was not immediately clear who the culprits were. Nigeria's government says that the children were taken by bandits who have demanded a ransom for their release. But Boko Haram, a jihadist group, said it was behind the kidnapping. Both explanations are plausible.
Criminal gangs in Nigeria have long ? been experts at ""express kidnaps"", in which wealthy locals and foreigners are grabbed at gunpoint and held until cash is handed over or their bank accounts are emptied through atms. In the past few years such gangs have become less discriminating, grabbing thousands of poor folk, including travellers on buses or people living in villages (see map). In some places they have demanded levies from farmers before they allow them to harvest their crops.
Moreover, this is not the first mass abduction by bandits in the president's home state. Twenty-six girls kidnapped in October in another town in Katsina were freed after a ransom was paid. They said the kidnappers raped and beat them. Even so, the latest attack would suggest a hitherto unseen level of brazenness by bandits.
The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, offered no proof that his group was behind the kidnapping when he claimed responsibility on December 15th. (After earlier mass kidnappings Boko Haram provided photos or videos of the victims.) Some security experts therefore wondered if this was just a publicity stunt.
In 2014 Boko Haram gained the world's attention by kidnapping nearly 300 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in the northeastern state of Borno, which is at the heart of Nigeria's jihadist insurgency. In 2018 it snatched more than 100 girls from a boarding school in Dapchi, in neighbouring Yobe state, a move that intelligence officials said demonstrated its ability to mount sophisticated raids over long distances.
If the jihadists carried out the latest outrage, it would mark a big extension of the group's reach and a deterioration of security across northern Nigeria, because Kankara is more than 700km by road from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno, where Boko Haram emerged. It is also just a few hours' drive from Mr Buhari's home in Daura. Yet days after the attack the president had not seen fit to interrupt his holiday and make the short journey to the school, where parents of the kidnapped boys have been camped, anxiously waiting for news. *"

LUHIHI
The real money is in selling services to miners
It is not yet noon but the streets of Luhihi, a tiny town in eastern Congo, are already full of revellers. Men fall about outside bars filled with prostitutes. Gamblers hover over draughtboards. Music blares from a makeshift club near the river where miners sift through mud for gold.
The precious metal was found in Luhihi in May. Artisan miners came rushing in from far and wide. A street of pop-up bars, brothels, shops and gambling dens has sprung up to cater to them. Many of the entrepreneurs running such businesses rove from mine to mine, moving on when the minerals dry up or rebels march into town. For two decades dozens of militias have fought over gold, tin and coltan mines in eastern Congo.
Bertun Mupenda, who runs a nightclub in Luhihi, first set up a bar at a gold-rush town elsewhere in South Kivu province. He left when it was plundered by rebels for a second time. ""Seven of them came in the night with guns,"" he says. ""They beat up my workers, stole my beers and asked us for all the money we had."" Mr Mupenda had to hand over more than $2,000.
Luhihi is fairly safe, partly because it does not seem to have a huge gold deposit. The hill that looms over the town is pockmarked with tunnels. Frustrated men wearing head torches climb out of them, dragging sacks of mud and mumbling that they have not seen gold in weeks. Still, the miners seem keen to spend whatever earnings they have in town.
""The money is good,"" says Jeanette Albertine, who runs a bar selling local brews made from fermented bananas and maize. ""But I do not feel comfortable here."" Drunk clients try to grope her. They also get into brawls in her bar. She often has to call for help from local policemen, who then demand cash for chasing disorderly customers away. But Ms Albertine is used to such problems: she has spent the past decade moving between gold and coltan mines across North and South Kivu provinces. She earns about $10 a day, far more than she used to make as a farmer.
Luhihi also boasts a string of new hotels made from wood and tarpaulins where local gold traders stay. One miner grumbles that they do not give fair prices and that their scales are weighted to make the gold seem lighter than it really is. He adds that he does not know where the traders take the gold. Much probably goes to Uganda. Gold worth $300m-600m is smuggled out of Congo each year, estimates the Sentry, an American watchdog.
Many miners risk their lives in shaky tunnels because there are few other ways to earn a living. Most of them are still extremely poor. Luhihi's makeshift bars may heave with clients, but many are there to drown their sorrows rather than celebrate. ""Life in the mines is tough,"" explains Ms Albertine, forgivingly. ""People drink to help them relax."" *"

Workers from rich countries are returning home
When Jakarta went into lockdown in April Asian Tigers Group, a moving company, received a flurry of business from wealthy expatriates who had fled overnight. Removal teams were led into deserted homes by maids or colleagues. Without the owners on hand to sort belongings, they found themselves stripping beds and packing dirty sheets into boxes alongside broken toys and other junk.
All the expats who want to move away have now done so and there are few new arrivals. Asian Tigers is laying off staff for the first time in its 35-year history. ""Unless the tap turns back on we're in a tough spot,"" says Bill Lloyd, head of the group's Indonesian operations.
Asian metropolises have long attracted migrants from the rich world. Fast-growing businesses, vast natural resources and unfamiliar commercial environments make for interesting work. Meanwhile, living costs are low, so expats can afford maids and big houses that would be out of reach back home. Around 3m migrants from the oecd were living in Asia last year, according to data from the club, which is composed mostly of rich countries, up from 2.3m in 1990. But the pandemic has underlined the drawbacks of living abroad, including distance from family and (in some places) a lack of good medical facilities. Unlike most immigrants, these are a well-off lot for whom relocation is a choice. Many have raced home rather than weather the pandemic in a foreign country.
That is a loss for both their home and host countries. People moving from the developed world to emerging markets make up a tiny portion of the world's 270m international migrants. But they play an outsized role in the global economy, bringing new ideas and cosmopolitan connections wherever they go. A study in Canada found that a 10% increase in migrants from a given country is associated with a 1% increase in exports to that country and a 3% increase in imports from it. There is no reason why migration to developing economies should not produce similar benefits, says Amanda Klekowski von Koppenfels of the University of Kent. ""We rarely think of the global North as a region that gains from emigration but it absolutely does,"" she says. ""This is a small but powerful movement.""
However, covid-19 has diminished the appeal of living abroad for many in the rich world. Iñigo Lumbreras de Mazarredo spent much of his 20s working his way up the ranks at a food-delivery firm in Asia. The best thing about expat life, he says, was the opportunity to travel widely and meet new people. After a stressful couple of weeks trying to pack up and go home, including four cancelled flights, the 29-yearold returned from Cambodia to Spain in April. ""The main point of going abroad is to have an experience,"" he explains. ""Now that isn't an option.""
Data are patchy on migration in Asia, but all the evidence points to a mass exodus. By June America had repatriated more than 15,000 of its citizens from the continent, including both tourists and migrants. Knight Frank, a multinational estate agent, has seen a big rise in expats ? looking to buy a base in their home country, particularly among those with elderly parents or children at boarding school back home. In a survey in June roughly 30% of the group's agents said these clients were planning to move permanently and 60% said they wanted to split their time between their original and adoptive homes.
For employers, the pandemic has accentuated the disadvantages of hiring pricey Westerners in Asia. Most countries have introduced quarantine rules and stalled visa applications, making it difficult to get people where they are supposed to be going. Eliminating expensive foreign postings is an easy way to save money in a recession. Meanwhile, the need to work from home has shown that colleagues can collaborate reasonably well at a great distance using video-calling. More than 50% of businesses have repatriated employees on long-term assignments abroad and only half of them expect to move them back within a year, according to a survey by eca International, which helps firms relocate staff. Almost all the companies surveyed also said they were allowing expats to work from other places if they wanted to.
Covid-19 is accelerating a trend that was already under way, says Toby Fowlston of Robert Walters, a recruiting firm. Education and language skills across the region have improved markedly in recent years. There is much less need to fly in expats to get a job done. In Hong Kong, Mr Fowlston says, the growing influence of mainland China means that employers are looking for Mandarin-speakers. He estimates that expats occupy just a fifth of client-facing roles at investment banks in the city, down from a third five years ago.
Host governments are also obstructing the hiring of expats, imagining that this might reduce unemployment. In Malaysia firms can employ foreigners only if they cannot find a local applicant who fits the bill. Employers have to advertise jobs through a central portal, interview candidates within 30 days and report back to the authorities afterwards. In August the Singaporean government raised the minimum wage businesses have to pay foreigners to secure a visa. It also launched an investigation into 47 firms that, it suspects, have not given local applicants a fair shot. In a similar vein, several Asian countries say they will cancel the residence permits of foreigners who leave the country without obtaining special permission first.
Whether businesses and governments want them or not, there will always be Westerners eager to live in Asia. Most people move either for love or for work. The first group is not that flighty. For the second, the appeal of expatriate life is likely to return when borders reopen and socialdistancing rules fall away.
Hector Drake and his wife recently moved to London to have their first child after a decade in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. If anything, Mr Drake says, the pandemic has revealed what a desirable place to live Asia is. The governments of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam have done a far better job than most in the West of keeping the virus under control. The couple caught covid-19 shortly after returning to Britain. Mr Drake may put more thought into his health insurance next time, but he hopes to work abroad again. ""People will chase opportunities if they are there,"" he says. *"

YANGON
Conservationists are racing to save crumbling colonial buildings
Since Myanmar began to reverse decades of isolationism in 2011, it has embraced modernity with a zeal befitting a country deprived of it for so long. Students tap smartphones, food-delivery jockeys zip down the streets and cash machines are everywhere. But while the people of Yangon, the country's biggest city and commercial capital, are rushing into the present, much of the urban fabric remains firmly in the past. Most buildings in the city centre were built in the colonial era, when Rangoon, as the city was then known, was the biggest commercial hub of the British empire between Singapore and Calcutta (as it was). Indian merchants, Armenian hoteliers, Filipino barbers and Saudi tobacco-dealers set up shop or took up residence in stately Victorian, Edwardian and Art Deco buildings.
Myanmar's subsequent economic stagnation left Yangon with more colonial buildings than any other city in South-East Asia. But the grand edifices were neglected during the long years of military rule, and most are now streaked with mould. Red signs affixed to rotting doors mark many out as unfit for habitation. They are not beyond repair: a stone's throw from the shimmering Sule Pagoda in the centre of the city stands the Tourist Burma building, a former office and department store spattered with pediments and pilasters. Once derelict, it was renovated by Burmese and British ngos and reopened as a community centre in 2019.
One of the ngos involved was the Yangon Heritage Trust (yht), founded by Thant Myint-U in 2012. As the military regime began to reform the economy a decade ago, Mr Thant, a historian, worried that the government would raze Yangon's architectural inheritance in the name of progress, as has happened in so many other booming Asian cities. So he began to advocate for the preservation of colonial Yangon, arguing that the spruced-up buildings would not only draw tourists but also make Yangon more appealing for its residents.
The municipal government quickly saw the light, perhaps because Mr Thant was friendly with the president. In 2012 it imposed a 50-year moratorium on the demolition of buildings more than 50 years old. Although Mr Thant worries that the city has yet to develop ""a coherent vision and plan for what Yangon should be"", it does see the value in conservation, he says. Moreover, it is ""in pretty much daily contact"" with yht, which has helped with some 350 conservation projects. Several other organisations also provide expertise or funding for renovations, among them Turquoise Mountain, a British charity which worked on the Tourist Burma building.
But finding wealthy foreigners to help 1 ? renovate urban landmarks is one thing; fixing up crumbling private residences is quite another. Many of the 15,000 buildings in Yangon that yht wants preserved are residential, and in serious disrepair. Moe Thida, a shopkeeper and lifelong resident of downtown Yangon, has no qualms about demolition. By all means preserve Bagan, the site of an ancient Burman kingdom and Myanmar's most famous tourist destination, she says, but in a residential neighbourhood houses should not be ""dangerous to live in"". She is far more comfortable living in her newish apartment building than she was in her parents' 1940s wreck.
But even if new buildings are nice at first, Mr Thant argues, they do not remain so for long. In Myanmar most are poorly constructed and weather badly. Colonial stock tends to be better designed and sturdier, says Nathalie Paarlberg of Turquoise Mountain. The lime-mortar walls of the Tourism Burma building withstand tropical heat and moisture better than concrete, which is more commonly used today.
Renovations are costly, but financing is available for home-owners. Doh Eain, a charitable enterprise, renovates homes in return for a cut of the revenue generated by renting out the refurbished property, typically for five to ten years. ""Owners say to us, 'We didn't realise that we owned something that is valuable,'"" says Emilie Röell, Doh Eain's founder. ""We help them see that."" Not everyone needs to be told. For every Moe Thida, there is a Sithu Maung. A young mp, he lives in a late 19th-century building that the government has deemed dangerous. But he hopes his house will be preserved. ""Old buildings have their unique beauty"", he says, ""and that makes the city also unique."" *"

When it comes to voicing demands, India's 150m farmers are not shy. Recent protests have seen throngs of them descend on the national capital to express desperation by, among other things, stripping naked, being buried alive, displaying skulls (allegedly of fellow farmers who have killed themselves in despair), and even by eating rats and human faeces.
This year's biggest agitation has relied on numbers and grit, not telegenic antics. Since late November tens of thousands of farmers have camped at Delhi's northern gates, bringing tractors, animals, bedding and industrial-scale soup kitchens. Having failed to disperse this horde with tear-gas and water cannon, police, too, have settled in behind a defence of trenches, iron railings and rows of shipping containers. The protesters have a simple demand: repeal three farm laws that Narendra Modi, the prime minister, rushed through parliament in September.
Agronomists and economists generally welcome those reforms. Many farmers, too, agree that laws dating from the 1950s and 1960s, an era of scarcity and state socialism, need updating if Indian agriculture is to compete in an age of global markets. Mr Modi's measures end the monopoly enjoyed by state-controlled wholesale markets, axe ""antihoarding"" rules that scare off investment in, for example, cold storage, and ease, among other things, long-term contracts between farmers and customers.
But the musty laws and institutions so disliked by experts have, in fact, served one constituency rather well. Growers across much of India have tended to vary crops and rely little on government, but farmers in its grain belt, which happens to stretch across the plains north and west of Delhi, have grown ever more dependent. Pumping unlimited groundwater using free governmentsupplied electricity, planting subsidised seeds and spreading subsidised fertiliser, farmers in the states of Punjab and Haryana produce the bulk of the rice and wheat that the government spends around $25bn every year buying at a guaranteed price for the sake of ""food security"". They grow so much that, although India exports more rice than any other country, and the government sells it on the cheap to some 810m of its own citizens, by June it had accumulated a massive 97m-tonne mountain of the stuff.
Such policies are plainly not sustainable, yet the risk-free farming cycle has proved addictive to the growers who profit most. In the 1970s rice and wheat took up less than half of Punjab's farmland. They now swallow four-fifths. As with any addiction, this one comes with unhealthy disadvantages, including depleted groundwater, poisoned soil and toxic air from the burning of rice stubble.
After huge gains in living standards from the 1960s to the 1990s, when the ""green revolution"" tripled or quadrupled grain yields, growth has stagnated. Farmers worry about job prospects for their children, who are better educated than they are. They fear a loss in status as earnings from their land-Punjabi farms are bigger than elsewhere in India, but still average less than four hectares-fail to keep pace with urban wages.
Yet much as Punjabi farmers dream of change, they also fear any shift in the policies that sustain them. They know the government will some day lose its penchant for dishing out subsidies, and it is not illogical to suspect that day may be now, amid a raging pandemic and economic crash. Mr Modi, who has pledged to double farmers' incomes in five years, failed to take this doubt into account. Rather than consult powerful farming unions, or build support for the bills in parliament, his government used its majority to ram them into law without discussion. When the protests erupted, his ministers made things worse, sneering that the angry farmers were stupid, swayed by ""anti-national"" leftists or, since many are Sikhs, were dangerous separatists, perhaps terrorists.
Mr Modi's government has offered minor concessions, to no avail. It can still save face by temporarily suspending the laws. As with countless other protests in India, this one may also simply dissolve. Divine intervention ended last year's nationwide protests against a discriminatory citizenship law, which petered out with the arrival of covid-19. However the siege of Delhi ends, India's rulers would be wise to learn its lessons: in such a diverse and noisy country, you cannot make one rule for all, and you cannot make rules at all without first winning people to your cause."

Sexual harassment
Xianzi was an intern at China's national television network when she visited the dressing room of Zhu Jun, a presenter, in 2014. She wanted to interview him to gather information for a project at her university. Once they were alone, she says, he groped and kissed her. When she later complained to the police, they told her not to sue him because it would reflect badly on the Communist Party. Mr Zhu is a household name. His jobs have included hosting China's annual new-year gala, the world's most-watched television show.
Four years later the #MeToo campaign, which had been spreading elsewhere in the world, began to inspire women in China to publicise their experiences of sexual harassment. Xianzi (a pseudonym by which she is always known in China) wrote about her alleged mistreatment and became the movement's best-known face in the country. Mr Zhu denied the accusation and sued Xianzi for defamation. She counter-sued, demanding an apology and payment of 50,000 yuan ($7,600) in damages.
The government is wary of #MeToo activism, fearful that it might morph into political dissent. It suppressed media coverage of the dispute. On December 2nd, however, the first court hearing into Xianzi's suit thrust her back into the limelight. It produced no new insights-Mr Zhu failed to appear and the case was adjourned, probably until 2021. But on Weibo, a social-media platform, posts with a hashtag related to the launch of the court proceedings attracted more than 17m views and thousands of comments.
That the #MeToo cause is still alive in China was also evident outside the court in Beijing. Despite the presence of numerous police, and a political climate that discourages all but the brave or foolhardy from demonstrating in public, more than 100 people gathered in support of Xianzi (a few are pictured, with the plaintiff in the foreground). Some waved pictures of rice and rabbits, the Mandarin for which sounds like the English words ""me too"". A slogan displayed by one group said: ""Together we demand an answer from history.""
Since Xianzi went public with her allegation, she says she has received tens of thousands of messages from women across the country sharing their own experiences of being sexually harassed and assaulted. Many women in China have also made public allegations of sexual assault against powerful men. The accused include academics, media personalities, charity bosses and religious figures (few have dared to point fingers at officials).
In 2018 China's highest court made it clear for the first time that sexual harassment could be grounds for suing. But it is remarkable that Xianzi's case has got this far. Women who are victims of sexual assault in China face tremendous obstacles to fighting in court. Financial costs are high. Most lawyers and ngos in China lack expertise in this rarely explored area of law. Victims who go public are often subjected to online abuse by men who oppose feminism and #MeToo. As Xianzi puts it, they face an ""extremely hostile system"".
Many aspects of the system in China are ? heavily skewed in favour of men, not least in employment and family matters. The World Economic Forum places China above South Korea and Japan in its ranking of countries by gender equality. But since Xi Jinping became China's leader in 2012 his country has fallen from 69 th to 106th on that list, below Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Despite this, more women than ever in China are gaining degrees. In 2009, for the first time, the number of female undergraduates surpassed those who were male. Since then women have retained this majority. Young highly educated women have been at the forefront of China's #MeToo movement. Their demands for rights as women are ""very difficult to suppress"", says Wang Zheng of the University of Michigan.
The Communist Party accuses ""hostile foreign forces"" of stoking such advocacy. In 2015 police arrested a group of women merely for planning to hand out stickers about sexual harassment on public transport. The ""feminist five"", as they became known, were released only after weeks in prison, and after news of their plight had sparked outrage in China and abroad. When visiting the state-backed All-China Women's Federation in 2018, President Xi said the organisation ""absolutely must not become one of those organisations like they have in other countries for feminists or posh women"".
Though stifled by the government, campaigning has made some impact. ""Prior to #MeToo, discussions about women and gender in mainstream media and on social media were quite limited,"" says Zhang Zhiqi, the host of a podcast popular among feminists in China. ""There's now a lot more awareness about gender equality and I think that's due to #MeToo.""
A new civil code, which will take effect on January 1st, requires employers to prevent sexual harassment at work. Many feminists call this a success for their efforts to publicise the problem. ""We've seen some real progress made in recent years in China's legal sphere to better protect women's rights, although it is becoming extremely difficult for feminist ngos to operate,"" says Feng Yuan of Equality, a Beijing-based group promoting women's rights.
Xianzi is not optimistic that she will win her case (and Mr Zhu's against her is still pending). But she says even defeat would be ""victory"" because her suit has helped to raise awareness of sexual assault. As night fell outside the court and the temperature dropped below freezing, people following her case online began sending anonymous donations of bubble tea, hamburgers, fried chicken, noodles, hand sanitiser, gloves and taxi money to supporters still gathered there. When couriers arrived with the deliveries, they read out the intended recipient, asking ""Who is 'Xianzi's friend'?"" The crowd replied: ""We all are."" *"

NEW YORK
Sensing change in Washington, China is mustering allies at the UN
WHEN AMERICA withdrew from the un Human Rights Council in 2018, China expressed regret. No one bought it. The forum deals with a topic that is a huge potential embarrassment for China. The absence of the world's most powerful democracy from its deliberations made it likelier that China's abuses would escape censure. But with Joe Biden preparing to take over as America's president, China fears trouble ahead. It is girding its loins in the council.
Evidence of this can be detected in a shadowy feud over who should lead the Geneva-based body. It involves an attempt by China-backed by Russia and Saudi Arabia-to nobble the presumed front-runner for control of the presidency, the tiny Pacific island nation of Fiji, and manoeuvre a country more to its liking into that position. (China and Russia were not on the council in 2020, but will be from January 1st.) Democratic members of the council, hoping that Mr Biden will soon send America to rejoin them, see this as an important battle. They are supporting Fiji.
The question of who leads the council may seem trifling. After all, it is the body's 47 members, not its president, who set the agenda. And members have been loth to challenge China. The council has yet even to introduce a resolution, much less pass one, on China's mass internment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang or its stripping of Hong Kong's freedoms. The Trump administration pulled America out after failing to persuade the UN to impose standards for membership of the council.
But the president does have leeway in the appointment of special rapporteurs, who have much autonomy and can be thorns in the side of authoritarian regimes. In June more than 50 special rapporteurs and experts appointed by the council signed a statement chiding China for violating rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. China was furious. It accused the signatories of breaching the un charter.
The council's next leader will also play a big role in a five-year review of its work by the un General Assembly. This could result in reforms wanted by America, such as setting criteria for membership.
Crucially, the appointment of a president from a country with an appalling human-rights reputation could cause even greater damage to the council's already underwhelming image in the West. In 2003 the council's predecessor body, the un Commission on Human Rights, elected Libya to its chairmanship. This contributed to its dissolution three years later. Were something similar to happen again, it may become difficult for Mr Biden to endorse America's return to the council.
That would be a victory for China, which sees the organisation as a beachhead in its campaign to redefine global norms. It has used it to secure resolutions that weaken the language of human rights, emphasising state-led development over the rights of individuals, and respectful ""dialogue"" between states rather than holding countries to account when they commit abuses. It has also vigorously opposed resolutions against specific states, arguing that countries should not interfere in others' affairs. China's voice in the council, whether as an observer or a member, helps it to counter its growing band of critics. In October, 39 un members signed a statement condemning the horrors in Xinjiang, up from 23 who did so a year earlier. The number who signed a statement defending China fell from more than 50 to 45.
In 2021 the presidency is supposed to be held by a member of the UN's Asia-Pacific group, to which Fiji and China belong (the regions take turns). Fiji's representative is widely respected for her stance on human rights. She had been running unopposed. But in November Bahrain formally made a bid for the job. Syria then objected to Fiji's candidacy. Diplomats say these moves were encouraged by China and its friends. Later a third contender, also acceptable to China, emerged: Uzbekistan. Fiji and its Pacific-island neighbours felt bullied.
But Asia-Pacific countries have failed to agree on a choice. So the council's full membership may pick a president in January. That could work in Fiji's favour, and, Western envoys hope, to the betterment of the UN's human-rights efforts."

The covid-19 pandemic has hit waste-pickers in various ways; those who are better organised have done best
KAMPALA, LUSAKA, MUMBAI, SĀO PAULO AND YANGON
AT THE NORTHERN edge of Lusaka, in Zambia, the 24-hectare Chunga landfill smoulders in the midday sun, its sour smoke scalding the nose and throat. Wesley Kambizi works nine-hour days on the dump with just a beanie and mismatched sneakers for protection: one slip-on, one lace-up, both caked in mud. Local authorities intermittently threaten to bar waste-pickers like him from the site. Worsening poverty in the city means both that more people are scavenging at the landfill and that fewer valuable scraps make it there in the first place.
The world's cities produce over 2bn tonnes of solid waste every year. Even before the covid-19 pandemic local governments in poor countries struggled to keep their streets clean, clearing less than half the rubbish in urban areas and around a quarter in the countryside. Informal workers, who make up around 80% of the 19m-24m workers in the waste industry, have helped plug that gap. They both haul rubbish and scour municipal dumps and public spaces for things which can be reused or sold, normally through middlemen, to recycling companies. In India waste-pickers divert over 40m tonnes of refuse away from landfills and into recycling every year, a task that would cost municipalities 15-20% of their annual budget. In South Africa they are responsible for recovering 80-90% of packaging.
Some, like Mr Kambizi, do the job full-time; others resort to waste-picking only when times are hard. The pandemic has enlarged their ranks. Birungi Hidaya lost her job as a teacher in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, soon after the pandemic struck. Now she works the Kiteezi landfill. She turns her nose up at the other scavengers on the dump, labelling them ""ignorant"" and ""not civilised at all"".
The lay-offs that have come with the pandemic have seen more people like Ms Birungi eking out a living by collecting, sorting and selling rubbish. But the pandemic has also created new problems for waste-pickers.
The first is getting to the waste. South Africa failed to classify waste-picking as an essential service during this year's lockdowns, leaving thousands stuck at home at risk of starvation. In Accra and Kumasi, cities in Ghana, those who live off the landfills worry that local governments will use the pandemic as an excuse to decommission the dumps, something they have long aspired to do.
Panicked citizens make matters worse. In Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, Thiha used to make 500,000 kyat ($370) every month as an independent waste-collector in a working-class area. When a second wave of covid-19 hit in early September people began erecting makeshift barricades around their neighbourhoods, denying him access. His earnings fell by a third.
It is not just the people who are keeping Mr Thiha from the rubbish. The pandemic is producing a lot more medical waste. The amount of it produced in China's Hubei province increased by 370% after the outbreak began. Manila and Jakarta are expected to produce an extra 280 and 210 tonnes every day, respectively. The Yangon City Development Committee (ycdc) is struggling to keep this sort of dangerous refuse away from the public in general and people like Mr Thiha in particular. It has been tasked with collecting, separating and burning the 50 tonnes of rubbish produced by hospitals and quarantine centres every day. (The sad duty of cremating victims of covid-19 has also fallen to the ycdc. ""That's a different job and also a stressful job for my people,"" sighs Aung Myint Maw, deputy director of the sanitation department.)
Such care reflects a genuine concern. Some of the proliferation of pandemic-associated waste has been a benefit to litter-pickers-think of all those tiddly little bottles of hand sanitiser. But in poor cities that lack the infrastructure to segregate medical waste it can be a real problem.
Scientists believe covid-19 is transmitted via tiny droplets that people exhale as they breathe, talk and cough. These virus particles can remain infective after a day spent on cardboard, at least two days on steel and three on plastic. Rifling through rubbish is never particularly safe from a health point of view; this year's influx of infected material makes the business even riskier, particularly for those without personal protective equipment (ppe) and little understanding of how the disease spreads.
The falling price of recyclables presents a third problem. The formal recycling industry ground to a halt when countries closed their borders, making it impossible to ferry waste to the big plants which process it. There are fewer end-buyers for the plastic, paper and metal that scavengers collect. Data from the city of Pune in India show the price of polyethylene terephthalate, the plastic used to make water bottles, has dropped to as little as 10 rupees ($0.01) per kilogram from 22 rupees before the pandemic (see chart). Cardboard is two rupees per kilogram, half what it was.
That has been devastating for Rani Shivsharan, who has been collecting waste in Pune for over 25 years. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's signature Swacch Bharat, or Clean India, mission, the local authority does not recognise her work. Ms Shivsharan has not received any cash transfers or food rations since covid struck. There are days when she survives on tea. ""I am scared, but what can I do?"" she asks.
Brothers and sisters
Organised waste-pickers are better off on all three counts. A survey of 140 wastepicking associations in Brazil found that after serious disruption in the first weeks and months of the pandemic, three-quarters were back in operation by May. Almost all of them were using ppe, almost 80% had sent vulnerable members into isolation and 45% were quarantining scrap before sorting it. In Belo Horizonte, in south-eastern Brazil, a waste-pickers' co-operative successfully lobbied the mayor's office for food baskets and hygiene kits to see them through the pandemic.
The Belo Horizonte association had learned to fight for its members well before the pandemic. It has been almost 20 years since a group of single mothers in the city started collecting plastic bottles. The cooperative has since won a contract with the local authorities, which pays 265 reais ($52) for each tonne of material they sort. Similar stories can be told all round the continent. Waste-workers in Latin American cities like Buenos Aires, Bogotá and Sāo Paulo often operate in co-operatives. The fact that Latin America's litter-pickers are better organised and better treated is not just a by-product of increased regional prosperity. It is also the result of pressure brought by the waste-pickers themselves and a strong social-justice movement supported by the Roman Catholic church.
This has seen waste-pickers achieve a formal recognition they lack in many cities in Africa. Brazil has been gathering data on the sector for almost 20 years, from the time when waste-picking became an occupation listed in the national registry. Argentina legalised waste-picking in 2002 and has since created a government agency dedicated to the sector: it has a multimillion-dollar budget. Working together, waste-pickers can lobby for contracts or invest in sheds where they sort the day's harvest and store it until traders offer a good price. The many local names for collectors reflect a sometimes sophisticated division of labour. Cirujas, cartoneros, recicladores and chatarreros may each differ in responsibility and status city by city. By no means all of those who work on the dumps are in associations. But the successes of those who are often help those who are not, too.
None of this has been easy, says Martha Chen, a Harvard lecturer who advises Wiego, a non-profit focused on women in informal work. ""Someone from the public or the government doesn't wake up one morning and think: 'Let's think about the waste-pickers',"" she says. ""These gains come from years and years of struggle.""
Other regions aren't going to integrate informal workers into their waste-management systems overnight. But there is one way in which covid-19 might help them do their work and do it safely. In the midst of a public-health emergency, city folk across the globe have begun to appreciate those who put themselves at risk to keep the streets clean. India, with its entrenched caste system, has treated its waste-workers particularly badly in the past. But this year households in Pune have been handing out food packages and cash bonuses to the people who collect their rubbish. It is the same story on the streets of London, where children have adorned their windows with notes of thanks. Rainbows, hearts and smiley faces are dedicated to doctors, postal workers and binmen."

NEW YORK
American and European oil giants are making divergent strategic bets on the future of energy. Neither approach is foolproof
EXXONMOBIL, ONCE the world's most valuable publicly traded oil company, is not easily swayed. As green investors urged it to develop cleaner energy, it planned instead to pump 25% more oil and gas by 2025. As rivals wrote down billions of dollars in assets, it said its own reserves were unaffected. But in the maelstrom of 2020 even mighty Exxon had to budge. On November 30th it announced a write-down of between $17bn and $20bn, and cuts to capital spending of up to a third in 2022-25, implicitly scrapping its production goal. On December 14th it pledged to cut carbon emissions from operations, if only per unit of energy produced, by as much as 20% within five years.
These declarations are a sign that pressure on ExxonMobil is mounting. It lost half its market value between January and November. Investors have gripes beyond covid-19. In May BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, supported a motion to relieve Darren Woods, ExxonMobil's chief executive, of his duties as chairman. In December D.E. Shaw, a hedge fund, sent the firm a letter demanding capital discipline to protect its dividend. New York's state pension fund, America's third-largest, is considering divesting from the riskiest fossil-fuel firms. California State Teachers Retirement System (CalsTRS), the second-largest public pension fund, backs a campaign to replace nearly half of ExxonMobil's board. ""It's critical to their survival that they change,"" says Christopher Ailman, CalsTRS' chief investment officer.
Still, Mr Woods hangs on to both jobs. And, for all its latest pronouncements, his firm is betting on its old business, even as European rivals seek to reinvent themselves for a climate-friendlier era. This points to a widening transatlantic rift, as the world's oil giants try to win back investors after a year when demand for crude collapsed and its future became murkier. Each approach is riddled with risk.
Supermajors' returns have mostly been middling for years. In the decade to 2014 they overspent, furiously chasing production growth. As shale transformed the oil market from one of assumed scarcity to one of obvious abundance, many struggled to adapt. The return on capital employed for the top five Western firms-ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, bp and Total-sank by an average of three-quarters between 2008 and 2019. In 2019 energy was the worst-performing sector in the s&p 500 index of big American firms, as it had been in 2014, 2015 and 2018.
The past 12 months brought new indignities. All told, the big five have lost $350bn in stockmarket value. They talk of slashing jobs, by up to 15%, and capital spending. Shell cut its dividend for the first time since the second world war. bp said it would sell its posh headquarters in London's Mayfair. In August ExxonMobil was knocked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after nearly a century in the index. Energy firms' share of the s&p 500 fell below 3%, from a high-water mark of 13% in 2011.
In 2021a covid-19 vaccine will eventual- ly support demand for petrol and jet fuel- but no one knows how quickly. Leaders of the world's two biggest oil markets, China and America, have made it clear they want to curb emissions, but not when or by how much. Petrostates such as Russia and the United Arab Emirates are keen to defend their market share and wary of sustained production cuts that may boost American shale by inflating prices. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in December to raise output modestly in January, but declined to promise further price support.
Further out, expectations vary hugely. Legal & General Investment Management, an asset manager, reckons that keeping global warming within 2°C of preindustrial temperatures may halve oil demand in ten years. That is unlikely, but highlights risks to oil firms. While bp thinks demand may already have peaked, ExxonMobil has expected it to climb until at least 2040, supported by rising incomes and population.
Given all the uncertainty and underperformance, the question is not why investors would flee big oil. It is why they wouldn't. The answer, for now, is dividends. Morgan Stanley, a bank, reckons the ability to cover payouts explains some 80% of the variation in firms' valuations. That is a reason why those in America, which have resisted dividend cuts, are valued more highly relative to cashflow than European ones, which succumbed (see chart).
Well-laid plans
Shareholder returns in the next 5-10 years will be determined by two factors, reckons Michele Della Vigna of Goldman Sachs, another bank: cost-cutting and the management of the old business. Take Chevron, ExxonMobil's American rival. It has some low-carbon investments but no pretence of becoming a green giant. ""We have been pretty clear that we are not going to diversify away or divest from our core business,"" Pierre Breber, its finance chief, affirmed in October. Its low-cost oilfields pump out cash. A $5bn takeover of Noble Energy, a shale firm, will help it consolidate holdings in the Permian basin, which sprawls from west Texas to New Mexico. Morgan Stanley expects Chevron to generate $4.7bn of free cashflow in 2020.
This path is not risk-free. If oil demand declines more rapidly than the companies anticipate, they might struggle with a rising cost of capital and stiff competition from the likes of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's oil colossus, or its Emirati counterparts. ExxonMobil shows the danger of spending too much on fossil fuels and losing sight of returns. Its free cashflow in 2020 is already negative. The alternative, embraced by European firms, is to increase the efficiency of the legacy business while venturing into new areas.
The challenge for that model, says Muqsit Ashraf of Accenture, a consultancy, is proving they can generate strong returns from their green businesses-and outdo incumbents. Europe's utilities are already renewables giants. Investors have doubts. When bp vowed in September to ramp up investment in clean energy tenfold and reduce production of oil and gas by at least 40% by 2030, the market saw not a bold leap but a belly-flop. bp's market capitalisation kept sliding, to a 26-year low in October, until successful vaccine trials pepped up the oil price-and with it energy stocks.
Even in Europe incentives remain muddled. According to CarbonTracker, a watchdog, as of 2019 Shell and bp continued to reward executives for increasing oil and gas output. Shell and Total have set emissions targets that let them increase total production of oil provided their output from renewables and cleaner (though still polluting) natural gas rises faster. Shell sees gas as crucial to efforts to reduce its products' carbon intensity, and a complement to intermittent power from the wind and sun. In the third quarter its integrated gas business accounted for 22% of cashflow from operations. Total also views the fuel as strategic, with plans to nearly double its sales of liquefied natural gas by 2030. Goldman Sachs calculates that in 2019 low-carbon power accounted for just 3% of bp's capital spending, 4% of Shell's and 8% of Total's.
These figures are rising-even in America, though at a slower clip. Mr Della Vigna predicts that renewable power might account for 43% of capital spending by 2030 for bp and generate 17% of revenues. By 2025 Total plans to increase its installed solar and wind capacity from 5 to 35 gigawatts. On December 15th Norway's government approved funding for a big project to capture and store carbon that Shell will develop with Total and Equinor, Norway's state oil company. The prize for gaining scale in green energy is bigger than merely maintaining it in the dirty sort, says one seasoned investor. ""But"", he adds, ""the risk is also bigger."""

Hollywood is pivoting to home entertainment
IF ANY INDUSTRY could use help from Wonder Woman, it is cinemas. Lockdowns and a dearth of new releases have reduced worldwide box-office takings by about 70% in 2020. Thankfully for theatre owners, the corseted crusader will charge to the rescue on Christmas Day, giving audiences a reason to go back to the movies.
Yet in a plot twist, at&t, the telecoms giant that owns the film's producer, Warner Bros, has announced that ""Wonder Woman 1984"" and the 17 feature films on Warner's release slate for 2021will be made available on its hbo Max streaming service on the day they are released in cinemas, which historically have had an exclusive run of a few months. Purists are aghast. ""The future of cinema will be on the big screen, no matter what any Wall Street dilettante says,"" declared Denis Villeneuve, whose sci-fi epic, ""Dune"", is among the affected films.
Warner is not the only studio shifting its focus to the small screen. In July Universal Pictures, part of Comcast, a cable company, did a deal with amc, the world's largest cinema chain, to give theatres just 17 days before its films are made available online (amc will get a cut of streaming revenues). Paramount Pictures, owned by ViacomcBS, has sold several films to Netflix this year rather than release them to empty auditoriums. And on December 10th Disney, Hollywood's biggest studio, signalled that it, too, sees its future in streaming.
In a presentation to investors the studio announced a blitz of new content for its Disney+ streaming service: ten ""Star Wars"" series, ten more based on Marvel comic books, 15 other new original series and 15 feature films. By 2024 Disney+ will be spending $8bn-9bn annually on content, up from $2bn in 2020. Add espn+, which shows sports, and Hulu, another Disney streaming channel, and the company will splurge $14bn-16bn a year, nearly as much as the $17bn that Netflix, which pioneered streaming, earmarked to spend in 2020.
Disney's ""content tsunami"" is ""frightening to any sub-scale company thinking about competing in the scripted entertainment space"", wrote Michael Nathanson of MoffattNathanson, a media-research firm. The Wall Street dilettantes swooned: Disney's share price leapt by almost 14% the day after its presentation, reaching an alltime high and adding $38bn to its stockmarket value (see chart on previous page).
Disney now expects 230m-260m Disney+ subscribers by 2024-more than treble its previous target. The extra viewers, and a planned price rise, put the service on track to break even in 2024, despite more content spending. Across all its streaming channels Disney expects more than 300m subscribers by 2024-maybe enough to overtake Netflix, currently on 195m. Disney will take Netflix on more directly via a new service, Star, with a wider range of programming, including a new show starring the indefatigable Kardashian clan.
Two months ago Disney began a corporate restructuring to increase its focus on streaming. Since then it has trimmed jobs at abc News and announced the winding up of its radio business. The plans for Disney+ imply that by 2024 streaming will be the company's single largest business by revenues, notes Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, a bank. Whatever some directors may think, ""made for tv"" is no longer a slur in Hollywood."

Following the tragic yachting accident that killed my predecessor, Buck Passer, the board decided on a change of direction at Multinational United Subsidiary Holdings (mush). As the new chief executive, I would like to live up to my nickname, ""Honest Harry"" Hunter and tell it to you straight.
We had a dreadful 2020. To be fair, nobody could have reasonably expected the executive team to predict a global pandemic which resulted in widespread economic shutdowns. But by the same token, if managers aren't at least partly responsible during the bad times, they shouldn't take full credit for the good times. Most executives are riding on the backs of central bankers who have slashed the cost of capital and on technology pioneers who have made it easier to transact and communicate.
So, given that my fellow executives took bonuses in the boom years, we are slashing their salaries by half. That will give us more money to save jobs in the rest of the group. This may upset people in the c-suite and prompt some of them to leave. We will miss them-and wish them well finding a new job in the current labour market. We also know that many of you had to keep coming into our factories and warehouses during the pandemic while most of the office staff have been able to work from home. So as budgets are tight, we are making sure that the salaries of those essential workers keep pace with inflation this year. For everyone else, there will be a pay freeze.
Another cost-saving measure will be the elimination of my predecessor's use of management consultants. I have nothing against the profession, which is full of bright people. But if my executive team needs advice on how to do their jobs, that raises the question of why they were hired in the first place.
What about 2021? There is no point in making economic predictions; the best approach is to clear up the mistakes made in the past. First of all, my predecessor bought too many companies without considering whether they would fit well with the rest of the group. Chief executives like acquisitions: to expand their empires and give them news to announce when they are talking to investors. Time the purchase right and you can boost both earnings and the share price.
But all too often these are vanity purchases, like the middle-aged man who buys a Porsche to reclaim his lost youth. When combining companies, it is possible to make savings in areas like procurement but these are often more than offset by the loss of morale that occurs when managers try to mesh organisations with completely different cultures. So we are not going to make any acquisitions in 2021. Instead, we are going to see if some of our subsidiaries can be spun off as stand-alone organisations. They can probably manage their businesses far better than we can.
Speaking of management changes, too much staff time is taken up by meetings. From now on, team leaders will have a 15-minute catch-up every morning; if there is important news, they can message employees directly. Most of the staff should not be expected to attend an internal meeting more than once a month. That should give them more time to meet the important people, our suppliers and customers, or just to get on with their jobs.
Other changes are required to end the gobbledygook that plagued the previous regime. We will no longer have a ""human resources"" department: our employees are people, not resources. That section has been renamed personnel. Similarly, the whole concept of a ""thought leadership"" division is both pretentious and Orwellian; clients are not impressed by this waffle and in order to save money I will shut our unit down.
Finally, there is a lot of talk about corporate purpose, and a lot of grandiose language tends to be used by other executives. So let me tell you the purpose of this business under my leadership. It is to create a company that provides products and services that customers are eager to buy. In turn, that depends on ensuring that our employees are both well-rewarded and committed to their tasks. If we can achieve those goals, then the returns to shareholders will look after themselves.
So enjoy your holiday break-you have earned it. I can't promise you that things will be better in 2021. But if they aren't, it won't be for lack of effort from me or the rest of the management team. Thanks for all you have done this year.
Best wishes,
Harry Hunter"

Something has changed since your columnist first met Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, over a no-frills sandwich lunch almost two decades ago. He still talks blarney at supersonic speed. He still rails against an unholy trinity of flag-carriers, governments and regulators. But his tone is different: less cursing (only three ""fucks"" in an hour) and even a moment of half-joking humility (""I would like to think I have emerged like Scrooge on Christmas morning realising the error of my ways""). Most notably, his views have mellowed about three constituencies which for decades he would reliably berate, if chiefly for publicity purposes: customers (""usually wrong""), unions (""busted flushes"") and environmentalists (""shoot them"").
The reason for this newfound magnanimity, as he explains it, is Ryanair's size. Bad-mouthing everyone was fine when he led a scrappy upstart fighting flag-carriers lavished with state aid. But now Ryanair is Europe's biggest airline, worth almost as much as the owners of British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France and EasyJet combined. In 2019 it carried 152m people, comfortably ahead of Southwest Airlines, the American low-cost carrier on which it is modelled. ""We have to be more sensible,"" Mr O'Leary says.
""Sensible"" is a broad term. Ryanair has just put in a huge order for Boeing's 737 max jets, which are only beginning to come back into service after being grounded in the wake of two tragic crashes in 2018 and 2019. It may be one of the rashest moves of Mr O'Leary's career. Or it could signal that, like any insurgent-turned-incumbent, Ryanair now has a huge stake in maintaining the system it helped create. In effect, by increasing its max order from 135 to 210 (admittedly at a hefty discount from Boeing), the airline is betting that within a few years aviation will return to just the way it was before the covid-19 pandemic bludgeoned travel. It is a wager on the preservation of the status quo.
It is not the first time Mr O'Leary has thrown the dice at a time of historic convulsion. The sandwich lunch in 2002 followed Ryanair's order of 100 Boeing 737-800 jets just four months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in America. It was a lifeline for Boeing-and made Mr O'Leary a hero in Seattle, the aeroplane-maker's hometown. It was a roaring success for Ryanair, thrusting it into the big leagues in Europe. In two ways, he is hoping history will repeat itself.
The first is that, if you offer people low-enough fares, not even safety concerns will keep them from travelling. The threat of terrorism did not put off passengers for long. Mr O'Leary is sure the same will happen again following the recertification of the 737 max by America's Federal Aviation Administration in November, and draft approval by European regulators the same month. Ryanair calls the max ""the most audited, most regulated [aircraft] in history"". Its more numerous seats and lower fuel costs allow Ryanair to make tickets ultra-cheap. Anyone who does not want to board it will be put on a later flight on another aircraft, Mr O'Leary promises. But, he says, ""€9.99 [$12] fares will cure an awful lot of customer apprehension.""
Mr O'Leary's second assumption is that the need to restore Europe's battered tourism industry, combined with pent-up demand for travel, will mean fewer curbs on airlines, as they did after 9/11. This Christmas and new year Ryanair plans to bombard Europeans with adverts enticing them to fly abroad next summer, capitalising on hopes for the covid-19 vaccine. It assumes that other large carriers, such as British Airways and Lufthansa, will continue to suffer from subdued long-haul and business-class travel, a big source of revenue, reducing their ability to subsidise cheaper flights within Europe for a few years. With hotels, bars and beaches empty, Mr O'Leary thinks that European regulators will be reluctant to push more ""anti-aircraft"" environmental taxes. As Ryanair takes delivery of more 737 MAxes, by the summer of 2026 it expects to have almost 150 more aircraft flying than it did in 2019. In the meantime, its boss predicts, some European carriers will go bust or be acquired, further consolidating the industry-with Ryanair at the front of the pack.
Not everything will be the same as before. Mr O'Leary admits he was ""much too cavalier"" in his treatment of customers. These days he is more respectful. He is proud of deals he has struck with pilot and cabin-crew unions, with which he once picked fights. In the pandemic they have mostly taken pay cuts in exchange for keeping their jobs. And he notes that the max emits less carbon and less noise than its forerunners, which he hopes will ease concerns among green-minded passengers and people living near runways.
Be leery
The danger for Ryanair is that a supreme leader who thinks he has seen it all before fails to see that some things may have fundamentally changed-especially on climate change. Asked about the move by Airbus, Boeing's European arch-rival, to develop zero-carbon hydrogen planes by 2035, Mr O'Leary is unimpressed. He loses interest over such engineering matters, he admits. He adds that Europe does not have the luxury of constraining air travel anyway; its lack of industrial competitiveness means services, especially tourism, are more important than ever and need low-cost flights.
He may be right. In the battle between Europe's ""flight-shaming"" ecowarriors and those wanting cheap holidays abroad, the second lot may prevail. Over the next decade or so Europe's priority may be to curb car emissions more than those from aviation. But Mr O'Leary may also be complacent. He risks locking Ryanair into a dirty technology-and a partnership with Boeing-that may be out of step with the times. He may underestimate the Eu's desire to crack down on carbon. And he may overlook the greener alternatives that could support tourism in Europe: trains, buses and increasingly electrified cars. Once Ryanair was a David, wielding its slingshot with deadly accuracy against industry Goliaths. The danger is that it may now be the one with the blind spot. *"

Wall Street's latest shiny new thing: quantum computing
The finance industry has had a long and profitable relationship with computing. It was an early adopter of everything from mainframe computers to artificial intelligence (see timeline on next page). For most of the past decade more trades have been done at high frequency by complex algorithms than by humans. Now big banks have their eyes on quantum computing, another cutting-edge technology.
This is the idea, developed by physicists in the 1980s, that the counter-intuitive properties of quantum mechanics might allow for the construction of computers that could perform mathematical feats that no non-quantum machine would ever be capable of. The promise is now starting to be realised. Computing giants like Google and ibm, as well as a flock of smaller competitors, are building and refining quantum hardware.
Quantum computers will not beat their classical counterparts at everything. But much of the maths at which they will excel is of interest to bankers. At a conference on December 10th William Zeng, head of quantum research at Goldman Sachs told the audience that quantum computing could have a ""revolutionary"" impact on the bank, and on finance more broadly.
Many financial calculations boil down to optimisation problems, a known strength of quantum computers, says Marco Pistoia, the head of a research unit at JPMorgan Chase, who spent many years at ibm before that. Quantum quants hope their machines will boost profits by speeding up asset pricing, digging up better-performing portfolios and making machinelearning algorithms more accurate. A study by bbva, a Spanish bank, concluded in July that quantum computers could boost credit-scoring, spot arbitrage opportunities and accelerate so-called ""Monte Carlo"" simulations, which are commonly used in finance to try to model the likely behaviour of markets.
Finance is not the only industry looking for a way to profit from even the small, unstable quantum computers that mark the current state of the art; sectors from aerospace to pharmaceuticals are also hunting for a ""quantum advantage"". But there are reasons to think finance may be among the first to find it. Mike Biercuk of q-ctrl, a startup that makes control software for quantum computers, points out that a new financial algorithm can be deployed faster than a new industrial process. The size of financial markets means that even a small advance would be worth a lot of money.
Banks are also buying in expertise. Firms including bbva, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Standard Chartered have set up research teams and signed deals with computing firms. The Boston Consulting Group reckons that, as of June, banks and insurers in America and Europe had hired more than 115 experts-a big number for what remains, even in academia, a small specialism. ""We have more physics and maths PhDs than some big universities,"" jokes Alexei Kondratyev, head of data analytics at Standard Chartered.
Startups are exploring possibilities too. Enrique Lizaso of Multiverse Computing reckons his firm's quantum-enhanced algorithms can spot fraud more effectively, and around a hundred times faster, than existing ones. The firm has also experimented with portfolio optimisation, in which analysts seek well-performing investment strategies. Multiverse re-ran decisions made by real traders at a bank. The job was to choose, over the course of a year, the most profitable mix from a group of 50 assets, subject to restrictions, such as how often trades could be made.
The result was a problem with around 10i,3oo possible solutions, a number that far outstrips the number of atoms in the visible universe. In reality, the bank's traders, assisted by models running on classical computers, managed an annual return of 19%. Depending on the amount of volatility investors were prepared to put up with, Multiverse's algorithm generated returns of 20-80%-though it stops short of claiming a definitive quantum advantage.
Not all potential uses are so glamorous. Monte Carlo simulations are often used in regulatory stress tests. Christopher Savoie of Zapata, a quantum-computing firm based in Boston, recalls one bank executive telling him: ""Don't bring me trading algorithms, bring me a solution to ccar [an American stress-test regulation]. That stuff eats up half my computing budget.""
All this is promising. But quantum financiers acknowledge that, for now, hardware is a limitation. ""We're not yet able to perform these calculations at a scale where a quantum machine offers a real-world advantage over a classical one,"" says Mr Biercuk. One rough way to measure a quantum computer's capability is its number of ""qubits"", the analogue of classical computing's 1-or-o bits. For many problems a quantum computer with thousands of stable qubits is provably far faster than any non-quantum machine that could ever be built-it just does not exist yet.
For now, the field must make do with small, unstable devices, which can perform calculations for only tiny fractions of a second before their delicate quantum states break down. John Preskill of the fornia of Technology has dubbed these ""nisqs""-""Noisy, Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers"".
Bankers are working on ways to conduct computations on such machines. Mr Zeng of Goldman pointed out that the computational resources needed to run quantum algorithms have fallen as programmers have tweaked their methods. Mr Pistoia points to papers his team has written exploring ways to scale useful financial calculations into even small machines.
And at some point those programmers will meet hardware-makers coming the other way. In 2019 Google was the first to demonstrate ""quantum supremacy"", using a 53-qubit nisq machine to perform in minutes a calculation that would have taken the world's fastest supercomputer more than 10,000 years. ibm, which has invested heavily in quantum computing, reckons it can build a 1,000-qubit machine by 2023. Both it and Google have talked of a million qubits by the end of the decade.
When might the financial revolution come? Mr Savoie thinks simple algorithms could be in use within 18 months, with credit-scoring a plausible early application. Mr Kondratyev says three to five years is more realistic. But the crucial point, says one observer, is that no one wants to be late to the party. One common worry is that whoever makes a breakthrough first may choose to reap the rewards in obscurity, rather than broadcast the fact to the world. After all, says Mr Biercuk, ""that is how high-frequency trading got started""."

There may be more sense to recent market movements than you think
Even in normal times, there is an element of drama to the markets. The oil price may spike or slump in reaction to a geopolitical wobble; bond yields may leap on strong jobs figures; and shareholders may pump up a stock that posted juicy profits. But 2020 has taken the drama to an extreme (see chart 1). The equity sell-off in March was unmatched in its swiftness: stocks lost 30% of their value in a month. The yield on ten-year American Treasuries, the most important asset worldwide, fell by half between January and the middle of March and then by half again in a matter of days, before seizing up and yo-yoing. The contract for imminently delivered barrels of American oil briefly went negative. Over the course of 2020 timber prices have fallen by half, doubled, doubled again, fallen by half once more and then doubled again (overall, they have doubled in 2020).
If the plunge in asset prices as countries locked down terrified asset managers, then recovery-led by a fierce bull run in tech stocks over the summer-has made them uneasy. It was only in 2018 that a public company, Apple, first became valued at more than $1trn. In net terms, Apple has gained around $750bn this year. Tesla has increased in value six-fold this year, to a market capitalisation of more than $600bn, roughly the value of the other seven most valuable carmakers combined. Even stocks that were unloved earlier in the year, like banks and energy firms, have rebounded of late, on a spate of good news-of an effective vaccine, and of a clear victory for Joe Biden in America's presidential elections. When Airbnb, a platform for booking overnight stays, made its public debut on December 10th- after a year in which no-one travelled anywhere-its share price leapt by 115%. On December 5th the value of global stocks crossed $100trn for the first time.
Financial markets reflect investors' expectations about the future, so it is hardly surprising that they have been chaotic in 2020. But the rebound in risky assets amid fragile economic conditions prompts the question of whether bubbles have formed in certain assets, or whether the ups and downs can be explained by rapidly shifting fundamental factors.
Consider first the evidence for froth. Even as profits slumped, investors in the s&p 500 benchmark index earned 14.3% (excluding dividends) in 2020, about double the typical return over the past 20 years. The gains have pumped up measures of stockmarket valuations. One such gauge is the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings, or ""cape"", ratio, devised by Robert Shiller, a Nobel-prizewinning economist. This looks at inflation-adjusted share prices relative to the ten-year average of real earnings per share. When the ratio is high, stocks are dear relative to their earnings; ? such periods have tended to be followed by low long-term returns over the next decade. In America the ratio in November 2020 was 33, above its level earlier in the year (see chart 2). Only twice before has the ratio exceeded 30 in America-the late 1920s and the early 2000s.
The big tech firms, many of which were expected to benefit from online shopping and home working, have played a disproportionate role in the broader rally. They account for two-thirds of the total returns from holding the s&p 500. At the start of 2020 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft were worth around $5trn and made up 17.5% of the value of the index. The five are now worth more than $7trn, and their share has risen to 22%.
Further evidence of froth is the frenzy around initial public offerings of firms such as Airbnb, and the revival in retail trading. Retail investors accounted for 20% of the volume of stock trading, up from 15% in 2019. In the summer small buyers of call options-bets on share prices rising-were responsible for more derivatives trading than large ones.
The circumstantial evidence, then, looks bubbly. But a cross-examination of fundamental factors suggests that these can explain more than a fair chunk of what is going on. Cyclical assets, like stocks in restaurants and retailers, or commodities, like oil and copper, tend to rally as business booms. These fell quickly in value in February and March, followed by slow recoveries as the world reopened. But since November 9th, when news of an effective vaccine broke, they have surged. Container-freight rates have risen to all-time highs. Brent crude oil rose above $50 a barrel for the first time since March on December 10th.
Moreover, the move in interest rates appears to more than explain the behaviour of equity prices. In isolation, the cape ratio ignores the impact of discount rates on valuations. The value of a firm, to its shareholders, is the present value of a firm's future profits-meaning share prices tend to be sensitive to changing expectations of future profits, but also to the discount rate used to calculate what those are worth today. There have been enormous changes in this discount rate for stocks. At the start of 2020 the yield on ten-year Treasuries was 1.8%; by the middle of March it was just 0.6%. Since the vaccine news yields have risen once more, to around 0.9%.
To account for this, on November 30th Mr Shiller published ""excess cape yield"" numbers, which are calculated by inverting the cape ratio, to give an indication of the expected yield on equities, and then subtracting the expected real returns on holding bonds (which, thanks to low rates and modest inflation expectations over the next decade, are negative). The excess yield is actually higher than in January (see chart 3). In other words, equities have become more attractive than bonds-at first probably because bond yields fell so quickly, boosting the relative appeal of stocks, but lately thanks to the vaccine heralding the return of growth and profits, which a modest increase in yields has not offset.
The rise in share prices alone, then, is probably not enough to indicate a mania, given the shift in discount rates. This may not dispel investors' disquiet, in part because they are surrounded by evidence of exuberance. But the case for a bubble, at the very least, is not open and shut. *"

The gold standard, revisited
In the aftermath of the first world war, the gold standard inspired nearly religious fervour from central bankers. European officials dutifully repegged their war-battered currencies to gold at great cost to their citizens. A hundred years on, it has lost its lustre. Judy Shelton's past support for it may have derailed her nomination to the Federal Reserve's board. A recent paper· shows why the gold standard's tarnished reputation is well deserved.
The authors calculate the impact of a gold standard, had it been in place in 2000-20. This would have required the Fed to set interest rates to maintain a fixed dollar price of gold, rather than to target inflation. The central bank's policy rate would have become a function of gold supply-the amount of metal mined-and gold demand from investors and households.
Fluctuating gold demand can make monetary policy procyclical. In bad times, people stop spending and increase their demand for gold, so central banks must raise interest rates to make other assets more attractive and stabilise gold's price. In good times the reverse happens, and central banks have to cut rates. The pace at which gold is mined also introduces some randomness to monetary policy. Whenever gold floods the market, interest rates must fall to keep its price stable. Gold shortages force interest rates up. It is up to fate whether or not the movements in rates are good for the economy.
It requires Herculean assumptions for the gold standard to beat today's regime, judged by gauges such as the volatility of inflation. The authors show this would be so if the only forces buffeting the economy were fluctuations in productivity growth and in labour supply, and if the supply of gold tracked productivity.
Those assumptions, though, do not survive contact with reality. To adhere to the gold standard the Fed would have had to maintain high interest rates even during the global financial crisis, and beyond, with disastrous effects; in the first quarter of 2020, output would have been 10% lower than otherwise. Gold's lost shine is no bad thing."

Supply-chain managers have had a stressful few years. From Sino-American trade wars and Brexit to covid-induced restrictions on medical exports and travel, there has been a lot to deal with. At the worst of the pandemic company bosses inevitably wondered if bringing production closer to consumers might help. In April a survey conducted by ey, an accounting firm, found that as many as 83% of multinational executives were contemplating so-called ""reshoring"" or ""nearshoring"". Recent history shows how sticky supply chains can be, but might this time be different?
Politicians have long angled for companies to shift production to their shores because they want jobs for their constituents. There can be a business case for it too, in order to cut transport costs, say, or reduce inventories. The Reshoring Initiative, which advocates for more manufacturing in America, cites the allure of ""Made in usa"" branding for older Midwesterners. Some reckon technology might encourage reshoring. In 2017 a report by ing, a bank, predicted that 3D printing could wipe out 40% of trade flows by 2040.
Yet the experience of the past decade suggests that for every company reshoring production, there may be more doing the opposite. A survey of German manufacturers found that 2% brought production home between 2010 and mid-2012. Four times as many shifted operations abroad during that time. A study published in 2016 by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, found that the effects of reshoring on national economies were ""(still) limited"".
Nor does recent history suggest that new technologies will cannibalise trade. Take 3D printing. A study by Caroline Freund, Alen Mulabdic and Michele Ruta of the World Bank found that its use in the hearing-aid industry increased trade by 58% over nearly a decade, compared with what it might have been expected to be otherwise. As the technology was useful for only part of the manufacturing process and hearing aids are cheap to transport, supply chains did not retreat. Gary Gereffi of Duke University cites the failure of Adidas to print shoes in America and Germany as evidence of the importance of highly orchestrated production networks. He found that a lack of locally available components meant the shoes had to be simplified so much they lost their consumer appeal. The adoption of other technologies can make importing, rather than reshoring, more attractive. Katherine Stapleton of the World Bank and Michael Webb of Stanford University found that Spanish firms using robots were more likely to increase their imports from low-income countries, or open affiliates there. Productivity-enhancing automation led firms to expand output, and so import more parts.
The rise in tariffs in America and elsewhere over the past four years could, in theory, have been a game-changer, encouraging companies to move supply chains nearer consumers. But evidence of a great shift towards ""Made in usa"" following President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports is scant. Although American manufacturing imports from 14 Asian countries fell in 2019, there was no offsetting increase in gross domestic manufacturing production. A study by Ben Charoenwong of the National University of Singapore and Miaozhe Han and Jing Wu of the Chinese University of Hong Kong suggests that, while trade-policy uncertainty was associated with a reduction in the number of foreign suppliers to American companies serving the home market, on average these acquired no more domestic suppliers.
Might the pandemic prompt a shifting of supply chains? So far signs of reshoring are limited. In America import growth is outpacing domestic manufacturing production. Medical companies may be scarred by their experience of the swine-flu outbreak in 2009. At a hearing held by the United States International Trade Commission in September this year, one speaker recalled that companies ramped up production after the swine-flu pandemic, only to be driven to the verge of bankruptcy when demand fell back to normal. Sebastien Miroudot of the oecd finds that the evidence in favour of diversifying across many suppliers is shaky; experience suggests that firms with fewer, longer relationships recover from shocks more quickly. Rather than relocation, he has written, the research seems to argue for ensuring that production can be flexibly moved from place to place in an emergency.
The call of home
After their initial scare at the start of the pandemic, many companies now seem to have lost their urge to rush back home. A follow-up survey by ey in October found that just 37% of executives were still considering reshoring; a recent survey of firms in America and Europe by Euler Hermes, a trade-credit insurer, found that less than 15% were contemplating reshoring because of covid-19.
Some caution is in order, though. The pandemic is not over, and shifting production can be a slow business. There is some sign of movement in specialist industries: Biju Mohan of gep, a supplychain consultancy, reports increased interest from life-sciences firms in moving production from China to America. And industrial policy is back in vogue, and only just gathering steam in Europe and America. Both have plans to subsidise chipmaking, for example, and to make home-grown renewable-energy investments. The economic plan of America's president-elect, Joe Biden, talks of firms being ""dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers"".
The resilience of supply chains so far may come down to a virtuous circle created when globalisation accelerated in the 1990s. When production networks stretch across several countries, trade restrictions can backfire, hurting both the exporter and the importer. That gave governments a big incentive to co-operate, and in turn meant companies were comfortable building or relying on far-flung factories. But, as Brexit, the trade war and a hobbled World Trade Organisation show, that trust is eroding, and companies' sense of security with it. Companies do not want to hunker down behind borders. But they could yet be forced to do so. *"

Following the tracks of NASA's Curiosity rover
THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS OF MARS
How you came to be on this flat desert plain at this time does not matter. What matters is the landscape around you.
To the north there is what appears to be a rim around the world, brightened by morning-lit dust at its base, darker as it rises into the sky. In some places it is a disordered, stepping-stone staircase of hummocky hills; in some it has a steep, solid face. However they are reached, though, its heights are strangely continuous and peculiarly even in stature: a scarp, not a mountain range, one that curves as it stretches to the left and right, the east and west.
You turn and face the mountain, broad and daunting. It is both nearer than the rim which encircles it and higher-taller and more wide-shouldered than Mont Blanc, Mount Rainier or Mount Fuji. Around its base, dunes sweep past flat-topped mesas. Behind and above them, a layered reddish rock rises a kilometre or more, its sturdy ridges casting stripes of shadow in the oblique light. The slopes immediately above are brighter and more chaotic, like a soft wood savagely chiselled. Higher still, towards the snowless peak, you think you pick out layers again, perhaps, of some sort. But it is hard to say: the air, though thin, is dusty, and the heights are far away.
You adjust your straps, square your shoulders, and start to walk towards it.
The encircling scarp to the north of you is the rim of Gale crater, a circular basin 150km in diameter which, though only five degrees from the Martian equator, is part of what scientists call the southern highlands. It was formed by the impact of an asteroid between 3.8bn and 3.5bn years ago. The crater-bottom plain over which you are walking is Aeolis Palus; the mountain towards which you are headed is known officially as Aeolis Mons, but colloquially as Mount Sharp.
The heights of Mount Sharp are unlike those of any Earthly mountain. Its roots are older than any Earthly continent. The rocks under your feet, though, have no such strangeness to them. Only an expert geochemist could distinguish them from the rocks of some Earthly desert. The mountain-in-a-crater landscape has been shaped by forces never expressed this way on Earth. But the details and textures that meet your eyes are entirely familiar. Indeed, the rocks are doubly familiar: familiar from analogues on the Earth; familiar from prior inspection. Everything you see here in Gale crater has already been examined and appreciated through eyes from Earth. Just not through human ones.
It is not its height which makes Mount Sharp special. Olympus Mons rises almost 25km above the lowlands of Amazonis, three times the height of Everest. The great peaks of Tharsis and Elysium rise considerably higher than Hawaii's Mauna Loa does above the abyssal plains of the Pacific. Mount Sharp is modest by comparison. But unlike Mars's highest heights, it was 1 created in a uniquely Martian way.
Earth's mountains come in two forms. There are chains like the Alps and Himalayas, pushed up when two tectonic plates collide, and there are volcanoes, built up by hot rock rising from below. But both types, like empires, go through a rise and fall. The forces that drive them into the sky eventually abate; erosion takes care of what is left behind.
Mars's greatest mountains, and many of its smaller ones, are volcanoes of a particular type-built up by flow after flow of dark, basaltic lava driven to the surface by heat from the mantle far below. They can be higher than Earth's because, perhaps ironically, Mars is a smaller planet. Being small, it started off with less internal heat than Earth; it has lower gravity; and it has been unable to hang on to the thick atmosphere it once seems to have had: that is all good news from the point of view of mega-mountains.
A lack of internal heat means that the planet's stiff, cold crust is thicker than Earth's, and not divided into jostling tectonic plates. On Earth a hotspot in the mantle can feed magma to a mountain on the surface above for only a few million years before the movements of the crust sever the link. On Mars the crust stays put, so a mantle hotspot can feed the growth of a single volcano for a billion years, maybe more.
On Earth, the crust would buckle under such loads. On Mars, where the crust is thicker and basalt weighs less, it supports them. And the thin, dry atmosphere means their heights see hardly any erosion. Ice and running water quickly erode away Earth's proudest peaks. Troubled only by the thinnest of winds, Mars's great volcanoes suffer no such levelling. They stood as high as they do today when the rocks of Everest first started their rise from the bottom of the Indian Ocean: they will be all but unchanged when erosion has returned the Himalayas to the plains and seas below.
At lower altitudes, though, the weak but insistent wind can have its way with softer rocks, and that is the unearthly way in which Mount Sharp was made. When Gale crater was formed, Mars had not yet become the cold, dry, all-but-airless world it is today. Looking at pictures taken from orbit in the 20th century, scientists saw that soon after Gale's formation its rim, then considerably higher than the remnant away from which you are walking, was ground down in the way that mountains on Earth are, with rivers and streams spreading its remains over the crater's floor.
When the water and ice ran out, wind-blown sediments were piled on top of these water-borne ones. Not long after the planet's comparatively warm, wet youth was fully spent, Gale's great basin was filled, perhaps to the brim, with sediments hardened into rock-as, it appears, were craters across the Southern Highlands. Mars boasts the only such sedimentary rocks yet seen anywhere beyond Earth.
Having given, the wind then began to take away. For geologists interested in wind-shaped landscapes Mars is very heaven. For billions of years its thin winds have been building dunes, carving yardangs, polishing desert pavements and endlessly redistributing dust. All these processes take place on Earth. But on Earth the rain raineth, if not every day, at least every century, and deserts bloom or vanish as climates and continents shift. None of that happens on Mars. The wind has world enough and time to do all that it could wish.
At Gale, and in other filled-in craters, it excavated. But it did so unevenly, scouring harder near the rim, paying less attention to the middle. Consequently the central sediments began to stand proud. The presence of this protuberance encouraged the wind to pass around it, reinforcing its tendency to dig more deeply closer to the rim, hollowing out a doughnut trench. And so, over aeons, Mount Sharp was cut out of the once-even plain, a mountain not added to the surface from below like those of Earth, but created by subtraction from above.
In carving out Mount Sharp, the winds laid bare the planet's history. Its higher slopes are all but certainly made of compacted dust, and maybe some volcanic ash. Its lower strata are part of the original sedimentary infilling, washed into place from the eroding rim. So are the lowlands. You are walking on a lake bed that dates to a time when the Sun was but a quarter of its current age. The thought makes you both proud and slightly uneasy as you scuttle across the silent floor.
At the dawn of the 21st century, when the sedimentary deep past of Mars was first beginning to be appreciated, geologists realised that the aeolian landscape of Gale crater offered a pair of attributes that made it a particularly promising site for study. The sedimentary strata of lower Mount Sharp might record both the planet's early environment and the chemical changes that accompanied its subsequent desiccation. And the adjacent crater floor offered a nice big patch of smooth terrain on which a spacecraft could land.
So on August 6th 2012 a hovering ""sky crane"" that had parachuted down through the Martian sky lowered a rover called Curiosity onto the surface. The sediments that had been hoped for were there in abundance. ""I'd expected mudstones,"" said one geologist. ""I hadn't expected to spend most of the mission looking at them."" Within a couple of years Curiosity had confirmed that the inside of Gale crater really had been a lake, one with a rich history of its own. It had emptied and filled up again. There were coarser rocks closer to where the sediments had washed down from the rim; there were what seemed to be stream beds filled in by later muds, their rocks preserving ripples created by the gentle flow of water aeons ago. It was the best evidence ever seen of a habitable environment beyond Earth.
Curiosity crept forward a few metres at a time. It took years to reach the mountain. You are covering the distance a thousand times faster. But your walk is still rather slow. This is not due to dawdling or awe, though maybe it should be. It is a matter of physics. The lower gravity of Mars slows things down. When you walk at a natural pace, the leg that is off the ground swings forward like a pendulum: that is what makes walking so energy-efficient. Pendulums swing slower under the low gravity of Mars, and thus so do legs; your walking pace is about two-thirds what it is on Earth.
But other gaits are available. One involves pushing your lighter-than-it-should-be body into the air with your forward foot so that both legs are out of contact with the ground as the trailing foot swings forwards. When you land on the same foot with which you pushed off, the other foot comes down ahead of it, giving you a split second of doubly-footed steadiness before you push off again with that second, now forward, foot. This is a gait that comes naturally to five-yearolds but which adults on Earth forsake; it takes up more energy than walking. On Mars it is both speedy and practical. And also rather fun. To reach the mountain faster, you start to skip.
As the land begins to rise, it also begins to break up. When the wind's scouring reaches a particularly tough layer of sediment, it deepens cracks within that layer and eventually gets to work on softer rocks beneath, undermining the overlying stratum. The land takes on a shattered look. Some bits collapse sooner than others, the hold-outs balancing, for a while, on plinths of softer rock below. The most dramatic such forms on Earth look like petrified pseudo-mushrooms: broad, tough caps on thin stems.
Curiosity never saw such pedestal formations. But you are not following directly in its tracks-they are protected as part of Martian heritage. And you can clamber over obstacles the rover would have had to circumnavigate. The ease with which you can jump up is the strongest reminder that this landscape is not an Earthly desert. That, and the lack of detritus. ""The only way you know that you're not in the American West"", said one of the Curiosity scientists, ""is that there are no old cars that have been used for target practice.""
When you come to the dunes, though, they add some otherworldly strangeness. Mars's nearly omnipresent, iron-oxide-rich, wind-blown dust imposes a palette of tan and reddish browns on almost all the planet's landscapes, not to mention its skies. The thin line of dunes around the mountain's base is an intervention of near perfect black, its slopes and crests like calligraphy in India ink.
This is because the dunes, unlike almost every other aspect of the Martian surface, are active. They are composed of sand from outside the crater blown against the mountain's base, accumulating in drifts which are flowing around to the west. And those rolling sand grains gather no dust. They maintain the colour of the basalt that makes up most of the Martian crust: tarmac black.
Curiosity had to look carefully for a safe passage through this Stygian flow. Active sands are no friends to rovers; one of its predecessors, Spirit, lost contact with Earth after it got stuck in a sand trap in Gusev crater. With the benefit of legs as opposed to wheels, and with muscles much stronger than is necessary in this weak gravity, you have no such fears. You can clamber up the dunes' shallow stoss sides and slide down their steep slipfaces. You can lie down and make sand angels that sharp-eyed satellites can see from space.
The pervasive out-of-placeness engendered by Mars tends to inhibit such frolics. Being alive in this barren, alien landscape is a triumphant achievement, but it is also an incipient pollution: matter out of place should know its place. But in the dunes it is different. Here Mars moves, and Mars forgets. The sands' journey around the flanks of Mount Sharp will erase all trace of your passing.
And so to the harder, steeper rock of Mount Sharp's slopes. They are still sedimentary, but geochemically distinct from the rocks below. Curiosity spent the early years of the 2020s making sense of those distinctions as it headed towards the intriguing gully of Gediz Vallis. You are content simply to climb them, headed up towards the wind-formed, wind-shaped strangeness of the higher reaches, your steps passing over unwitnessed and unmeasured spans of time.
Come and go
Late in the morning, you come to a sandstone ledge and pause; almost a kilometre above the dunes, you look around again. The rim, now lit evenly from the south, looks more uniform than it did earlier. The textures of the plain are richer looked down on than they were when you stood amid them. You can no longer look up at the peak without looking directly at the Sun, and so you don't. But it still beckons.
Curiosity's diligent explorations did not exhaust human curiosity about this place, nor dent the wonder to be felt here; in fact they whetted both. Mysteries remained, and still remain, spread out through the silent rocks and over all the planet's strange history. So much remains unknown.
But the rock you stand on and the slopes ahead: they are real and present, as solid beneath your feet as they were clear in Curiosity's cameras. The weak wind at your back, you continue the climb.

Working from home had its advantages, even in the 18th and 19th centuries
Sally brown, who was born in Vermont in the early 1800s, had a typically varied schedule for a working woman of the time. As her diary shows, one day she is finishing stockings; another she is milking a cow; another she is refining wool. All of her jobs were done from home.
The shift from offices to kitchen tables among white-collar workers in 2020 seems unprecedented, and only possible with Slack and Zoom. But it is nothing new. Indeed, the history of home-working suggests some surprising parallels with today.
The emergence of capitalism in Britain and elsewhere from the 1600s to the mid-19th century did not take place primarily in factories, but in people's houses. Workers made everything from dresses to shoes to matchboxes in their kitchens or bedrooms. When Adam Smith wrote ""The Wealth of Nations"" in 1776, it was perfectly common to work from home. Smith famously described the operation of the division of labour in pin-making, but not in a dark, satanic mill. He was describing a ""small manufactory"" of perhaps ten people-which could well have been in or attached to somebody's house.
It is not easy to put exact numbers on how many people have worked from home during different historical periods. Even in Britain, where economic data reach farther back than in any other country, little reliable labour-force data exist until the mid-1800s. Other sources left clues, however. One relates to the meaning of the word ""house"". Today it connotes domesticity. But up until the 19th century it had a much broader definition, with the suffix ""-house"" encompassing economic production, too. In ""A Christmas Carol"", Scrooge works in a ""counting-house"". Architecture offers other hints. In Britain, many 18th-century houses still have unusually large upstairs windows; cloth-weavers, who worked there, needed as much light as they could get.
Around 1900 French administrators took the lead in asking people about their place of work, not only what they did. They found that one-third of France's manufacturing workforce worked from home. Danish surveys around the same time found that a tenth of the total workforce did so full-time at home. These research efforts took place at the high point of the factory-based system of production; in previous decades the share of home-working would have been far higher. According to one estimate for America, using official data, in the early 1800s more than 40% of the total workforce laboured from home. Only by 1914 did the majority of the labour force work in an office or factory.
The emergence of an at-home industrial workforce had two main causes. The growth of global trade and the rise in per-person income from the 1600s onwards raised demand for manufactured goods such as woollens and watches. But the emerging new technology was more suited to small-scale working than large- ? scale factories (the spinning jenny, the machine which kickstarted the industrial revolution, was not invented until the 1760s). Homes were the obvious place to be.
What emerged was called the ""putting-out system"". Workers would collect raw materials, and sometimes equipment, from a central depot. They would return home and make the goods for a few days, before giving back the finished articles and getting paid. Workers were independent contractors: they were paid by the piece, not by the hour, and they had little if any guarantee of work week to week.
Accounts of what it was actually like to work from home in the 18th and 19th centuries are few and far between. Many putting-out workers were women, who were less likely to write autobiographies (women's dominance in the putting-out system also explains why generations of historians have not paid it much attention). Some characteristics nonetheless emerge from the archives. Average working hours were longer (see chart). Unlike today, where most people have one job, people flitted from one task to another, depending on where money could be made, like Sally Brown.
With fingers weary and worn
Some economic historians suggest that workers were mercilessly exploited under the putting-out system. Those who owned the machines and raw materials enjoyed enormous power over those they employed. With workers dispersed across a county, it was difficult for them to team up against exploitative bosses to demand better pay, let alone form trade unions. Bosses ""could easily gang up against the rural spinner who faced a take-it-or-leave-it offer of work,"" argue Jane Humphries and Ben Schneider of Oxford University, in a paper from 2019. Some workers truly struggled. Thomas Hood's poem ""The Song of the Shirt"" evokes a home-working woman labouring in poverty.
As a result, some historians welcome the development of the factory system from the late 18th century onwards. Workers moved from a place where domestic life intermingled freely with economic production to a place solely dedicated to the pursuit of efficiency. It is hardly surprising that labour productivity was higher in the factory, nor that the factory system gradually outperformed the putting-out system and came to replace it. Crammed together in a factory, workers could more easily club together to ask for higher wages; trade unions started to grow from the 1850s onwards. According to English data, factory workers were paid 10-20% more than home-workers.
But is that the whole story? Some home-workers resisted the shift to the factory system-most notably by joining the Luddites, a society of English textile workers in the 19th century who smashed up machines which they perceived were putting them out of a job. Another explanation is that factory owners, at least in the short term, had little option but to offer higher wages in order to entice workers from their homes. That suggests that home-working had its advantages.
One such advantage was economic. Home-workers may have been poorly paid relative to factory folk, but they could earn income by other means. Wool-industry home-workers would receive a given quantity of material and were then supposed to return the same weight of material fashioned into stockings. But by exposing the wool to steam, it would weigh more, allowing the workers to keep some of the raw materials.
That was not the only advantage. Home-workers in rural or semi-rural areas could forage for fuel and food, and so boost their meagre incomes. One observer in 1813 noted sniffily that women in Surrey, a county close to London, were making three shillings a week from cutting down heath to make brooms-""miserable productions and trifling employments"", in his view. But three shillings a week was not far off average female earnings at the time.
Home-workers also had more control over their time. So long as the work was done to the required standard and on time, they were not told exactly when or how to do it. That was in sharp contrast to the factory, where every aspect of life was planned in advance and workers were closely monitored. And home-workers could decide on the exact mix between work and leisure-in contrast to factory workers, who either worked the 12- or 14-hour days stipulated by the factory owner or none at all. Average working hours in the 18th century were shorter than they became in the 19th. After drinking heavily on Sunday evening, homeworkers often took the day off before they went ""reluctantly back to work Tuesday, warmed to the task Wednesday, and laboured furiously Thursday and Friday"", as David Landes, an economic historian at Harvard University, put it. People also got more sleep.
This greater autonomy was especially important for mothers. In a world where men did little by way of family work, women could combine child care with contributing to the family income. It was far from easy. Sometimes women would give their infants ""Godfrey's Cordial"", a mixture of sugar syrup and laudanum, to knock them out for a while. But home-working allowed for the combination of paid work and family work in a way that the factory system did not. As factories spread, female labour-force participation fell.
In 1920 Max Weber, a German sociologist, argued that the separation of the worker's place of work from their home had ""extraordinarily far-reaching"" consequences. The factory was more efficient than the home-based system which had preceded it-but it was also a space in which workers had less control over their lives, and where they had much less fun. Depending on how permanent it proves to be, today's pandemic-induced shift back to the home could have similarly far-reaching effects.
Some homeworkers resisted the shift to the factory system, most notably by joining the Luddites"

How tales of a ""ceo monk"" obscure the more complex business of faith in China
For nearly two hours the monks sit folded in the loF F position, motionless and silent. All are robed in grey apart from the cherubic man in saffron, their leader. When the last joss-stick burns down, he glides out of the room without a word, later offering a brief explanation of the meditation: ""True wisdom emerges not from a calculating mind but from the wellspring of your heart."" It is the kind of line that might appear on a motivational poster. Voiced by this man, Shi Yongxin, the words sound heavier, weighed down by scandal.
Mr Shi is abbot of Shaolin Monastery, one of the world's best-known Buddhist shrines. Tourists flock there to see its warrior monks, impossibly flexible young men who fell imaginary foes with flying kicks beneath the craggy peaks of Mount Song. Founded 1,500 years ago, it is the cradle of kung fu and Zen Buddhism. But in recent years it has had more infamy than honour. Mr Shi has been criticised for transforming hallowed ground into a crass business venture. ""ceo monk"" is his moniker, appearing in headlines again and again. Who could resist it? Under Mr Shi, a monk with an mba, the monastery has expanded abroad and made plans to list on the stockmarket.
In 2015 the extent of his hypocrisy seemed to be revealed. Police opened an investigation after an accuser claimed that Mr Shi had enriched himself and violated his vows of celibacy. It was easy to dismiss the abbot as a sham, a venal man cloaked in religious garb. But Buddhist parables are rarely so straightforward.
Five years on, Mr Shi is still at Shaolin, cleared of all charges. He lives in a windowless room in its centre, looking less like a cunning mastermind than a quiet man of faith-one who may have renounced earthly desires but remains at the mercy of earthly forces. Religious institutions everywhere must negotiate between the articles of their belief and the realities of the world. In China that negotiation can get especially fraught.
When Mr Shi arrived at Shaolin at the age of 16, life there was much harsher. It was 1981, not long after the Cultural Revolution, when Mao Zedong had suppressed Buddhism and Red Guards had destroyed temples. Mr Shi found it in partial ruin. Just 20 monks lived there, subsisting on two steamed buns a day. Soon he had established himself as a lieutenant to its aged, nearly blind abbot. They trekked to government offices in Dengfeng, the monastery's home county, seeking permission to rebuild temple halls, to perform Buddhist rites and, crucially, to sell tickets.
In a remarkable twist of karma, Shaolin became a hot destination. In 1982 ""Shaolin Temple"", Jet Li's debut, hit the cinemas, depicting a foundational story: how 13 monks, supposedly skilled in kung fu, saved a future Tang dynasty emperor in battle. The monastery went from 50,000 visitors a year to 2m in 1984.
Kung fu is just one aspect of Shaolin-a physical discipline that accompanies chanting and meditation-but easily the most distinctive. Tales of its warrior monks have been popular since the 16th century. Knowing that kung fu was Shaolin's best hope for appealing to secular society, Mr Shi helped create a performing troupe in 1987.
From the outset, cross-cutting interests complicated matters. The main conflict was between the monks and the Dengfeng officials. For the monks, tourism was a financial lifeline to restore their monastery. For the officials, overseeing a poor county with half a million people, it was a kick-start for development. They squabbled over ticket sales. When the monks sold tickets at the temple's entrance, the officials erected a new gate 1km up the road, controlling access.
Shaolin also became a magnet for profiteers. People flooded in from nearby villages to open guesthouses, shops and karaoke parlours outside its walls. In the 1990s the streets around it turned into a small city, with 20,000 residents. Dozens of kung fu schools, claiming to be the heirs of its fighting tradition, sprung up. Companies around China used the monastery for branding: with ""Shaolin"" cigarettes, cars and, most gallingly for the vegetarian monks, ham and beer. ""We did not seek commercialisation. It was thrust upon us,"" says Mr Shi.
He sought advice from officials in Henan, Shaolin's province, about how to safeguard the monastery's image. The only answer, they concluded, was for Shaolin to lay claim to its name. In 1998 it established the Henan Shaolin Industrial Development Co as a vehicle to ? file for trademarks-for tea, furniture, hardware and more. Today, Shaolin owns nearly 700 trademarks.
Having swatted away the impostors, Shaolin emulated some of their techniques. The monastery produced a kung fu teaching mobile app, backed a fighting-monk movie and launched a line of traditional Chinese medicine. Mr Shi also joined a dozen monks on a short mba, a publicly funded course to hone their managerial skills. To its detractors Shaolin embodied the worst of modern China, an ancient religious order debased on the altar of riches. For Mr Shi the logic was-and remains-undeniable. ""This is how to make Buddhism relevant."" If the pope can televise daily mass, why can't a Shaolin monk seek publicity?
Karmic cycle
For a time Mr Shi was riding high. He was officially named abbot in 1999. The monastery grew to more than 200 monks. He worked out an agreement with Dengfeng county: 70% of ticket sales to the government, the rest to the monastery. Officials razed the streets around the temple, relocating the residents in town-a move that solidified Shaolin's bid for unesco world-heritage status, obtained in 2010. Shaolin became a weapon in China's soft-power arsenal. Mr Shi met Queen Elizabeth and Nelson Mandela. He was also skilled at aligning the monastery with the Communist Party. He made the case that Shaolin was not a religious threat but the government's humble servant, promoting Chinese culture. From 1998 to 2018 he was a deputy to the National People's Congress, the first representative of China's Buddhists in the rubber-stamp legislature.
Yet trouble was brewing. Dengfeng county officials wanted greater economic dividends from Shaolin. In 2009 they formed a joint venture with China National Travel Service (cnts), a big state-owned company. Dengfeng would inject its share of Shaolin ticket revenues into the venture; cnts would invest in local tourism infrastructure. Pointedly, the abbot did not show up at the company's inauguration ceremony. Word soon spread that Shaolin wanted to list on the stockmarket, raising as much as 1bn yuan ($150m). Media reported it as another extravagant example of the abbot's worship of mammon. There was just one problem: he was adamantly opposed, fearing it would make Shaolin a for-profit business. He asked questions that reached Beijing. Wen Jiabao, then China's prime minister, quashed the listing, saying it would harm Shaolin's identity.
The Dengfeng officials were furious. They saw Mr Shi as ""a monk who won't obey authority"", according to one intermediary. They started building a rival temple, to lessen their reliance on Shaolin. In May 2015 national authorities halted the project over concerns that it might damage the area's cultural heritage. Local media reported that it was the abbot who had again foiled the plans, though he denied that. Three months later, salacious accusations surfaced online. They were posted by ""Shi Zhengyi"", a self-described Shaolin monk whose pseudonym meant ""justice"". He accused the abbot of raping a businesswoman, having two children and embezzling millions.
The Henan government investigated Mr Shi but in 2017 exonerated him of all the main accusations. Evidence in the public domain had always been thin. Paternity tests revealed that neither child was Mr Shi's. Being China, though, doubts persisted about the investigation's credibility. Perhaps the abbot had mighty backers. Or perhaps China did not want to sully Shaolin's image. Yet those doubts were hard to square with the government's zest for corruption prosecutions in recent years. Xi Jinping, China's leader, has repeatedly shown that he believes that institutions matter more than any person (with the notable exception of himself). Surely, the same logic could apply to Shaolin.
With the abbot's name officially cleared, the obvious question was whether someone had framed him. Local police told him that they had identified suspects and asked whether they should pursue them. It was as if they were looking for his blessing to let the conspirators off the hook. Mr Shi obliged. ""What could I do as a monk? So long as I'm fine, I hope everyone is fine.""
For all the controversy about Shaolin, its most striking feature is its smallness. On an autumn afternoon, yellow leaves swirling around, a woman prostrates herself outside its gate, howling inconsolably. Inside, several buildings have warped roofs. The monks urinate in an open trough before entering the Chan Temple, its holiest site. ""Jing'an [a gold-trimmed temple in Shanghai] is worth ten Shaolins,"" says one.
And for all the headlines about Mr Shi's business acumen, there exist many examples of his restrained, even naive, approach to commerce. Shaolin's most notorious project was a $300m temple-and-hotel complex in Australia, including a 27-hole golf course. Mr Shi had thought the temple would bring Shaolin more followers. Instead, the golf plans-pushed, the abbot says, by local partners-brought scorn. Moreover, Shaolin never had the money to complete the project. It lent its name and seed funds, trusting its partners to raise the rest. Construction has yet to start.
There is money to be made in all the kung fu schools near Shaolin. One has more than 30,000 students. But Shaolin has no involvement in the big schools. They offer no Buddhism instruction and their graduates go on to serve in the armed forces or as bodyguards. Some members of the much smaller Shaolin fighting troupe have left to found their own schools. Mr Shi has limited sway over them. Occasionally he asks for donations- more supplicant than master.
cnts put its stake up for sale in October. It has lost money on Shaolin this year, with tourism hurt by the pandemic. But a dearth of bidders so far points to a deeper reason for the sale: the abbot has outmanoeuvred the investors. He has also read the changing political winds in Xi Jinping's China. In 2018, for the first time in its history, monks raised the national flag over Shaolin. At the ceremony Mr Shi pledged to do more to fuse Buddhism and Chinese culture, a message perfectly aligned with Mr Xi's prescriptions for religion.
At lunch the monks gather in a hall, sitting in neat rows. Mr Shi is alone on a raised platform, with apainting of a lion, jaws agape, on the wall behind him. For a second or two he looks fearsome. Then young monks come by with pots of rice and vegetable stew, slopping some into his bowl. Head down, he eats silently and quickly. In the afternoon a line-up of locals want to see him, to discuss personal problems and matters of faith. Some bring sweet potatoes as gifts; others apples or tea. Visitor numbers may be down, but those entering the monastery are, the abbot says, more serious about their Buddhism. ""This is what we want to see."" ·
For Mr Shi the logic was- and remains- undeniable. ""This is how to make Buddhism relevant"""

How 14 years in America's history reshaped the country along lines still contested today
On april 13TH1873 a group of armed white men rode into Colfax, Louisiana, a town around 200 miles north-west of New Orleans. Included in their number were members of the Ku Klux Klan and Knights of the White Camelia, both terrorist groups devoted to maintaining white rule across the American South. They were coming to seize the courthouse, then occupied by black and white Republicans who claimed victory in a disputed election the year before (Republicans were the party of Abraham Lincoln and emancipation). Republicans called on their supporters, most of whom in Colfax were black, to defend them.
The invaders were better armed, and laid down an enfilade of cannon fire. Some of the defenders fled. They were pursued and shot to death. Around 70 retreated into the courthouse, which the whites set ablaze. The courthouse's defenders extended from a window the sleeve of a shirt as a white flag. Emerging unarmed, 37 were taken prisoner. After dark, they and other prisoners were marched two-by-two away from the courthouse, told they were going to be set free. They too were shot, and left unburied for days. As many as 150 black Louisianans died that day.
The Colfax Massacre, as it came to be known, was not an isolated incident. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, racist terrorism swept across the South, targeting newly freed black Southerners and the whites believed to be helping them. This violence hastened the end of Reconstruction. Most historians define the period as beginning with the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, before the end of the civil war, and ending when Rutherford Hayes withdrew federal support in 1877 as part of a political bargain that put him in the White House.
Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Reconstruction began with unbridled enthusiasm among those who saw, in the defeat of the Confederacy and the end of slavery, a chance to remake the South, and compel America to live up to the promise of its founding documents. It ended in cowardice and compromise. Hayes's decision led to almost a century of white-supremacist rule across the South, which only began to crumble in the mid-20th century, as civilrights activists won court cases and pressured Congress and the president to pass and enforce legislation.
Reconstruction tends to get less attention than other foundational periods in American history, such as the founding and the civil war. Perhaps that is because, as an attempt to create an enduring multiracial democracy, it failed. But in the three Reconstruction amendments, and more broadly in the idea that the federal government should act as a guarantor of individual liberties, it planted the seeds of such a democracy. For that reason it remains central to American politics.
Reconstruction was a deeply contested undertaking. For lawmakers and elected officials, it was an attempt to answer a question that neither the constitu- ? tion nor American history had encompassed. Eleven states-in order of their secession, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee-seceded from and waged war against the United States. They were defeated. On what terms, how and when should they be readmitted to the Union?
Moderate Republicans favoured a quick reconciliation. Though Lincoln himself had a personal aversion to slavery, his principal interest as president was not ensuring equal rights for all Americans; it was winning the civil war and keeping the United States together. As he wrote to Horace Greeley, a publisher, in 1862, ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it...What I do about slavery, and the coloured race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.""
Many abolitionists-among them Frederick Douglass, born enslaved in Maryland and by the 1860s one of America's most celebrated authors and orators-recognised this position as untenable. To Douglass, ""the very stomach of this rebellion is the Negro in the condition of a slave."" He wanted enslaved Americans not just freed, but armed and trained to fight for the Union.
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
But Lincoln came to emancipation slowly, led by events more than principle. The border states (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and West Virginia after its creation in 1863) declined his entreaties for gradual emancipation backed by compensation to slave owners. His push to send African-Americans to Liberia, the Caribbean or Central America found few takers.
As the war progressed, the Union's need for soldiers grew. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation not only freed the enslaved, it also welcomed them into the army. Abolitionists recruited free African-Americans in the North, and in the South the Union's fighting forces included the formerly enslaved. According to Eric Foner, a historian, by the war's end 180,000 African-Americans had served in the Union Army.
Emancipation also bound the Union's success to slavery's demise. It seems obvious today that the two were always linked. After all, Alexander Stephens, the Confederacy's vice-president, called slavery the ""natural and normal condition"" of ""the Negro,"" who ""is not equal to the white man"". But, as Lincoln's vacillation demonstrates, it was then not so clear, and many hoped for some sort of political reconciliation between northern and southern states under which slavery would somehow naturally die out.
Almost a year after the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, Lincoln released his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction. This moderate plan promised readmission to Confederate states once 10% of their voters accepted abolition and swore loyalty to the Union. Once readmitted, states could draft new constitutions, form new governments and send federal representatives to Washington, dc.
The radical wing of Lincoln's party abhorred the plan. Wendell Phillips, an abolitionist, said that it ""frees the slave and ignores the Negro"", meaning that it made no provisions to aid the formerly enslaved, and said nothing about suffrage. But the border states also bristled; as Mr Foner notes, some Marylanders ""felt compelled to deny that voting for abolition implied 'any sympathy with Negro equality'"". This was not unusual; for many, abolition did not entail a belief in actual racial equality, just opposition to slavery.
Radical Republicans hoped that Andrew Johnson, who ascended to the presidency after Lincoln's assassination in 1865, would hew more closely to their view that Reconstruction required more than just emancipation. They were disappointed. Johnson, a Democrat whom Lincoln made his running-mate on a unity ticket, disliked ""slaveocracy"". He was also a bigot and a poor politician, and led his party to defeat in the elections of 1866 and 1867.
Though Radicals never made up a congressional majority, they held strong convictions and voted together while others wavered. They demanded full civil rights for freedmen, which few moderate Republicans did, and opposed compensating slaveholders. They also opposed any accommodation to slavery, such as the measures that would have preserved the Union at the cost of allowing slavery in newly admitted states.
After the 1867 elections, with Johnson weakened and Republicans holding a congressional majority, the Radicals' solidarity put them in charge of Reconstruction policy. The most prominent among them was Thaddeus Stevens, a congressman from Pennsylvania. He saw the former Confederacy as conquered territory and believed ""the whole fabric of southern society must be changed, and never can it be done if this opTo ? portunıty is lost."" The Radicals divided the South into five military districts. They required the states to write new constitutions; ratify the 14th amendment, which granted citizenship to anyone born on American soil or naturalised in the United States; and allow black men to vote.
In the South, black political mobilisation was already under way, having begun before the war's end. During Reconstruction, black electoral turnout often approached 90%. Former Confederate states elected over 2,000 black state and local officials and 185 black federal elected officials, including two senators from Mississippi (Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce) and 14 members of Congress, with the largest number coming from South Carolina. Louisiana's first and still only black governor, P.B.S. Pinchback, took office in 1872.
African-Americans in the South did not only vote for and seek office. Alongside white Republicans, they also rewrote their state constitutions, which as well as doing away with racially discriminatory laws also expanded state responsibility and civil liberties. Some established the South's first state-funded schools and made attendance compulsory. Others opened staterun orphanages and asylums, reduced the number of crimes punishable by death, recognised a wife's property rights independent of her husband and, in one state, authorised divorce.
The constitutional conventions and sizeable number of black elected officials were the fruits of rising black political mobilisation. Much like the civil-rights activists of the mid-20th century, they advocated for equal rights, and called on America to live up to its stated ideals. As one Alabama convention proclaimed, ""We claim exactly the same rights, privileges and immunities as are enjoyed by white men...The law no longer knows white nor black, but simply men.""
Pastoral scene of the gallant South
Northerners, both black and white, came south to organise, teach and help. Many of the newly emancipated joined branches of the Union League, a Republican-affiliated organisation. Others formed and joined organisations of their own. They built schools and churches, and advocated for land reform. As W.E.B. Du Bois, a sociologist and civil-rights activist, noted in his magisterial ""Black Reconstruction in America"", ""Black folk wanted two things-first, land which they could own and work for their own crops...In addition to that, they wanted to know...They were consumed with curiosity at the meaning of the world.""
Freedmen's desire for land made sense. They and their families had cleared and worked it without recompense, giving them a moral claim, and there was plenty of it. Much of the South was sparsely populated, and the war left many planters devastated and without the free labour that built their wealth. Mississippi and Louisiana auctioned off land in small parcels. But most states did little.
The new constitutions did not resolve every question that they raised. Most took no position on whether state-run schools should be integrated, though in every state, African-Americans opposed separating black and white pupils into different schools. Some used racially neutral language to facilitate discrimination. Georgia required jurors to be ""worthy and intelligent""-subjective terms that permitted local officials to bar African-Americans from juries. This pattern- broad agreement on principles, but backsliding over implementation-was a hint of the problems to come.
Recalcitrant white Southerners also fought against Reconstruction in three main ways. First, they aligned with moderate Republicans, who were less insistent on sweeping social changes than the Radicals. This cleaved southern Republicans in two camps, leaving the Radicals isolated, and brought Democrat-backed moderates into power across much of the South in the 1860s. And then, in the aftermath of the war, southern legislatures passed an array of ""Black Codes"" that curtailed freedom for the newly emancipated. These codes authorised arrest and forced labour for pseudocrimes such as ""vagrancy"" and ""malicious mischief"".
Mississippi required African-Americans to hold written proof of employment for the year. Any worker who left his employer before year's end would forfeit wages and be subject to arrest. South Carolina barred African-Americans from any job other than farmer or servant unless they paid a ""tax"" of up to $100 (over $1,600 today). In both cases these Black Codes did not take effect-the robust federal presence imposed by the Radicals and protests from Congress prevented it. But they indicated the depth of southern white opposition to racial equality, presaging the practices that came to be known as ""Jim Crow"" laws.
White Southerners also embarked on a campaign of racist terrorism, led by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Nowhere in the South did African-Americans escape terror's shadow. The terrorists were not, as legend maintained for decades, poor, uneducated whites, but as a newspaper editor from North Carolina remarked, ""men of property [and] respectable citizens"". State and local governments did little to stop the violence, which made them look weak and ineffective-a shared goal of the terrorists and the Democrats. 1
* The elections of 1872 returned Republicans to power in the White House and across much of the South. But Radical power was waning. Soon after winning reelection, President Ulysses Grant's support for their policies grew tepid. In the next presidential election, Reconstruction was not part of Republicans' platform; their candidate, Rutherford Hayes, promised to restore ""honest and capable local self-government"" to the South if elected. The threat of terrorism left many southern Republicans, as one from Mississippi complained, feeling ""helpless and unable to organise"".
Hayes's opponent was Samuel Tilden, the Democratic governor of New York, who like Hayes was not terribly popular. The election's results were disputed, marred by widespread violence and accusations of corruption. While Congress set up a commission to settle the dispute, Hayes's moderate Republican allies began negotiations with Southern Democrats. The two sides struck a bargain, the terms of which remain unknown, but which resulted in Hayes's inauguration, and an end to federal support for Reconstruction. This left the South, as a black Louisianan noted, in ""the hands of the very men that held us as slaves"".
Here is a strange and bitter crop
Many black Southerners feared that ""Redemption"", as whites called the end of Reconstruction, would lead to their re-enslavement. The 13th amendment, which outlawed slavery, prevented that-but only just. Men convicted of the flimsiest of crimes were leased to agricultural and industrial projects and forced to work without pay. Debt peonage kept rural African-American families bound to planters and merchants.
The 15th amendment barred explicitly denying black people the right to vote. Yet literacy requirements or poll taxes were often imposed in a racist way. An African-American could be deemed unfit to vote, for instance, if he failed to tell a white county clerk how many bubbles were in a bar of soap. When such tests failed, whites could always resort to violence without fear of conviction by all-white juries. By the mid-20th century, just 7% of Mississippi's black adult population was registered to vote.
Denial of the franchise led to a decline in the number of black officials. By the turn of the 20th century, Congress had just one black member: George Henry White of North Carolina, who left office in i90iafter his state, like the rest of the South, enacted laws restricting black suffrage. After Blanche Bruce of Mississippi left office in 1881, 86 years would pass before the next African-American-Edward Brooke of Massachusetts- served in the Senate. Not until 2013 would two elected African-Americans (Tim Scott of South Carolina and Cory Booker of New Jersey) serve in the Senate together. After John Lynch lost in 1882, it took almost a century for Mississippi, America's blackest state by share of population, to elect another black congressman, Mike Espy. After P.B.S. Pinchback left office in 1873, America would not see another black governor until 1990 when Virginians elected Douglas Wilder.
For years, the prevailing historical interpretation of Reconstruction-known as the Dunning School, after William Dunning, a professor who propounded it in the early 20th century-argued that it failed because black Southerners, in his words, ""exercised an influence in political affairs out of all relation to their intelligence"". In this view, slavery was not an inexcusable evil and a betrayal of America's founding ideals, but ""a modus vivendi through which social life was possible...[between] two races so distinct in their characteristics as to render coalescence impossible.""
By placing the blame for Reconstruction's failure on African-Americans, the Dunning School justified Jim Crow and legal segregation. It also undergirded the ""Lost Cause"" mythology propounded by the defeated South, which argued that it waged a defensive struggle against a tyrannical invader rather than an offensive war (the South fired the civil war's first shot) for the right to enslave others. Part of the cost of reconciliation was that in the decades immediately following Reconstruction's end, the civil war came to be seen as a battle between equally brave soldiers now at peace with each other, rather than, as Douglass wrote, ""a contest of civilisation against barbarism"".
Du Bois's study of Reconstruction, published in 1935, took aim at the Dunning School. Du Bois argued that Republicans and black Southerners laid the groundwork for a new and more activist conception of the state. They were the principal agents, politically and intellectually, of their own liberation. It was not their corruption or unpreparedness that condemned Reconstruction; it was implacable white opposition to democracy and devotion to racist rule backed by violence. That view, built upon by Mr Foner and others, now predominates.
Even so, some of the battle lines drawn by Reconstruction remain. President Donald Trump's exploitation of white racial grievance echoes that of the Redeemers, as does his fondness for Confederate iconography. Some on the right, including Mr Trump, oppose birthright citizenship. Revanchist white Southerners spent a century keeping African-Americans from voting, in defiance of the 15th amendment; as recently as 2013, Republicans in North Carolina tried to pass a voter id law that ""target[ed] African-Americans with almost surgical precision"", in the words of the judge who struck it down.
Although Reconstruction was a failure, it shaped the country in positive ways. After the civil war ended, the newly emancipated formed their own political organisations and churches-the latter of which would come to play a central role in the civil-rights movement of the mid-20th century and beyond. States such as Georgia, which had no state-funded school system before Reconstruction, would retain it after Redemption, though not until 1954 would the Supreme Court bar racial segregation in schools. The 14th amendment's Equal Protection Clause-which forbids ""any State [from denying] to any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws""-has been used to abolish segregated schools, anti-miscegenation rules and other racist laws.
Still, anyone who believes in American ideals will find it difficult to ponder Reconstruction's unfulfilled promise without grief and anger. The lament with which Du Bois ends his masterpiece remains sadly true today: ""If the Reconstruction of the Southern states, from slavery to free labour, from aristocracy to industrial democracy, had been conceived as a major national programme of America, whose accomplishment at any price was well worth the effort, we should be living today in a different world."" ·

Democracies need to re-learn the art of deception
Five hundred dummies descended on the French coast on the night of June 5th 1944. The crack of gunfire sounded from each one, courtesy of a small pyrotechnic device. As they thumped to the ground, explosive charges mimicked paratroopers setting their parachutes ablaze. The hessian invaders were the vanguard of a phantom army, the most ambitious conjuring trick in military history.
The Allied powers wanted to invade France, but did not want Germany to know where or when. So they put George Patton, a real general, in charge of the First United States Army Group, a made-up unit. The deception campaign was named Bodyguard, a sly reference to Winston Churchill's remark that: ""In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.""
Wooden landing craft, inflatable tanks and fake radio traffic hinted at a landing in Pas-de-Calais, some 300km (186 miles) from the Normandy beaches where the real troops would land. Set designers constructed a mock fuel depot in Dover, lent an air of authenticity by visits from King George and Dwight Eisenhower. An actor resembling General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the Allied land forces, was sent to North Africa to show that nothing was afoot. The trickery worked. Germany was taken by surprise on D-Day. Weeks later it still believed that Patton's imaginary force was poised to strike elsewhere.
Deception is still practised in war. In its conflict with Azerbaijan, Armenia has bamboozled drones with dummy missiles. During a stand-off with India, China published images of missile launchers that, on closer inspection, turned out to be wobbly inflatables. Indian and Chinese forces alike covered equipment with multispectral nets, which block visible light and other electromagnetic emissions. Engineers keep working on new gadgets. bae Systems, a defence firm, boasts that its Adaptiv camouflage-a set of thermoelectric tiles that change temperature to match their surroundings-amounts to a ""cloak of invisibility"".
But the operatic legerdemain of D-Day seems unlikely to be repeated. ""Deception in the West has become something of a lost art,"" laments General Sir Richard Barrons, who commanded Britain's joint forces until 2016. ""We've done some of these things in the past, like in World War II for example,"" reflected General Charles Q. Brown, the head of America's air force, in December 2019, ""but it's not something that we think about as much anymore."" The last major American effort was in the first Gulf war, when America tricked Saddam Hussein (and its own sailors) into expecting an attack from the sea. That comparatively simple feint involved showy amphibious exercises and the use of agents to spread misleading stories.
Although countries continue to spy, propagandise and sabotage, military deception-meaning fooling adversaries into doing things that harm their interests-appears to be declining. Three developments are ? to blame. Material factors have trumped human ones in war, technology has improved, and liberal democracies have become squeamish.
Modern war is a profession, waged by complex machines and officers capable of wielding them. By contrast, deception is closer to an artistic enterprise. It was zoologists, equipped with the lessons of animal colouration, and artists, inspired by Cubism and its shattering of perspective, who developed the avant-garde patterns of early camouflage. The most striking was the zebra-like dazzle applied to warships during and after the first world war, which obscured their speed and heading. Pablo Picasso claimed credit for the French army's adoption of camouflage.
During the second world war, Britain's Camouflage Development and Training Centre gathered what Peter Forbes, author of ""Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage"", calls ""a strange medley of characters"", including architects, naturalists, Surrealist painters and a magician. In America, a ""Ghost Army"", whose work was classified until 1996, hired actors and artists to generate special effects on the battlefield, such as speakers to simulate the sound of approaching tanks. Many went on to careers in art and fashion, says Jennifer McArdle of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington, dc.
But melding such madcap experimentation with the discipline and order of military culture is difficult. The ending of national service and conscription in most large Western armies has deepened the fissure between military and civilian life. And America's sheer power has led it to a direct way of war. ""The us has the tendency to use technology and brute force in the absence of creativity,"" says Ms McArdle.
At the same time, technology has made grand ruses harder to sustain. Warfare is increasingly ""a competition between hiding and finding"", noted Britain's chief of defence staff in September. The ability to find has advanced considerably. Satellites and drones gaze down, antennae-laden soldiers and vehicles hoover up electronic emissions and amateur plane-spotters track military movements on social media.
Had today's commercial satellite industry existed 30 years ago, Saddam could have purchased high-resolution images that would have revealed American troops massing on his border. And today's sensors see details that human eyes miss. A thermal infrared camera on a drone can easily tell a cool rubber decoy from a hot metal tank; long-wavelength infrared sensors can detect buried weapons by the different reflectance of disturbed soil. Even sophisticated decoys could become vulnerable to machine-learning algorithms that, fed with sufficient examples, tease out anomalies too subtle for a human analyst to spot. And a deceiver must successfully deceive in more ways. Conjuring a phoney battalion now requires generating not only fake radio traffic but also social-media activity.
Would-be deceivers can also invest in technology, perhaps by putting temperature-changing tiles on tanks. But human errors are a perennial problem. ""If a soldier gets bored and walks out from their position with thermal screens to go to the toilet, an enemy will find it very amusing to suddenly have someone appear from nowhere,"" says Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, another think-tank. Western armies are particularly dependent on radio communications, he says, leaving a tell-tale map of electronic signatures.
Yet some of the old ruses still work. As late as 1999, during the war over Kosovo, when nato jets flew at high altitudes to avoid being shot down, Serbia showed that they could be fooled into wasting bombs on fake tanks. Russia's forces have platoons that spray smoke and aerosols designed to block ultraviolet, infrared and radar. And as bae's Adaptiv shows, active camouflage is improving.
Instead of achieving security through obscurity, the best hope for modern deceivers may be to drown their pursuers in noise, forcing them to waste expensive precision weapons on cheap decoys. Flocks of drones and ground robots might spew forth electromagnetic emissions, challenging enemy sensors to pick the wheat from the chaff. Armies might even seek to exploit what is called ""adversarial"" artificial intelligence to generate camouflage patterns and designs that confound object-detection algorithms.
Little green men
The biggest problem is not that brute force is supplanting artistry, or that technology is denuding secrecy. The complaint heard most often in Western armies is simply that rivals have more of a stomach for deception. Perhaps, they suggest, open societies that prize the rule of law and transparency at home are inherently less good at trickery.
European and American military officials describe Russian and Chinese practices with a mixture of distaste and envy. Whereas America's use of decoys ""is currently at a low after two decades of neglect"", notes Walker Mills, an officer in the us Marine Corps, China has invested in them, including a 35kg tank that fits in a backpack and inflates in four minutes. One report by America's army says that Chinese forces ""have the highest fidelity decoys seen to date"".
The laws of armed conflict are fairly clear about battlefield deception. Whereas ""perfidy"" (such as faking surrender to lure an enemy into an ambush, or disguising a tank as a Red Cross ambulance) is forbidden, ""ruses"" like decoys, feints and ambushes are fair game. But other laws can be bent or bypassed. Russia snatched Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 by cleverly using unmarked personnel-the so-called little green men-and a synchronised blitz of disinformation. The entire campaign was a deception: an invasion masquerading as a nationalist uprising.
Western armies want to catch up, in some ways at least. ""We'll re-learn deception,"" promises General David Berger, head of America's Marine Corps, who is reforming his force to better evade Chinese sensors in the Pacific. But this cuts against the grain. ""There's a cultural problem here,"" says a veteran cia officer who specialised in deception. ""I do think you'll find generals who would feel that it's fundamentally not a very respectable activity.""
Such anxieties point to a deeper fear that despotic rule-breakers will steal an edge. In 1943 Britain tricked Germany into believing that the Allies would invade Greece by dressing a dead homeless man as a Royal Marines officer and releasing the corpse, stuffed with misleading orders, onto the coast of neutral Spain. ""We'd still be prepared to use a dead enemy soldier,"" says a nato officer. ""But the Russians and Chinese would be prepared to kill him to do it.""
Modern war is a profession. By contrast, deception is closer to an artistic enterprise"

One Russian scientist's ambitious plan to slow the thawing of the Arctic
Perched on top of a cliff on the northern edge of Russia, Sergei Zimov doffs his beret, letting his long grey hair tumble down his back. His eyes glow as he leans his weathered face toward the frozen ground. Under the haze of never-ending northern days, he looks like a figure lifted from the golden background of a Russian Orthodox icon.
Mr Zimov, whose name comes from the Russian word for ""winter"", lives with his wife Galina in a simple wooden house outside Chersky, an outpost in Russia's outer reaches, farther north than Reykjavik and farther east than Tokyo. Inside their home, woolly-mammoth tusks lie scattered across the bedroom floor. The Kolyma river beckons from the window. This is a land unsuited for human life, where temperatures dip below minus 50°C in winter and where mosquitoes blacken the skies in summer. ""To be a prophet, you must live in the desert,"" says Mr Zimov.
In the Soviet era, few travelled down the Kolyma of their own volition. The region had a reputation as one of the harshest, iciest corners of the gulag. By the time the Zimovs moved there in 1980, the camps had shut down but the frost remained. For the first few years, they lived without electricity, using kerosene lamps and drawing water from the river. Chersky's remoteness had its benefits. ""We felt very free here,"" Galina says, away from the eyes of the Communist Party. Drawing on a degree in geophysics and a contrarian spirit, Mr Zimov co-founded the Northeast Science Station (ness) for Arctic research, and began a lifetime of studying the far north.
In the mid-1980s, he predicted that the Soviet Union would collapse. He stocked up on supplies. ""When there's a drought, the farthest branches dry up first,"" he explains. He boasts of other premonitions, such as the oil-price crash in 2014. He tells anyone who will listen to invest in gold.
Kolyma tales
But it is the ecological apocalypse that worries Mr Zimov most. For more than 20 years, he and his son, Nikita, have been populating a stretch of 160 square km (62 square miles) that they call Pleistocene Park with yaks, horses, sheep, oxen and other grazing animals. Mr Zimov reckons the beasts will uproot and trample the shrubs, moss and larch trees that cover the area, clearing the way for grasslands of the kind that spread during the Pleistocene epoch, the glacial geological period that began 2.6m years ago and ended 12,000 years ago. He argues that this will slow the thawing of permafrost, a process that leads to the release of greenhouse gases that could accelerate climate change. ""I am building an ark,"" he says, describing his project in grand metaphorical terms-and without a hint of irony.
Nearly one-quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, an area twice the size of America, sits on top of ground made up of soil that remains frozen for at least two years at a time. One 18th-century explorer described iron spades breaking when they hit it. Mikhail Sumgin, a Soviet-era scientist who pioneered the study of the frozen earth, often referred to it as ""the Russian sphinx"". The technical term for it, permafrost, is a translation of Sumgin's Russian turn of phrase, vechnaya merzlota, or the eternal frost.
It is not as permanent as once believed. While Earth is warming at an alarming speed, the Arctic is warming more than twice as fast. Across the region, the ground is beginning to give way, warping roads, buildings, pipelines, coastlines and river banks.
The damage to infrastructure and livelihoods above ground is worrying enough. But another danger lies below the surface: rich deposits of organic material, such as old plant roots and animal carcasses, which have been preserved in the ice over millions of years. When permafrost thaws, that organic material turns into food for microbes, which convert it into carbon dioxide and methane. Those gases accelerate the planet's warming, which speeds the thawing of permafrost, a feedback loop with potentially disastrous consequences. ""We can get off fossil fuels, we can stop chopping down trees, but with permafrost it's a secondary effect,"" says Robert Max Holmes, deputy director of the Woodwell Climate Research Centre, an American think-tank. ""It's not anything we're doing directly, and that makes it far harder to control.""
Cold as ice
Northern permafrost contains as much as i,6oobn tonnes of carbon, or twice as much carbon as is currently found in the atmosphere and three times as much as is locked in the world's forests. That carbon pool is often referred to as a ""bomb"", but permafrost behaves more like a leaky pipe. How much and how fast the pipe will leak depends on myriad factors-not least humankind's willingness to reduce its own greenhouse-gas emissions.
Estimates vary widely. Some argue that if climatechange mitigation efforts succeed, permafrost could sequester more carbon than it releases; others see permafrost becoming a net emitter, albeit a tiny one compared with human beings. But if humans continue spewing greenhouse gases at current rates, widely accepted models predict that 5-15% of the permafrost's carbon reserves could be released this century, increasing global warming by as much as 0.27°C. To even have a chance of limiting global warming to i.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a un body, gives society a carbon ""budget"" of 58obn tonnes; the emissions from permafrost could use up roughly one-quarter of that amount.
Even the best estimates struggle to capture the complexity of how permafrost thaws, a process researchers are only beginning to understand. Most climate scientists' models assume that it will thaw evenly, a few centimetres at a time over decades across vast areas, a process known as ""gradual thaw"". But permafrost experts also worry about melting pockets of ice causing rapid erosion, or ""abrupt thaw"". Landscapes collapse and sinkholes open up, exposing layers of permafrost with richer stores of carbon to ever warmer temperatures. Water can also pool in those collapsed areas, forming ""thermokarst"" lakes above layers of unfrozen soil. Such environments tend to attract microbes that produce methane. The more permafrost is studied, the more scientists find ""surprises out there that we don't know enough about"", says Ted Schuur of Northern Arizona University.
Along the river south of Chersky, Mr Zimov demonstrates how different some parts of permafrost are from one another. The permafrost's structure here is more honeycomb than layer-cake. Rather than melting evenly across a flat service, water drips between and forms ice around polygon-shaped cores. When the ice begins to thaw, it exposes the gaps between the pylons, leaving the ground looking like a mogul course on a ski slope. Mr Zimov compares the process to ""cracks spreading in clay, or on the canvases of Old Masters"".
Few people have done more to unravel the riddles of the Russian sphinx. ""Every scientist now appreciates the importance of the carbon in the permafrost,"" says Mr Holmes. ""A lot of that can be traced to Zimov.""
In 1993 Mr Zimov and a group of Russian co-authors published a paper in the American Geophysical Union's Journal of Geophysical Research, arguing that carbon was escaping from Arctic permafrost's active layer in the winter, not just in the summer, as previously believed. Scientists began travelling to Chersky to conduct their own research. Together with a group of American collaborators, Mr Zimov published a series of papers showing that permafrost contained far larger stores of greenhouse gases than previously thought. ""Every time we talked to Sergei about something that just seemed off the wall, sooner or later he'd convince us,"" says F. Stuart Chapin, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and one of his co-authors.
Mr Zimov also privatised the ness and built it into a global hub. Managing an international research station in the Arctic presents a logistical challenge in the best of circumstances. In post-Soviet Russia, it required a combination of resourcefulness and wiliness. Bruce Forbes of the Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland recalls ""post-apocalyptic scenes of kids setting fire to abandoned buildings for fun"" during a visit to Chersky in the 1990s. ""At the time he went to that place, it was the end of the world,"" says Vladimir Romanovsky, head of the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""He turned it into one of the best research stations in the permafrost area.""
Nonetheless, Mr Zimov remains a polarising figure. His brusque demeanour has alienated many. ""My father is not a very diplomatic man,"" Nikita sighs, with the weight of experience. His brash persona and wild theories about the wider world can overshadow his scientific insights. Mr Zimov hails from a scientific tradition in Russia that tends towards grand, sweeping theories that span disciplinary boundaries. He evokes early 20th-century Russian polymaths, such as Vladimir Vernadsky, who made pioneering advances in geochemistry, developed the concept of the biosphere and embraced Russian Cosmism, a movement that sought to cure death and conquer the stars. Mr Zimov tends to begin from his ideas and to measure only enough to persuade himself that he was right. ""He'd be fine with a sample size of one,"" says Mr Chapin. That can unsettle Western scientists, who place a premium on data and who operate within hyper-specialised fields.
What Mr Zimov lacks in rigorous data, he just about makes up for with a deep engagement in the environment. At one of his test sites downriver, he taps the earth with a long metal pole to show where permafrost begins. He can tell what state the ground is in by the sound it makes. In 2018 the Zimovs observed that the active layer of permafrost was no longer freezing over in the winter. The average temperature at their test sites was eight degrees warmer than just a decade ago, rising from -6°C to +2°C. Across the Bering Strait in Alaska, Mr Romanovsky has been observing similar phenomena at dozens of sites.
To peek underneath the active layer, Mr Zimov travels a few hours downriver to a site called Duvanny Yar. A sulphurous stench fills the air. Millions of years of geological history stand exposed along the river. Mr Zimov picks up abone: ""Mammoth.""
Back when woolly mammoths roamed Earth, the far north resembled a modern-day African Savannah. Thick grasslands stretched across Siberia, Alaska and the Canadian Yukon, where herds of herbivores grazed. Along with mammoth, there were bison, horses, elk and reindeer. Wolves and cave lions kept the populations in check. Yet as the Pleistocene gave way to the Holocene, the large herbivores died out. And as they disappeared, the landscape was transformed. The dry grasses turned into wet, mossy tundra.
One long-standing explanation for the mass extinction holds that the warming climate was the culprit. Mr Zimov, however, believes that the milder climate only facilitated the arrival of the true villains. Writing in American Naturalist in 1995, he argued that human hunting led to the extinction of the megafauna throughout the far north.
As Mr Zimov sees it, reversing that process and reviving the grasslands could be the key to preserving permafrost. Doing so would mean reintroducing large mammals that could tamp down moss, knock down trees, and churn up the soil, allowing the grass to flourish again. Grass could reflect more light and reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the soil; it could also capture more carbon in its roots than today's flora.
That logic underlies Pleistocene Park. Mr Zimov wants to extend the park through Alaska to Canada. He and his son even dream of hosting woolly mammoths one day, and have formed a partnership with George Church, of Harvard University, who hopes to revive the ancient beasts using crispr gene-editing technology.
Several aspects of Mr Zimov's theories seem to hold up, though they may appear paradoxical. Take the trees he wants to eradicate. In temperate regions, trees sequester carbon, and cutting them down releases it into the atmosphere. In the far north, more carbon is stored below ground than in the sparse forests. Removing trees there could have a net positive effect by keeping permafrost cooler and preventing the organic material trapped in it from breaking down. So, too, with the warming effects of snow, which Mr Romanovsky calls ""a huge insulator"". At his test sites around Fairbanks, thick winter snow can raise ground temperatures by between three and five degrees. Mr Zimov reckons the animals could also help to pack down the snow in the winter, reducing that effect.
The ark of history
Results from Pleistocene Park are promising. The current mixture of Yakutian horses, bison, musk oxen, elk, reindeer, sheep, yak and Kalmyk cattle have helped grasslands re-emerge. Average annual soil temperatures are 2.2°C cooler in grazed areas. More carbon is also being sequestered in the upper layer of soil in those areas, too.
For advocates of radical rewilding, the Zimovs suggest a tantalising sense of possibility. ""The issue now is scaling,"" says Mr Forbes of the University of Lapland. ""How many animals would you actually need?"" A group of researchers from the University of Oxford, working with Nikita, published a study in 2020 that concluded that rewilding the Arctic to a degree that would have a major impact on emissions would be a ""mammoth task"". It would mean reintroducing thousands of animals and would need support from governments and residents. A ten-year feasibility study involving roughly 3,000 animals would cost $ii4m.
Some see all this effort and expense as a distraction from the focus on reducing overall emissions, the surest way to keep the planet-and permafrost-from warming. Sceptics wonder whether grasslands will work to preserve permafrost, or whether the grazing animals will not have other side-effects, too.
The Zimovs remain determined to continue. Their operations depend largely on their sheer force of will. Nikita once raised more than $100,000 through crowdfunding to bring a herd of 12 bison to the park, driving them himself from Denmark to Chersky, where they arrived on a barge just after midnight one night in midJune 2019, when your correspondent was visiting.
After the bison were released, the Zimovs retreated to the mess hall of the research station to celebrate. They poured a round of samogon, a potent Russian homebrew, and toasted the animals' health. (All the bison survived their first winter.) Mr Zimov stepped outside to smoke, taking a seat below the giant satellite dish that has crowned the station since Soviet times. ""Before it was for connecting with the Party, now it's for connecting with God,"" he laughs, pointing to the dish. ""God is sending us signals: gather the animals.""

Tricking the brain about where a recorded sound is coming from can enrich the listener's experience
Human beings are good at locating the sources of sounds. Even when blindfolded, most people can point to within ten degrees of the true direction of a sound's origin. This is a useful knack for evading danger. It is also an extraordinary cerebral feat. Partly, it is a matter of detecting minute differences of volume in each ear. Partly, it comes from tiny disparities in the time it takes a sound to reach two ears that are not equidistant from its source. The heavy lifting of sound-location, however, involves something else entirely.
Audio buffs call it the head-related transfer function. A sound is modulated by the body parts it encounters before it reaches the eardrums. In particular, the various tissues of the head attenuate higher frequencies, weakening the top notes of sound waves that have passed to an eardrum through the skull compared with those from the same source that have arrived directly through the air. The cartilaginous ridges, troughs and protuberances of the outer ear also alter sound before it is transduced into nerve signals. Sounds arriving from different angles are therefore modified in consistent ways that the brain learns to recognise.
For all of their acoustic spatial awareness, however, brains can still be fooled by appropriate technology into believing a sound is coming from somewhere that it is not. That sounds like the basis of a big business. And it is.
Sounds good
One way to simulate the ""immersive"" sound of reality through a pair of earbuds is by using a pair of recordings made with microphones embedded in the ear canals of a special dummy head. These heads are made to have the same shape and density as those of their flesh-and-blood counterparts. That means they modulate sound waves passing through them in a realistic manner. Recordings made using them therefore log what would arrive at the ear canals of someone listening to the sound in question for real. When they are played back, what a user hears recapitulates that experience, including the apparent directions from which the sounds are coming.
Dummy-based binaural recordings of this sort have been around for a while. But making them is clunky. It is also expensive. A good dummy head can cost $10,000, and time in a professional recording studio is hardly cheap. These days, though, the process can be emulated inside a computer. And that is leading to a creative explosion.
The trick that the emulator must master is a process called phase modulation. This involves retarding a sound's high, medium and low frequencies by the slight but varying fractions of a second by which those frequencies would be delayed by different parts of the ears and head in reality. So writing the appropriate software starts by collecting a lot of data on how sound waves interact with a human head, and that means going back to the studio to conduct special binaural recordings, often using people instead of dummies. The resulting signals can then be decomposed into their component frequencies, which yields an understanding of how to modulate a given frequency to make it seem as if it is arriving from a particular location. 1
* Demand for software to mix sound in this way has shot up says Lars Isaksson of Dirac Research, a firm in Uppsala, Sweden. Dirac developed its own version of such software, known as Dirac 3D Audio, by using a year's worth of recordings it made that encompassed each degree of rotation, both side to side and up and down, around a listener's head. This panaudicon provided, Mr Isaksson says, notable smoothness in the simulated movement of sound sources. Makers of video games are a big market for such stuff.
Dirac is not alone. Half a dozen other firms, including Dolby Laboratories of America and Sennheiser of Germany, also now make immersive software. To use it, a sound engineer employs a graphic interface that includes a representation of a sphere surrounding an icon representing the listener. The engineer uses a mouse to move sound channels-vocals, percussion and so on, if the product is music-to the points in the sphere from which their outputs are intended to originate. Software of this sort provides a way to take any recording and ""project it in 3D"", says Véronique Larcher, co-director of Sennheiser's division for immersive audio.
Sennheiser's product is called ambeo. Dolby's is called Atmos. This has generated the soundtracks of more than 20 video games and 2,500 films and television shows, as well as many pieces of music. Immersive sound may even come to videoconferencing. Dirac is promoting software that makes the voices of participants seem to emerge from the spots on the screen where their images appear. The software uses a laptop's camera to track listeners' heads. To those who look, say, left, it will sound as though their interlocutors are off to the right. Dirac is in talks with videoconferencing firms including BlueJeans, Lifesize and Zoom.
Facebook, a social-media company, is also designing ""spatialised audio"" for video calls that use its Oculus virtual-reality headsets. Ravish Mehra, head of audio research at Facebook Reality Labs, is coy about how long it will take his team to perfect the aural illusion that this is intended to create. But he says software the firm has in development can modify the frequencies and volumes of sounds so that they match the virtual surroundings chosen for a call, as well as the speaker's perceived position. The acoustics of a beach, he notes, are unlike those of a room.
Tin pan alley
Such stuff is for the professionals. But amateurs can play too. For the man or woman in the street who wants to jazz up a record collection, many simpler programs now permit people to give a more immersive feeling to their existing recordings by running them through software that modulates the sounds of those recordings to achieve that end.
Programs of this sort cannot handle different parts of a recording differently in the way that studio-based systems manage, but they do create an illusion of sonic space around the listener. Isak Olsson of Stockholm, who has put together two such packages, 8d Audio and Audioalter, describes them as seeming to increase the size of the room. This helps to overcome a phenomenon known as the ""in-the-head experience"". And, as Michael Kelly, head of engineering at Xperi, an immersive-software firm based in California, observes, sounds that appear to come from outside the head are more comfortable.
At the other end of the technological scale from such do-it-yourself kits, a number of firms, Dirac, Dolby, Facebook, Sony and Xperi among them, are working on a bespoke approach to sonic immersion. They are tailoring it, in other words, to an individual listener's anatomy.
One method, that being used by Sony, is to ask potential customers to upload photographs of their ears. Another, which may be adopted by Xperi, is to repurpose data from the face-recognition systems that now unlock many people's smartphones. If this way of thinking works, it will bring with it the ultimate in high fidelity. This is a recognition that, in the real world, even if what they are hearing is the same set of sound waves, every listener's experience is different-and that this needs to be replicated in the world of recorded sound, too. With that realisation, acknowledgment of the head-related transfer function's importance has reached its logical conclusion. And the term ""headbanging"" may take on a new and positive meaning. *"

Some crops can absorb phosphorus from dust
Wheat was among the first plants to be domesticated and is now the most widespread crop in the world. It thus sounds unlikely there would be much left to learn about what makes it thrive. Yet, some 12,000 years after relations between people and wheat began, a wheat plant has been caught doing something unexpected. It helped itself to a dose of much-needed phosphorus when its leaves received a coating of desert dust.
The plant (or, rather, plants) in question were in the care of Avner Gross of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in Israel. As Dr Gross told this year's meeting of the American Geophysical Union, which took place online during the first half of December, his study was prompted by hikes he had taken near Neve Shalom, his home village in the Judean Hills. On these, he often noticed plant leaves completely covered in dust that had been carried there by sand storms from the Sahara desert.
It occurred to him that this dust might not be the light-blocking nuisance it appeared at first sight. It could, on the contrary, be beneficial because of the growthenhancing elements such as phosphorus which it contained. Until then, botanists had assumed that phosphorus in dust landing on a plant was of little value, because it is locked up in an insoluble mineral called apatite. This makes it unavailable for absorption. Dr Gross, however, reasoned that plants which had evolved near deserts, the source of almost all naturally occurring dust in the atmosphere, might well have evolved a way to exploit it.
He and two colleagues, Sudeep Tiwari, also at Ben Gurion, and Ran Erel of the Gilat Research Centre, therefore started experimenting with a pair of species, wheat and chickpeas (the world's 17th most planted crop), that both came originally from the Middle East. As a control, they also raised some maize, a plant from the Americas that evolved in far less dusty surroundings.
First, having established them as seedlings, they starved their charges of phosphorus until signs of deficiency such as yellow leaves appeared. Then they scattered desert dust on the leaves of half of the specimens of each species, while taking steps to stop any of it reaching the soil. After this, though the dust-dosed maize continued to suffer from phosphorus deficiency, the wheat and chickpea plants perked up and grew to more than double the size of their undusted lab-mates. What is more, these species were clearly ready for the dust's arrival. As soon as a lack of phosphorus announced itself, two things happened. Their leaves became hairier, and therefore better at capturing dust. And those leaves also started secreting acid fluids that could dissolve any incoming apatite, assisting phosphorus's absorption.
That plants can take up phosphorus through their leaves is not, of itself, news to farmers-for this was established in the 1950s. But until now the practical consequence of such knowledge has been that crops are sprayed with liquid fertiliser derived, in turn, from apatite-containing rocks which have been treated with acid. Dusting leaves could, Dr Gross suggests, be an alternative and more efficient way of providing desert-derived crop species with the phosphorus they need. And maybe not just those. His next plan is to look at avocado and cocoa trees, which evolved in tropical regions of the Americas that regularly get a helpful transatlantic dose of Saharan dust carried westward by the trade winds. It will be interesting to see if they are up to the same tricks as wheat and chickpeas. *

Magnetic tape is an old-fashioned technology with a promising future
The whirr of spooling magnetic tape is more likely to evoke feelings of nostalgia than technological awe. Yet tape remains important for data storage, with millions of kilometres of the stuff coiled up in the world's data centres. Indirectly, says Mark Lantz of ibm, most computer users thus rely on tape every day.
Though tape may seem archaic, it is still getting better. In 2015 Dr Lantz's team unveiled a version capable of squirrelling away 123 gigabytes per square inch (19Gb per square centimetre, but tapemakers still use Imperial units). In 2017 they reached 201Gb/in2. And on December 15th they revealed a design that has a density of 317Gb/in2. That rate of growth is unmatched by any of tape's competitors.
Tape's heyday as a data-storage medium for computers was in the 1950s. Hard disks, introduced in 1956, were quickly seen as superior because they required no timeconsuming spooling. Decades of selective investment mean they now also have a better density of information storage than tape. The best can manage more than 1,000Gb/in2. As a result they are in high demand-2018 saw the sale of more than 800bn gigabytes-worth, which is eight times the figure for tape. But disks have drawbacks. They are costlier than tape, have shorter lifespans and their spinning platters generate far more unwanted heat.
This leads to tape being the medium of choice for the so-called ""cold"" storage of data that need to be looked at only infrequently. And disks' advantages elsewhere may be slipping. In the 1990s hard-disk storage densities doubled every year. Over the past decade that rate of growth has dropped to 7.6%, as manufacturers run out of headroom. Smaller magnetic particles need more energy to keep them in line, and the magnets which provide this are approaching the theoretical limits of their strength. The storage density of magnetic tape, by contrast, has been increasing steadily, by 34% a year for nearly three decades. As a consequence, tape may catch up with hard disks within five years.
To maintain this blistering rate of growth, Dr Lantz's team concentrated on three matters. First, they reduced the size of the magnetic grains that form a tape's recording surface, by substituting strontium ferrite for the current industry standard of barium ferrite. Second, they shrank the size of the read heads by a factor of 30, permitting data to be packed onto narrower tracks. Third, they developed systems able to track and correct the position of the tape with nanometre accuracy as it flowed under the smaller heads, stopping it going offtrack and distorting the signal. Though it may take a decade for these technological improvements to make their way into products, this sort of progress bolsters confidence in tape's long-term utility.
Other innovations may be coming, too. Ohkoshi Shin-ichi of the University of Tokyo, for example, advocates using particles of epsilon iron oxide. This material is particularly magnetically stable, meaning its grain-size can be reduced (and thus storage density increased) without any risk of the field flipping randomly and thus changing what is encoded.
Taped up
Demand for more storage will certainly be there. Estimates suggest that four times more data will be generated in 2025 than in 2019. In the part of the data-storage market where tape currently reigns supreme, it is likely to remain so for a while.
The biggest threat to tape comes from the flash-drive technology used in sd cards and usb sticks. Flash relies on a flow of electrons through transistors, rather than on magnetised particles read by mechanical components, so it is capable of better data densities even than hard disks. Lack of moving parts also makes such solid-state devices faster at writing and retrieving information. Flash drives are, however, more costly than magnetic storage and do not last as long. This makes them ten times more expensive per byte per year of storage than hard disks, and nearly 50 times more expensive than tape. They are therefore too dear to use for anything but the most important jewels in the data vault. Until that changes, the reel is likely to continue. *"

It was march 2017 and fans were streaming out of a concert by Craig David at the O2 Arena in London and into North Greenwich Tube station. As they jovially belted out their favourite tunes, an ode to the pop star, crammed with song titles and catchy rhymes, appeared on a whiteboard in the ticket hall. A crowd soon surrounded the board, giggling and taking selfies.
Hundreds of rhymes have since been posted mysteriously around London's Underground network, each signed ""@allontheboard"". The poems-written, it transpires, by two Tube workers-range from life lessons to dad jokes. A ditty tackling men's mental-health problems is dedicated to ""sad lads, broken blokes, unhappy chappies"". A ""Fruit & Veg Guide to Life"" urges: ""Don't be bananas, give peas a chance, we can turnip around.""
In their day jobs, the two subterranean poets usher people through turnstiles and control crowds. But even before turning to verse, they confide in an interview, they sought ways to add a flicker of fun to their shifts, for instance challenging one another to drop pop-song titles into responses to customers' inquiries. A request for directions could be met with a hand cupped behind an ear and ""Hit me baby one more time?"" After the night of the concert, they realised that they could lift commuters' spirits with their poems. They began wheeling spare whiteboards into quiet tunnels to write. To maintain their anonymity they donned masks, long before those became mandatory on public transport because of covid-19.
And to cultivate mystique, they adopted the noms de plume N1 and Ei, a play on London's system of postcodes and shorthand for ""No one"" and ""Everyone"". Referring to the feted street artist, N1 explains that they ""quite liked the idea of being like the Banksys of the Underground"".
First they needed permission to display their poems on spare boards where passengers could see them. The city's transport authority previously had tight rules for the use of its whiteboards: only service messages, no underlining, just a handful of regulation coloured pens. But managers were persuaded to make an exception, and before long station bosses began asking the men to brighten up ticket halls with a poem. Supportive colleagues juggle shifts to make sure they are on duty together. They are best-known for their tributes to celebrities, especially those appearing at the O2, which they pack with song and film titles, puns and quotes.
Looking on the bright side
Less than four years after their debut, they have more than 500,000 followers on Instagram. Fans include a young woman in Turkey who reads the poems online to practise her English, an Iranian girl seeking positivity as she battles suicidal thoughts, Brits abroad who crave a taste of home, and assorted stars. A poem studded with quotes from Michelle Obama was spotted by her staff during a book tour in London; the for- mer First Lady posted a picture of the board on Instagram. Performing in the city, Katy Perry, a singer, put on a baseball cap and dark glasses and rode the Tube to snap a photo with a board dedicated to her. ""You know you've made it once you're on one of those boards,"" N1 says.
In November the pair finally discarded their masks (metaphorically, at least) and revealed their true identities when they published an anthology of their writing, also called ""All on the Board"". Niis a former train driver named Ian Redpath; Ei is his pal, Jeremy Chopra. One reason they are so good at cheering up commuters, they reveal, is that they have sometimes needed cheering up themselves. Their sympathy for health problems such as tinnitus and colitis derives from personal experience.
In a harrowing recollection, for instance, Mr Redpath tells of the day a woman threw herself in front of his train, leaving him with post-traumatic stress disorder that ended his career as a driver. ""When she jumped, our eyes connected, and she smiled just before the train hit her,"" he remembers. ""I was scared of the dark for ages. I was scared of seeing her face in my dreams."" Sharp-elbowed Londoners tend to spare little thought for the harried staff on the Tube; this poignant anthology humanises them.
The pandemic is an eerie time for both the rhymesters and their normally teeming workplace. At the moment there may be more mice in Tube stations than there are passengers; ridership sank to just 4% of normal levels in April and May, during London's first full lockdown, and it remains low. But All on the Board think their mission to boost morale is as important as ever. The duo have continued to put up poems throughout the year, writing sonnets to thank doctors, congratulate people celebrating lonely birthdays and reminisce about the forbidden joys of hugging. ""Life is a journey,"" one board reflects, ""and at the moment/the train we are all on is in a tunnel,/But, one day we will see the light.""
Some of these pandemic-themed offerings feature in the book, rhyming ""alive"" with ""survive"" and ""friends"" with ""ends"". But the best parts of the anthology involve the simplest British humour, which will raise a smile whether readers are hunkering down at home or negotiating a desolate commute. Take one poem called ""The Beauty of Tea"":
Put the kettle on and make a cuppa,
It's the perfect lifter upper;
Do you risk it with your biscuits
And dunk them far too long?
Do you prefer your tea with sugar?
Do you like it weak or strong?
A nice brew can make things better
And can also quench your thirst,
Are you one of those
Who put the milk in first? *"

Anthony wood remembers sitting in the classroom one snowy morning as his teacher eyed the ""saucer-size flakes"" swirling outside the window. ""Please boys and girls"", she implored, ""pray that it stops snowing."" How little she grasped the mind of children, Mr Wood observes: ""We were praying, alright-praying that it would snow until June.""
Everyone knows children love snow. Mr Wood's new book is meant for adults who remain infatuated. It is less a systematic history than a meander through assorted snow-related subjects-beginning with the snowflake itself, which the author describes poetically as ""the dna of God"".
These miniature ice crystals were once neglected by scientists, who saw little practical benefit in studying them. Their disdain, however, was not shared by Wilson Bentley, a farm boy in Vermont who was given a microscope on his 15th birthday in 1880; later he acquired a bellows-camera, which he adapted to take the first-ever photomicrographs of snowflakes, being careful not to breathe on his evanescent subjects before tripping the shutter.
Inspired by Bentley's ethereal images, in 1936 Nakaya Ukichiro, a Japanese nuclear physicist, became the first person to manufacture snow in the lab. His research on how the crystals form showed that snowflakes develop on the fly, during their sometimes hours-long journey to the ground. The higher the humidity that they encounter on the way, the more intricate their architecture becomes.
Monster snowstorms interest Mr Wood, too, such as the great white hurricane of 1888, during which hundreds of people in the north-eastern United States died of hypothermia. Paralysing winter storms were disasters for cities like New York and Philadelphia, which initiated their own local ""arms race against nature"", experimenting with crude ploughs to clear streets and with substances from cinders to grape extract and salt to de-ice them. Snow also spurred the development of subway systems that burrowed beyond the reach of winter weather.
The atmospheric forces that created such blizzards remained unknown until Ooishi Wasaburo, another Japanese scientist, discovered chaotic eddies in the upper atmosphere, now known as the jet stream, in the 1920s. When the frigid jet stream bumps hard against humid air generated by the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, meteorological mayhem results. Given the complexity of the atmosphere-and the spotty nature of the available data on it-snow forecasting will always remain an inexact science, Mr Wood contends.
His scattershot chapters touch on the impact of erratic snowfall on the water crisis in California and on winter fun everywhere. He offers some frustratingly disjointed speculation about how climate change will alter future snowfalls. The short answer is that there will probably be more snow in places where humidity increases, and less where temperatures become too high to sustain it.
And he reflects, if briefly, on snow's delights and peculiar allure. Why do people either love it or hate it? Many long for it, Mr Wood proposes, because of the splendid isolation that it enforces. As with the pandemic, a white-out can be overwhelming. It can also direct attention inward, and help people return to themselves. *"

Given how much the world has changed in 2020, it is hard to fathom that the year was just one leap-day longer than 2019. On January 16th The Economist published its first article about a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, which at that point had been confirmed only as the cause of 42 infections and one death. Two weeks later, covid-19 made its debut on our cover. It returned there on February 27th, and held the slot for ten consecutive issues. The topic has claimed seven more covers since then.
Is the pandemic the biggest news story ever? The two world wars and the Spanish flu of 1918 caused far more deaths, as have various famines and genocides. However, covid-19 has altered people's daily routines in almost every country, in a way that deadlier events did not. Moreover, fatality counts cannot quantify developments that have changed people's lives for the better.
As an alternative measure, we combed through every article we have published since our founding in 1843, and counted how often we mentioned certain keywords in each year. To diversify this analysis, the New York Times has also granted us access to its archives, which stretch back to 1851. In both publications, just under half of articles this year (including January and February, when the disease was mostly limited to China) have included ""covid-19 or ""coronavirus. In late March, four-fifths of our own stories used one of those words.
Only two events in modern history have come close to these fractions: the world wars. The share of Economist stories referring to ""war reached 53% in 1915 and 54% in 1941. For the New York Times, it peaked at 39% in 1918 and 37% in 1942. This gap may be explained by America's distance from the battlefronts, which reduced the effect of the fighting on daily life. If newspapers around the world hewed closer to 35% than 55% in their reporting of the wars, then covid-19 has probably set a new record.
Media coverage is a flawed gauge of importance. Many critics worry that journalists focus too much on bad news, which often arrives via unexpected catastrophes, and too little on improvements, which tend to accumulate more gradually. Nonetheless, The Economist's archive bears traces of life getting better-or at least, we have taken stock of slow-moving changes in welfare more frequently as time has gone on. Even before 2020, mentions of ""health were rising. ""Democracy, though under threat in many countries, grew in popularity in the late 1980s. Articles about ""poverty became more common after 2000, when the un listed its eradication as its first goal for the new millennium.
The 21st century also brought a surge in stories referring to the ""internet or being ""online. Before 2020, the biggest change in most people's daily lives in recent decades was probably the advent of the world wide web and smartphones. If the pandemic makes working from home realistic for many employees, it might have a similarly long-lasting effect. That would be a welcome silver lining to a long, gloomy year. *

The house in Gainsborough Gardens was tall and elegant in the red-brick Hampstead manner, with a background of old trees. In front of the houses stretched a dank lawn strewn with leaves. He walked across it quickly to the locked gate on the Well Walk side, which preserved the hidden feel of the place. He might have been going to lunch at the Wells, where the rhubarb crumble was reliably good. But too many people knew John le Carré there, spotted his upright stance and far-sighted gaze, the fine greying head, and might start conversations. Today he had a different assignation. He turned not left but right, towards the Heath.
A weather-boarded barn stood by East Heath Road, with a bench on which it was said that Keats had sat and wept. On the other side of the road, a gravel track curved down through an avenue of trees. A few dog-walkers wandered on it. It was here, in ""Smiley's People"", the third part of his George Smiley trilogy, that General Vladimir had been shot in the face by Moscow agents. And there, just off the path, lodged in a crevice where a tree forked, Smiley had found the cigarette packet that held the proof he needed.
On the avenue his own pace slowed. Instinctively he began to practise tradecraft, or writing craft. He became observant, guarded, watchful, keeping to the edge of the path where the undergrowth slightly obscured him. Writers and spies shared the same ""corrosive eye"", as Graham Greene put it: that wish to penetrate the surface to the centre and truth of things.
In fact he had not been in ""the circus"" for long; just a few years, running low-grade agents into eastern Europe and then working out of the British embassy in Bonn, before Kim Philby, a celebrated double agent, exposed him. He was a writer who, very briefly, had been a spy. Yet he felt he had been recruited to the secret world from childhood, as Conrad was to the sea. He had acquired the comforting habit of cover-stories to try to account for a father who was in jail one moment and at Ascot the next: an epic conman from whom his mother bolted when he was five. He had joined the secret service for all kinds of romantic reasons, to do some good for society, and to discover how the world was really run; but also because he felt corporate attachment offered him a family's protection. To some extent it did. But he soon found with Alec Leamas, the pretend defector whom Smiley in ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" sent into East Germany and ultimately to his death, that spies were not priests or saints, but ""a squalid procession of vain fools...sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives"". In the cold war Western agents, aping Soviet ones, walked on the thinnest moral ice. It often broke.
At the end of the avenue lay a games field, with a goalpost askew and a few boys playing. Their bicycles were sprawled by the path. Across the field stood a small green tin pavilion, like a bus shelter. There Smiley had found, at head-height, the shiny mi6 drawing pin whose message was Proceed to the rendezvous, no danger sighted, together with Vladimir's chalked reply. Here, too, Smiley's shadow walked. A plump figure, balding, bespectacled and breathtakingly ordinary; keenly observant, wise, cunning, yet also shy, embarrassed by life, convinced that his clothes were wrong. He had emerged in 1961, in ""Call for the Dead"", a fully fledged combination of several people from the le Carré past; he took his bow in 2017, giving lectures in ""A Legacy of Spies"". And he had exposed his creator, through the books and films and especially the tv series of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", to the blaze of literary fame.
It was not wanted. ""John le Carré"" was a mask for a man, as much as a necessity for an author in the intelligence service. As a writer, like a spy, he needed to go incognito, sit at a back table, slip through doors, avoid the crowd. If he wanted he could unleash in a warm, military tone a fund of good stories, such as his near-seduction at 16, in front of her husband, by a countess at dinner in Panama, which drew him to the country later to set a novel of a crooked tailor. Storytelling was what he did. Now he was pumped for information which his vestigial loyalty to the service forbade him to speak of, as well as for solutions to mysteries that he knew nothing about. (""Who killed Robert Maxwell?"" Rupert Murdoch asked him, suddenly, when they lunched together.) And the public presumed he was at a loss when the cold war ended, with his great preoccupying subject gone.
On the contrary, its end delighted him. And history was far from over. The players changed, the game went on. He had focused on the cold war from the 1960s because it was the overriding drama of the age. Others quickly succeeded it: the arms trade (""The Night Manager""), the war on terror (""Absolute Friends""), Big Pharma's misdeeds in Africa (""The Constant Gardener""). Trump's America and Johnson's Britain, with their spoon-fed media and nationalistic duping of the public, appalled him equally. Each deserved excoriation in a book in which the characters acted out a global argument, just as the closed society of spies had been, for him, a theatre of the world.
So there could be no end to writing, and that, on this gradually clearing morning, was his purpose on the Heath. Notebooks weighed down his pockets; no laptop for him, but the unmechanised thrill of shaping the words with his pen. He had other scribbling places, particularly his seaside house at St Buryan in Cornwall, where no one knew who he was. North London was more difficult, as joggers panted past and trains rattled distantly on the Overground. He was making for a particular bench that stood separate from its companions, tucked under a spreading tree.
There he worked away. And it seemed to him from time to time, when he looked up, that a figure observed him. Balding, plump, quite unlike him physically, but with the same tendency to want to hide, and the same occasional sharp pain from seeing too much. Even at a distance he could spot him, from the way he thoughtfully cleaned his glasses with the fat end of his tie. A large part of himself, too, had gone to make up Smiley. He was now walking towards him, his lenses gleaming like mirrors. *"

The eu's member states back the pact, though the measures will come into force only provisionally until the European Parliament can give its blessing.
Scientists were worried by two new and more contagious variants of covid-19 that are spreading around the world. Nearly all the countries in the eu began vaccinating citizens, a week after the European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The Netherlands said it would not start until January 8th, claiming it wanted more time to implement its programme ""carefully"". Spain's health minister said a registry would be kept of people who refused to get vaccinated.

State investigators in Russia laid more dubious fraud charges against Alexei Navalny, the country's leading opposition politician. This came after Mr Navalny posted a tape of his phone call with an agent of the fsb security police, whom he tricked into admitting that the fsb had tried to poison him with a nerve agent in August. Vladimir Putin said that if the police had wanted to poison Mr Navalny, he would be dead.
In a u-turn, Donald Trump signed a $900bn stimulus bill into law. He had threatened to veto the legislation because, he said, the $600-per-person it provides in direct payments is not enough. Mr Trump wants payments of $2,000, which the House of Representatives duly noted and approved in a supplementary bill; the Senate will now consider the measure.
The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Walmart for an alleged lack of oversight in fulfilling prescriptions for opioids, which it says helped fuel the opioid crisis. In a strongly worded rebuttal, the retailer said the suit was riddled with factual mistakes and ""cherry-picked documents"" that were trying to shift blame away from the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Argentina became the first big Latin American country to legalise abortion, after a crucial vote in the Senate drew more support than had been expected. Women will now be able to get an abortion for any reason up to 14 weeks into a pregnancy.
A court in Shanghai sentenced Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, to four years in prison for ""picking quarrels and causing trouble"". She had reported on the outbreak of covid-19 in China in ways that embarrassed the Communist Party.

The transition is over and Britain is fully out of the European Union. On December 24th the sides agreed on a trade deal. It spares them the even greater upheaval of no deal at all (see Britain section). It is minimal, though, along the lines first signalled months ago. It largely overlooks services and marks the start of endless haggling. And, on British insistence, foreign policy and defence are ignored. Looking across the seas with an estranged continent at its back, a lonesome Britain thus faces a bracing question: what role should it now play in the world?
It is a question the country has grappled with off and on for centuries, and in recent decades British thinking has often been clouded by nostalgia for lost empire and great-power status. Membership of the European club provided an answer of sorts. Britain, as Tony Blair put it, could be a ""bridge"" between America and Europe, with influence in both Washington and Brussels. Now it must think afresh.
One possibility would be for Britons to accept their country's diminished status and focus on things at home-becoming a big Denmark, a decent north European place without great-power pretensions. Sure enough, in September 38% of Britons told Ipsos-mori's pollsters that Britain should ""stop pretending it is an important power in the world""; only 28% disagreed. Yet Britons should not take the benefits of influence for granted. It is to their advantage to try to sway the world in ways that suit British interests, whether on trade, climate change or democracy (including, like Denmark, through the power of example).
The Conservative government talks of ""Global Britain"", suggesting ambitions far beyond Europe. Yet more than four years after the referendum the idea is still little more than a slogan. Witness the lack of urgency over an ""Integrated Review"" of foreign policy, security, defence and development due to report in autumn 2020. It is now expected early in 2021.
That is a pity. As our Briefing explains, Global Britain has a lot going for it. Membership of nato, the G7, the G20, the Commonwealth, a permanent seat on the un Security Council-all bring influence. Britain has nuclear weapons and a capable army (after America, it expects to be the biggest defence spender in nato). It also has an abundance of soft power, for example through its hefty spending on foreign aid and through its able scientists, prominent in developing vaccines and identifying treatments for covid-19. In 2021 Britain is chairing the G7 and hosting the COP26 summit on climate change, both opportunities to shine.
Outside the eu, Britain can also be a nimbler power. It is able to move more boldly than the consensus-bound 27 member states on, say, sanctions on despotic Belarus, or more swiftly on approving a vaccine against covid-19. It has defied sceptics by rolling over trade deals with countries from Japan to Turkey. It can use its convening power for good causes, such as raising nearly $9bn for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. It can work with groups of like-minded countries to press interests-teaming up with Canada to promote media freedom and inviting Australia, India and South Korea to the G7 summit to underline democracy. Without the endless rounds of Euro-meetings, Britain's ministers and diplomats will have more time for action beyond Europe, including a ""tilt to the Indo-Pacific"", a region with growing importance for everything from trade to security.
However, if Global Britain is to live up to these aspirations Boris Johnson and his successors will have to face up to some daunting problems. Over time, Britain's sway in the world will depend on its success at home-much as the perceived prowess of Thatcherism and Blairism helped Britain ""punch above its weight"". That has just become harder, and not only because Britain's management of covid-19 has harmed its reputation. One reason is economic: Britain's recent performance has been poor and Brexit will be a further drag on growth. Another is political: dismay at Brexit is prompting renewed calls for Scottish independence and a united Ireland. Britain will not be taken seriously abroad if it is falling apart at home.
Britain also needs to develop the political culture to make hard choices and stand by them. These arise because it has to withstand the temptation of trying to do too much. It is easy to draw up a long to-do list, far trickier to decide what not to do.
The danger of overstretch is clear. Sending an aircraft-carrier to Asia may look like an impressive projection of power, but it makes little sense when the likely threats to Britain are closer to home. France does a better job of concentrating its diplomatic resources where it can have the most impact, such as the Sahel. The Foreign Office, newly merged with the Department for International Development, could reallocate some of its combined firepower to make sure it is better represented on the ground where it counts. The team for COP26, supposedly a priority, looks puny next to the heavyweight power France deployed in the run-up to the Paris agreement at COP21 or that the incoming Biden administration is already assembling.
Some signs suggest the government can make tough calls. An example is its painful recent decision to cut foreign aid from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. Another is the planned boost to defence spending, with a focus on strengthening areas-cyber-capabilities and naval power-with global relevance. On China, the argument between those who stress investment and those who prioritise security and Britain's relationship with America is going the way of the Sinosceptics, judging by a hardening rhetoric on defence, the decision to ban Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, from Britain's 5G networks, as well as a robust response to China's crackdown in Hong Kong. That makes sense, too.
That Europe question-again
The glaring gap is Europe. Theresa May, a former prime minister, wanted an ""ambitious partnership"" with the eu on foreign and security policy. Mr Johnson prefers to work ad hoc through nato, bilateral ties and the ""E3"" with France and Germany-all very well, but limited. History suggests that Britain will eventually be pulled back towards Europe. Shared interests and the need to pool resources argue for a partnership. Strange as it may seem to Brexiteers, the sooner the ex-EU member gets over its blindness over Europe, the better the prospects for Global Britain. *"

Every country wants to build more bridges, roads and renewable-power grids. It won't be easy
In 1916 cincinnati decided to construct a magnificent new subway system. After decades of cock-ups it was abandoned in 1948, and today there are two miles of tunnels beneath the city that have never been used. That cautionary tale is still relevant. Politicians everywhere are calling for more infrastructure spending (see Finance section). Yet few industries have a worse record of coming through on time and on budget. If the incipient boom is to produce better results, governments and firms must learn to adopt best practice from around the world.
Most countries have enacted short-term stimulus plans to deal with the pandemic. On December 27th President Donald Trump signed a $900bn spending bill (see United States section). But there is also appetite to binge on infrastructure. Joe Biden wants to spend $2trn on roads, power grids and railways, and hopes to win bipartisan support for his plans. The European Union has just approved a €1.8trn ($2.2trn) budget, a slug of which is for digital and energy investments.
The new infrastructure infatuation is understandable. Public and private investment has stagnated at 3-4% of gdp worldwide. That is too little to maintain ageing assets in developed countries-a third of American bridges are creaky-or to provide enough clean water and electricity in the emerging world. Low interest rates mean financing is cheap, and many economists think that the payback from infrastructure is attractive. Meanwhile, climate change and the digitisation of the economy are creating vast demand for renewable-energy systems and connectivity, including 5G networks.
In practice, however, infrastructure's record is as potholed as a Mumbai motorway. Cost-overruns often exceed 25%. Twothirds of foreign bribery cases involve infrastructure deals. China spends more than anyone else, but perhaps half of its investments have destroyed economic value. India had a boom in the 2000s which ended in a mire of debt. Even Germany struggles to get it right. All this reflects some deep underlying problems. Most projects have a time horizon beyond that of politicians and voters. Often they are one of a kind: China has just Three Gorges to dam, not six. And the full economic benefits created by a road, say, are not captured by the organisation paying for it.
Yet bitter experience does at least suggest two universal lessons. First, governments should select projects systematically by creating a single list and picking those with the highest payback. This assessment should factor in externalities, including the impact on carbon emissions, and delays, which are a big source of cost overruns. And it should be carried out by bodies that are independent from those that build and run assets. Often the projects selected will not be the glittering new temples that politicians like their names on, but humble repairs and maintenance.
The second lesson is to harness the private sector. Not only is it a source of capital-global infrastructure funds have over $200bn waiting to be deployed-but projects with private investors also tend to be managed better. That means developing standardised contracts and independent regulators that protect taxpayers but also give investors reasonable certainty of an adequate return.
Both lessons might seem obvious. A few places, such as Chile and Norway, get infrastructure right. But over half of the countries surveyed by the imf do not maintain a national pipeline of projects. And in most the record is staggeringly erratic. America is splurging on 5G (see Business section) but has squalid airports and too little renewable energy. Europe has shiny airports and wind farms but is in the stone age on 5G. Infrastructure is one of the last local industries left where easy gains are still to be had by copying others around the world. If you benchmark public investment in over 100 countries, adopting best practice could make spending 33% more efficient. The prize is huge. Just don't expect a subway in Cincinnati. *"

Mutations are making the c ud-19 virus more infectious
The winter solstice may have passed, but in the land of covid-19 the nights are still growing longer. In recent weeks two variants of the coronavirus have spread with ferocious speed in Britain and South Africa. They have mutations that make them a lot more contagious. Although, so far, they do not seem to be any deadlier, for every ten people that older variants would infect in Britain the new one infects 15. Early data suggest that the South African variant burns just as fiercely.
Just now the world is rightly focused on approving, making and administering vaccines. Alas, it also needs to face up to the fact that before jabs come to the rescue, the new variants will spread, creating deep difficulties for policymakers.
Evolutionary biologists have shrugged at the appearance of the mutations: this is how viruses behave, for natural selection favours variants that are more transmissible and less deadly (see Science section). Some viruses that cause common colds may have started out as vicious as sars-cov-2 and moderated in their old age. Policymakers cannot afford to be so relaxed. A more transmissible covid-19 virus that is just as dangerous, as this variant is, means that hospitals may be overwhelmed. In England the majority of the population has been in near-full lockdown for weeks. Yet covid-19 patients at hospitals have now exceeded the peak in April and the health service is struggling to cope.
Much of the rest of the world, including Europe and America, will soon follow. More than 50 countries rushed to ban travellers from Britain as soon as its scientists told the world about the new variant, in mid-December. Many have also banned arrivals from South Africa. But such measures are likely to buy only a little time. In early November, before travel bans, the British variant already accounted for nearly 30% of cases in London, one of the world's most connected cities. Given how early variants spread from ski resorts in the Alps last winter and from Spain in the summer, it is naive to believe that cases are not already seeded all over Europe and beyond. Once it arrives, the new British variant is likely to displace local strains within a few weeks.
So far, only sporadic cases of it have been found in 20 or so countries, including in America in a man who had not travelled. But that is because, unlike Britain and South Africa, most do little genomic sequencing to look for mutations. France has examined the virus fewer times in the entire pandemic than Wales does in a week. Most countries do not look at all. Other more contagious variants may thus be spreading undetected.
The good news is that these mutations are unlikely to reinfect people who have had the disease or to evade today's covid-19 vaccines. Natural selection will, eventually, begin to change that, as more and more people are inoculated, but vaccines can be tweaked to remain effective. With the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the process takes just six weeks.
Between now and then
However, even in the mostly rich countries that have hoarded vaccine supplies there will not be enough to stop the virus from spreading, at least until summer. This week's emergency approval of the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab will help (see Britain section), but there will still be delays. Poorer and middle-income countries will remain less well protected for a lot longer.
Countries in Europe and beyond will be forced to deal with this fast-changing reality by reassessing the trade-offs between the benefits from the harsh lockdowns needed to stop a more contagious virus and their long-term costs to schooling, health and livelihoods. There is still light at the end of the tunnel. But the road through it has become a lot more treacherous. *"

Few reforms would benefit Japan as much as putting government services online
It is a ritual almost as frequent and as fleeting as observing the cherry blossoms each year. A new Japanese government pledges to move more public services online. Almost as soon as the promise is made, it falls to the ground like a sad pink petal. In 2001 the government announced it would digitise all its procedures by 2003-yet almost 20 years later, just 7.5% of all administrative procedures can be completed online (see Asia section). Only 7.3% ofJapanese applied for any sort of government service online, well behind not only South Korea and Iceland, but also Mexico and Slovakia. Japan is an e-government failure.
That is a great pity, and not just for hapless Japanese citizens wandering from window to window in bewildering government offices. Japan's population is shrinking and ageing. With its workforce atrophying, Japan relies even more than other economies on gains in productivity to maintain prosperity. The Daiwa Institute of Research, a think-tank in Tokyo, reckons that putting government online could permanently boost gdp per person by 1%. The failure to do so is a missed opportunity.
The lapse is all the more remarkable given Japan's wealth and technological sophistication. Indeed, that seems to be part of the problem. Over the years big local technology firms have vied for plum contracts to develop it systems for different, fiercely autonomous, government departments. Most ended up designing bespoke software for each job. The result is a profusion of incompatible systems.
Happily, the government of Suga Yoshihide, who became prime minister in September 2020, seems to be making more than the typical ritual stab at resolving the problem. It is creating a new government agency intended to drag the old ones into the digital world. This new office will be in charge of procurement of it systems for the government as a whole, giving it real clout. It will be headed by a tech executive, not a bureaucrat.
As a laggard in the rich world in the adoption of digital public services, Japan does at least have the advantage of being able to learn from the experience of other countries. It could look to Estonia for advice on imposing data standards across government departments. Estonia also operates a model digital-iD system (Japan's is used by less than 20% of the population, and the pandemic has highlighted its shortcomings). It could follow South Korea's example in making more of its public data, processes and services ""open by default"", and being transparent about its use of data when devising policies and designing services. And to boost take-up it could learn from Denmark, where applications for 95% of state pensions and 100% of maternity benefits are now handled digitally.
These successes were achieved in part by pressing ahead despite the predictable misgivings of hidebound bureaucrats and technonervous pensioners. Japan has tended in the past to placate such people by building parallel digital systems and making use of them voluntary. It will have to get tougher with its citizens and civil servants as well as its it contractors if take-up of digital services is to increase. In fact, officials may find that if they make digital government work more smoothly, much of the resistance to it melts away, as the advantages and cost savings arising from doing paperwork online become more obvious.
The potential gains in productivity, if Japan's administrators get their act together, would be enormous. The older the population becomes, the greater the benefit, to them and to the government, of doing away with queues and forms. The savings of time, money and effort will only grow. And unlike the transient beauty of the cherry blossom, the blessings of more efficient government would be lasting. *"

Retailers everywhere should look to China
Over the past ten months most people in the rich world have participated in the biggest shopping revolution in the West since malls and supermarkets conquered suburbia 50 years ago. The pandemic has led to a surge in online spending, speeding up the shift from physical stores by half a decade or so. Forget the chimney; Christmas gifts in 2020 came flying through the letterbox or were dumped on the doorstep. Workers at a handful of firms, including Amazon and Walmart, have made superhuman efforts to fulfil online orders, and their investors have made supernormal profits as Wall Street has bid up their shares on euphoria that Western retailing is at the cutting edge.
Yet as we explain this week (see Business section) it is in China, not the West, where the future of e-commerce is being staked out. Its market is far bigger and more creative, with tech firms blending e-commerce, social media and razzmatazz to become online-shopping emporia for 850m digital consumers. And China is also at the frontier of regulation, with the news on December 24th that trustbusters were investigating Alibaba, co-founded by Jack Ma, China's most celebrated tycoon, and until a few weeks ago its most valuable listed firm. For a century the world's consumer businesses have looked to America to spot new trends, from scannable barcodes on Wrigley's gum in the 1970s to keeping up with the Kardashians' consumption habits in the 2010s. Now they should be looking to the East.
China's lead in e-commerce is not entirely new. By size, its market overtook America's in 2013-with little physical store space, its consumers and retailers leapfrogged ahead to the digital world. When Alibaba listed in 2014 it was the world's largest-ever initial public offering. Today the country's e-retailing market is worth $2trn, more than America's and Europe's combined. But beyond its sheer size it now stands out from the past, and from the industry in the West, in several crucial ways.
For a start it is more dynamic. In the past few years new competitors, including Meituan and Pinduoduo, have come of age with effervescent business models. One sign of fierce competition is that Alibaba's share of the market capitalisation of the Chinese e-commerce industry has dropped from 81% when it listed to 55% today. Competition has also led e-commerce and other tech firms to demolish the boundaries between different types of services that are still common in the West. Point and click are passé: online-shopping platforms in China now blend digital payments, group deals, social media, gaming, instant messaging, short-form videos and live-streaming celebrities.
The obvious, multi-trillion-dollar question is whether the Chinese model of e-commerce will go global. As has been the case for decades, Silicon Valley's giants still tend to underestimate China. There are few direct links between the American and Chinese e-commerce industries, partly owing to protectionism on both sides (Yahoo sold much of its stake in Alibaba, far too early, in 2012). And Western firms have long been organised in cosy, predictable silos. So Visa specialises in payments, Amazon in e-commerce, Facebook in social media, Google in search, and so on. The main source of uncertainty in e-commerce has been just how many big traditional retailers will go bust-over 30 folded in America in 2020-and whether a few might manage the shift online, as Walmart and Target have.
Yet however safe and siloed Western e-retailing may appear to be, it is now unlikely that it will become the world's dominant mode of shopping. Already, outside rich countries, the Chinese approach is gaining steam. Many leading e-commerce firms in South-East Asia (Grab and Sea), India (Jio), and Latin America (Mercado Libre) are influenced by the Chinese strategy of offering a ""super-app"" with a cornucopia of services from noodle delivery to financial services. The giant consumer-goods firms that straddle the Western and Chinese markets may transmit Chinese ideas and business tactics, too. Multinationals such as Unilever, L'Oréal and Adidas make more revenue in Asia than in America and their bosses turn to there, not to California or Paris, to see the latest in digital marketing, branding and logistics.
Already, Chinese characteristics are emerging in the retail heartlands of the West, partly as a result of the pandemic. The silos are breaking down as firms diversify. Facebook is now promoting shopping services on its social networks, and engaging in ""social commerce"", including in live-streaming and the use of WhatsApp, for messaging between merchants and shoppers. In December Walmart hosted its first live shopping event within TikTok, a Chinese-owned video app in which it hopes to buy a stake. In France in the past quarter the sixth-most-downloaded e-commerce app was Vova, linked to Pinduoduo's founder. And new entrants may finally make progress in America-the share price of Shopify, a platform for Amazon exiles and small firms, has soared so that it is now valued at more than $i40bn.
This shift to a more Chinese-style global industry promises to be excellent news for consumers. Prices would be lower, as China has seen fierce discounting by competing firms. Choice and innovation would probably grow. Even so, Chinese e-commerce has flaws. In a Wild West climate, fraud is more common. And there are those antitrust concerns. It is tempting to see the crackdown on Mr Ma as just another display of brutal Communist Party power (see Free exchange). It may partly be that, but China's antitrust regulators are also keen to boost competition. That means enforcing interoperability, so that, for example, payments services on one e-commerce platform can be used seamlessly on a rival one. And it means preventing e-commerce firms from penalising merchants who sell goods in more than one place online. So far American and European trustbusters have been ineffectual at controlling big tech, despite a flurry of lawsuits and draft laws at the end of 2020. They, too, should study China, for a sense of where the industry is heading and how to respond.
There is a pattern to how the West thinks about Chinese innovation. From electronics to solar panels, Chinese manufacturing advances were either ignored or dismissed as copying, then downplayed and then grudgingly acknowledged around the world. Now it is the Chinese consumer's tastes and habits that are going global. Watch and learn. *"

Bartleby summarised a new book by David Bodanis on fairness in business (December 12th). The column narrated the story of Eastern Airlines by describing it as a corporation built by Eddie Rickenbacker, ""who had granted mechanics a 40-hour week, profit-related pay and a pension"", but ""when Frank Lorenzo took over the company in the 1980s, he cut wages, alienated the staff and pursued a policy of assetstripping the company. The workers went on strike in protest and Eastern went bankrupt.""
However, Rickenbacker operated during a lush golden era of air travel. The government regulated air fares, and kept them high. Competition was genteel. Then along came the Deregulation Act of 1978, a sea change in the airline industry. New discount airlines sprouted up and airlines added flights to Eastern's touristoriented routes to Florida. Ticket prices plummeted. Yet the unions refused to recog-nise these new financial realities. By 1986 Eastern Airlines was on the brink of bankruptcy. That's when Frank Borman, a former astronaut and Eastern's chief executive, asked me about a sale to my airline group. He told me he'd decided to sell to us because ""the unions wouldn't make the necessary changes."" When we took over, we thought the unions would understand that change had to come, but they continued to fight. In 1989, needing cash to continue operations, we sold the Eastern Shuttle to Donald Trump for $365m. That reality didn't soften union intransigence; they fought on, so the airline sadly ended up being liquidated with tens of thousands of jobs lost.
Fairness is certainly a worthy subject of a business book. But Mr Bodanis has misunderstood our Eastern acquisition. It might have been better if he had mentioned our take on fairness. Our group was the first to eliminate cigar and pipe smoking, the first airline to provide stock incentive programmes to employees, and so on.

Sizing households
It is not true that people in the western world only started to live in nuclear families after industrialisation (""Nuclear retreat"", December 5th). That is a popular historical myth. In western Europe, the average household size was fairly small long before the Industrial Revolution, below five people since the 16th century, if not earlier. In England rural families tended to be nuclear or only slightly extended. They certainly were not the big groups to which your article alludes. In Bulgaria, a country I studied in detail, the average household size was larger in the 1980s than in the 19th century, for the simple reason that the communist regime could not provide enough housing. Bulgarian peasants in the 19th century lived on small, individual farms, which were divided up once their sons married.

A role for coal
After almost 18 months as chief executive of the World Coal Association, it does not surprise me to see negative headlines dismissing coal (""Make coal history"", December 5th). I was alerted to your story as I was giving a speech to the Indian government and industrialist stakeholders at a forum which reinforced that coal will continue to be significant in India's energy mix; we discussed the preparations that will need to happen for its responsible usage. Similar themes were heard at meetings with ministers in South-East Asia. In fact, these sort of headlines are often disregarded by the coal-growth regions because dismissing coal is dismissing the right of developing and emerging economies to choose their own energy source to support development.
There is not one government minister or adviser in the key coal markets whom I have spoken to who wants to make the same mistakes as developed economies. Equally, they do not wish to promote an uneconomical and unsustainable vision that is not realistic. That is why so many countries continue to use coal, which is still forecast to be the single biggest source of electricity in 2040. Since 2010, 40 countries that have not used coal for power in the past have added coal to their energy portfolios.
Although The Economist was dismissive of the role that can be played by clean-coal technologies, the emissions reduction potential is significant. Many countries have included a role for coal and clean-coal technologies in their Paris agreement pledges. Globally, the average efficiency of coalfuelled power plants is 37.5%. If this was raised to 47.5%, which is possible with today's technology, this would reduce global emissions by two gigatonnes, equivalent to eliminating the asean region's 2017 carbon emissions from all fossil fuels. Carbon capture, use and storage is also vital to our climate efforts.

Until recently, Chile produced around 40% of its electricity from burning coal. But the country is now a star in energy transition because of new renewables like wind and solar. We are committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. The guiding principles for this change have been the openness of our economy to foreign investment, free trade, intense competition in our generation market, sound public policy and a long-term commitment to sustainable economic growth. There are no public subsidies for renewables, but we are endowed with lots of sunshine in Atacama, winds from the Pacific and water from the Andes.
We hope that the share of renewables in electricity will rise from 45% to above 85% by 2030. The climate emergency gives us little time. The scope and speed needed for this energy transformation is enormous. Chile's path of a private-sector market-based approach to energy transition is an example for other countries to follow in order to make coal history.

Enough to drive you mad
Repairing potholes does not necessarily bring unalloyed joy to Britain's motorists (""Revolutionary roads"", November 28th). Roadworks are announced with the least welcome phrase in the English language: ""Three-Way Traffic Control"". Temporary traffic lights are equipped with cameras and technology capable of issuing fines with relentless efficiency to any driver foolish enough to disobey them. The repairs cause even more congestion. The Kafkaesque inefficiency of remedial work is painful enough. However, policing it with great precision and careful logistics suggests a muddling of priorities.

""Got a feeling '21 is going to be a good vJyear,"" the stepfather in ""Tommy"", a rock opera by The Who, tells his family. The British government is trying to give a similar impression of optimism. After its year of post-Brexit transition, and with a lastminute trade deal that staves off some of the worst effects of leaving the European Union, the new year offers the country a number of opportunities to cut a dash on the world stage. It will take the presidency of the Gy club of big rich democracies, allowing it not just to set the agenda for the group's annual summit, but also to invite Australia, India and South Korea to come along-an invitation that might be the groundwork for a ""dio"" of democracies. In November the most important diplomatic event of the year, the COP26 climate conference, will open in Glasgow.
Within weeks Boris Johnson, Britain's prime minister, will be visiting India, where on January 26th he will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi's guest of honour for Republic Day. His visit will be part of a much-touted ""tilt to the Indo-Pacific"". Britain has opened discussions on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a freetrade area of 11 countries. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is pushing for it also to become a ""dialogue partner"" of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The Royal Navy's flagship, the spanking new aircraft-carrier hms Queen Elizabeth, will soon be Asia bound.
Freed from an endless round of eu gatherings, British diplomats expect to have more time for globe trotting. Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister, has pointed out that there was a period of 17 years when no British foreign secretary visited Australia; such slights are unlikely to be repeated. Over the year since Brexit various nimble moves-from offering people in Hong Kong a path to British citizenship after China's crackdown there, to sanctions on Belarus while the rest of Europe dithered, to rapid approval for a covid vaccine-have shown that Britain can stand out. ""It's exciting to see the British government making creative choices in its national security,"" says Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, an American think-tank. ""That's a really important way to signal that Britain outside of the eu sees itself as a leader in national security and is willing to take the risks and the consequences of leading with its values.""
For all these tokens of real potential, though, there are serious impediments to the creation, or recreation, of a ""Global Britain""-a project with which many of those who brought about Brexit are enamoured. Through leaving the eu the country weakened its economic prospects; since then covid has hit it hard. The economy has longer-term problems, too. Since 2005 British firms' share of world market capitalisation has fallen from over 7% to 3%, a much greater slippage than any other large European economy. Over the same period the share of the stock of global cross-border investment attributable to Britishheadquartered multinationals has fallen from 10% to 6%, also a bigger drop than for any other major economy.
At the same time the world is returning to an era of great-power competition: deepening rivalry between America and China, Russia's brazen opportunism, the Eu's stubborn assertiveness, at least in eco- nomic policy. ""The next chapter of world affairs will be about the political, economic, regulatory, technological and military interplay between the us, China and Europe,"" says Sir Simon Fraser, one of Britain's former top diplomats. ""The task for the uk is finding our place in this.""
To do so will require a clear strategic vision and coherent implementation. Yet these are just the things which, according to a recent report by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, British foreign policy currently lacks. Unless Britain applies itself to acquiring those necessities, good years will prove hard to find.
No reason to be over-optimistic
It is easy to dismiss Britain's strengths, and many of its inhabitants delight in doing so. But though Britain is no longer the leading power it was in the first half of the 20th century (see chart) it is still a manifestly significant one. It has the world's fifth-largest economy, according to the imf, and is one of the five nuclear-armed states with a permanent seat on the un Security Council. It is a muscular member of nato and its signals-intelligence service, gchq, makes it a potent part of the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing elite, together with America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Its imperial past has left it one of the few countries to have a number of overseas territories, which extend its presence while also adding to its obligations. Its head of state is the head of state of 15 other countries, too, as well as leader of the 54-nation Commonwealth. The Anglican Communion is the world's third-largest Christian church. Britain is rare among rich countries in spending a hefty chunk of its national income on foreign aid and doing so well. It is the biggest voluntary contributor to the World Health Organisation and to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance.
Britain has a high profile in sport, thanks in large part to the Premier League's global following among football fans, and is one of the most popular destinations for international tourists. It has the world's most respected public broadcaster, the bbc, and some of its best universities. Though the British government, like many others, botched its response to covid-19, its scientists have excelled themselves, as they do in many fields. They have helped to develop what may prove to be the most widely used vaccine (the one from OxfordAstraZeneca) and to identify the most effective treatment for those who get ill (the steroid dexamethasone).
But none of these advantages is new. Britain enjoyed them all when it was a member of the EU-while also benefiting from being part of the world's largest trading bloc and its most important grouping of democracies. To have any chance of getting more out of its native strengths now than it did then, it will need a foreign policy which understands both how to build on them and what that requires. Rory Stewart, who resigned from his ministerial post running the Department for International Development (DfiD) when Mr Johnson became prime minister in 2019, says that the self-examination needed has so far been lacking. ""We do these things, but we have no very settled, confident idea about why we're doing these things.""
The delayed but now imminent report of the government's ""Integrated Review"" of foreign policy, security, defence and international development should provide some of the foundations required; it has been billed by Mr Johnson as the biggest rethink of Britain's international stance since the end of the cold war. But several key decisions on the direction of policy have already been taken. In June 2020 Mr Johnson (himself a former foreign secretary, if not a terribly good one) announced that DfiD would henceforth be subsumed into the Foreign Office.
In theory, that will make British policy more co-ordinated, combining the diplomats' lobbying power with DfiD's technical expertise. It may also go some way to reversing the decline of Britain's diplomatic representation around the world. In the 1990s, says Mr Stewart, Britain had perhaps 25 diplomats in Zambia. Over the decades that dwindled to an ambassador, one other diplomat and local employees. Bringing in DfiD may make representation more beefy. But many fear that any such benefits will come at the expense of lasting damage to the capabilities that made Britain an ""aid superpower"". ""It's not a merger, it's the demolition of Df id,"" Andrew Mitchell, another former head of the department, has lamented. In November new legislation reduced foreign-aid spending from 0.7% of GDP-an established benchmark-to 0.5%.
Military spending has fared better. It is set to rise by £6.5bn more than previously planned over the next four years, reversing a decade of cuts and confirming Britain's status as the leading military spender among European members of nato, with an annual budget of some £47bn. The pattern of spending leans heavily towards the maritime; there is also spending on technology, with the creation of an agency for artificial intelligence and a new emphasis on mounting attacks in cyberspace.
Freedom tastes of reality
Defence spending up, aid outlays down, the Foreign Office and development departments merged: the resources and institutions with which Britain's new strategy will be implemented seem set. The strategy which informs these choices, though, has yet to be clearly enunciated.
The government will want to remain as close as possible to America. Marta Dassu, a foreign-policy expert at the Aspen Institute Italia in Rome, sees the increased investment in security as ""a sort of downpayment to the us, to show the incoming American administration that the uk is still very relevant"". The government will take heart from the idea that the administration led by Joe Biden, the presidentelect, will emphasise allies rather than ""America First"". Yet the degree to which Donald Trump's dramatic turn away from global leadership was accepted by the American people will not be forgotten. Nor is Mr Biden likely to favour aggressive interven- tions like those which Britain has been willing to back in the past.
What of the world's other major powers? There was a time when Britain's Conservatives saw Chinese investment as playing a big part in Britain's economic future and went out of their way to court it. The authoritarianism of President Xi Jinping, the clampdown on Hong Kong and a toughened American stance-one that Mr Biden will not reverse-have forced a rethink. British policy towards Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant, diverged from America's for some time; but in 2020 the company was barred from involvement in Britain's SG plans. There are still some in Mr Johnson's party who want to see a deeper relationship with China. But the Sinosceptics seem to have the upper hand.
And then there is Europe. Britain is keen on its continuing ""E3"" security discussions with France and Germany (despite covid-19, the troika met five times in 2020 to discuss Iran and other matters). But it insisted that foreign policy, external security and defence co-operation be excluded from the negotiations which led to the deal reached on December 24th. Britain ""can't actually tackle Europe in an entirely rational way at the moment,"" says François Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research, a French think-tank. ""Although it's an integrated review, it's integrating everything except Europe.""
Mr Johnson's government has avoided almost any mention of the eu in its foreign-policy discussions; but relations with the rest of Europe will play a crucial role in the success of any such policy, both directly and indirectly. Directly because Britain is still, physically and militarily, part of Europe. The adventurism of Russia under Vladimir Putin means that global Britain's military commitments will remain concentrated in its own European region, handled through nato and in concert with its former eu partners.
What is more, many of Britain's global goals will be shared by the eu, and best pursued in partnership. Sometimes, though, the two parties' goals will clash. Ms Dassu warns that Britain will find itself competing with the eu in its relationship with the Biden administration, which ""will look to Germans first and the uk second.""
The deepest influence may well be the effect that leaving the eu will have on Britons themselves. If the divorce with the eu leads to ever greater internal tensions, Britain will remain hopelessly distracted and potentially diminished. A particular worry in strategic circles is that, were such divisions to extend as far as independence for Scotland, the future of the British nuclear-armed submarine force, which is based there, would be in doubt. Though independence will not easily be won under a British government which will not grant the people of Scotland the necessary referendum, it is not the unthinkable outcome it once was. Even without such a rupture, according to Sophia Gaston of the British Foreign Policy Group, a think-tank, Brexit has produced, or revealed, ""an enormous amount of volatility"" in public attitudes to foreign policy.
All alone, cousin
The prime minister, whose hero is Winston Churchill, frequently claims Britain to be ""world-beating"". A nostalgic devotion to such ideas is likely to be evident in the Integrated Review. Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, expects it to exhibit a tension ""between the sort of exceptionalism that seems to be very much the leitmotif of the whole Brexit saga, and the reality that Britain will only make a difference in the world in partnership with other friends and allies."" Karin von Hippel of rusi, a British think-tank that specialises in military affairs, warns that the review risks resembling ""a Christmas tree"" with ""a bit of everything"" hanging off it. Britain could find itself overstretching and underachieving in a number of areas.
Take the tilt to the Indo-Pacific. Sceptics question how central this is to British policy, and what the country can hope to achieve. They view the idea of Britain as anything other than a secondary player in Asian security as ""fanciful"". There also appears to be little public enthusiasm for it. ""The British people don't fundamentally buy into the argument of us having a specific role in the Indo-Pacific region at the moment,"" says Ms Gaston. And spending on a military presence well beyond Europe and the Atlantic may prove hard to justify. ""I'm a great fan of the British military, but much of it is symbolic,"" says Mr Stewart. ""They're going to end up with maybe 25 fighting vessels, at incredible expense. Are we actually going to go to war with China to stop them from taking Taiwan?""
In general, Britain has not looked like a very effective power over the past few years. Observers overseas have not just puzzled over its willingness to inflict harm on itself by leaving the eu. They have also marvelled at its lack of a plan for doing so and the years of political chaos that ensued. Britain's credibility as a champion of the rules-based international order plummeted when its government showed itself to be willing to break part of the withdrawal agreement it had just signed with the eu. And Mr Johnson's handling of the pandemic has hardly inspired faith in British pragmatism and competence.
That recent experience leads to doubts about whether the government is deploying sufficient resources on the projects that it most needs to succeed. Lord Ricketts, who was ambassador to France in the run-up to COP21, which produced the Paris agreement on climate change, worries that COP26 may be an example. He recalls that France's foreign minister at the time, Laurent Fabius, ""spent a year travelling the world and putting it together, and we've got a part-time Alok Sharma [the business secretary] as our special envoy for climate change."" He suggests Britain is ""underweight"" in preparing for it.
The common thread in all these doubts is whether Britain is fundamentally serious in what its leaders talk of achieving. Can it prioritise a few areas and devote sufficient attention and resources to make a real difference? And can it find a way to develop a proper policy towards Europe? Until it does so, the suspicion will remain that there is too much symbolism and too little substance in its thinking on foreign policy. Britain's accumulated assets in the game of nations will not make up for a failure to take that game seriously."

The uk-eu trade agreement means more red tape and an eternity of negotiations
The trade deal that Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, struck on December 24th is better than no deal. That is about the best that can be said for it. It does not cover all of Britain's trade, nor does it provide stability. An eternity of negotiations lies ahead. Britain's relationship with the eu will look rather like that of Switzerland, which has spent years battling over details.
Last-minute concessions on both sides got the deal done. Even a week earlier, many diplomats doubted it would happen. But Mr Johnson then gave ground on fisheries, and Mrs von der Leyen backed off a demand for instant retaliation if Britain diverged unfairly from the so-called level playing field for eu labour, environmental and state-aid standards. Businesses on both sides are relieved, although doing a deal barely a week before the standstill transition period ends on December 31st is likely to maximise short-term disruption.
For goods trade, the deal means no tariffs and no quotas, a broader agreement than Canada's. Carmakers and the agrifood industry are reasonably happy, though the fishing lobby was disappointed with taking back only 25% of the eu's catch in British waters until June 30th 2026. But Mr Johnson is wrong to claim that there will be no new non-tariff barriers. Leaving the single market and customs union necessitates border, customs, rules-of-origin and veterinary checks that will raise the cost of trading, even if the rules are lightly enforced at first. And the level playing field, albeit now subject to independent arbitration, means that if Britain diverges much from eu standards, tariffs may be reimposed.
The biggest gap is services, some 80% of Britain's economy and nearly half its exports. The eu sees the free movement of people as integral to trade in services, so Britain was bound to lose unfettered access to that market. Brexiteers argue that since there is no eu single market in services, that is no great loss. It is certainly incomplete; but being cut out of it will still hurt. Professionals may find it harder to work in Europe, for their qualifications will no longer automatically be recognised. Audio-visual services, a business in which Britain leads Europe, are excluded from the deal. Digital and e-commerce providers will face new barriers. It has yet to be decided whether rulings in Britain's civil courts will be valid in the eu; if not, lawyers may lose lucrative business.
Nowhere is the deal thinner than in financial services, the source of Britain's greatest comparative advantage. Early hopes of keeping ""passporting"" rights that allow British-based financiers full access to eu customers evaporated with the decision to quit the single market. The Bank of England also insisted on keeping regulatory autonomy over financial services. The eu has granted equivalence for British regulatory standards only temporarily and in specific areas, such as derivatives clearing, that it sees as crucial to its own financial stability. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, promises to negotiate a broader deal, but the eu is clear that equivalence is a unilateral decision that can be revoked at 30 days' notice. Many eu countries hope to pinch financial business from London; there is no reason to expect them to be seized by a sudden fit of generosity to a rival.
There is a similar concern over the handling of data. It had been hoped that the eu would take an early decision to approve the adequacy of British data protection, but it has not yet done so. Purists on the conti- nent are anyway dubious about Anglo-Saxon commitment to data privacy. The eu has in the past criticised British and American protection of personal data. British access to eu security and police databases will also be somewhat curtailed in future, making a nonsense of claims by Priti Patel, the home secretary, that the new deal somehow makes Britons ""safer"".
On financial services, data and much else the Brexit negotiations are by no means over. It is not just that there are loose ends in the deal to tie up. The agreement also sets up a raft of over 25 specialist committees, ministerial councils and working groups in areas ranging from organic products to sanitary and phytosanitary measures, from aviation safety to public procurement. And it provides for both sides to review the deal's implementation every five years, which may be interesting after the next British election.
Further liberalisation of trade in services will equally be a matter of apparently endless negotiation. As David Henig, a trade expert, notes this week in a paper for Best for Britain, a lobby group, new restrictions on visas for eu citizens will make life harder for many services businesses that are heavily dependent on the ability of individuals to move around freely. He adds that, if it is to make further progress with global liberalisation of trade in services, which has largely stalled, Britain will first have to work more closely with the eu, by far its biggest market.
This is the lesson from Switzerland, which rejected eu membership in the early 1990s largely because of concerns about sovereignty that echo those of most Brexiteers. The Swiss have since spent years negotiating two complex packages of measures to give them broad access to the eu's single market for goods, but not for many services, including most financial services (although Switzerland accepts free movement of people and is even a member of the Schengen passport-free zone). Over the past decade the eu and Switzerland have engaged in often grumpy negotiations to create a single governance structure for these measures rather like the one that will now be in place for Britain. Cross-retaliation has been common: 18 months ago, in a dispute over judicial oversight, the eu peremptorily withdrew its equivalence ruling for the Swiss stock exchange.
Swiss officials now devote much time and effort to poring over eu legislative proposals, Swiss diplomats to negotiating with Brussels. Yet however well they do their jobs, the imbalance with the eu puts them at a disadvantage. Britain is bigger than Switzerland, but it will be the supplicant in almost any negotiation. Brexiteers celebrating their country's great escape will find that the future is not so blissfully free of the eu as they might hope."

What Britons lose after Brexit
Aroman travelling anywhere in the empire from modern-day Carlisle to Damascus was said to have his safety guaranteed by declaring: ""Civis Romanus sum."" The Maastricht treaty of 1992 created a similar notion of European citizenship, affording the bearer rights superior to domestic law throughout the bloc, which compel officials, bosses and judges to treat all Europeans as the equals of their compatriots.
From this grand idea spring a thousand small perks, making going on holiday or serving a client abroad effortless. Britons will have plenty of time to consider them as they finger their new dark-blue passports in the non-EU queues at European airports.
Britons who settled on the continent before Brexit will have the rights of citizenship preserved under the Brexit withdrawal agreement. For everyone else, they will drop away as Big Ben strikes 11pm on December 31st. How Britons are treated thereafter will depend on the rules agreed in Mr Johnson's new deal, the long-standing provisions of European law which apply to all ""third-country nationals"" from Americans to Zimbabweans, and the migration laws of individual eu states, which change with the political weather. Those holidaying on the continent for a fortnight a year may notice a little more hassle. Those who wish to go for longer-to study, or spend the summer in a second home-will find their rights and options curtailed dramatically.
eu citizens face almost no restrictions on moving to another state for work or leisure, and can cross borders more or less as they please. After Brexit, Britons will be limited to up to 90 days travel at a time without a visa within a six-month period. Border guards may demand proof of their plans, a return ticket, and that they have enough money for their stay. (Eurostar has urged all travellers to the continent after Brexit to arrive earlier than they used to.) Britons will lose the right to use automatic passport gates, and will receive rubber stamps in their passports.
Doing business will be much trickier: no longer will Britain be able to treat the eu as its home market. Business travellers will be able to visit for up to 90 days for meetand-greet activities, such as attending sales meetings, trade fairs or conferences. But generally speaking, delivering a service-such as auditing accounts, playing in a concert or working as a chef-will require a work visa, and in many regulated sectors getting registered as a local professional too. Visa policy is largely a matter for national governments, which have their own criteria of skills, language requirements and fees that vary depending on the needs of the labour market. British students, no longer entitled to equal treatment, are likely to pay much higher fees for places at European universities.
Motorists will need to carry a green card, showing their insurance is valid. eu laws that prohibit customers from being hit with roaming charges when they use their mobile telephones abroad will drop away. Whether fees return depends on the deals that operators strike with their European counterparts; big operators, such as Vodafone, will have more clout than smaller ones. Britain will drop out of the eu's pet-passport regime, which documents animals' vaccinations and allows holidaymakers to take dogs and cats abroad; owners will instead need to obtain an animal health certificate from their vet each time they travel. Not all is lost, however. Under Mr Johnson's plan, Britain hopes to retain a variant of the European Health Insurance Card, which grants holidaymakers emergency health care when on the continent.
Retiring to a place in the sun will be a trickier affair, particularly for those on tight budgets. Each country has its own rules for foreign pensioners who want to stay. They typically need a minimum income and medical insurance. British owners of property abroad will be more vulnerable to tax raids too: in 2015, the European Court of Justice struck down a French tax on properties owned by other European nationals as incompatible with European Union law. Such protection against official whim is the difference between being a guest in a foreign land, and being someone who can declare: ""Civis Europaeus sum."""

BELFAST
A new border inside the uk brings Northern Ireland closer to the republic
Like many people, Viviane Gravey became more interested in gardening during lockdown. She bought dill and lettuce seeds from Real Seeds, a firm in Wales, and grew them on her balcony. But next year's crop will have to come from another source, for the firm emailed her to say that, because of the new border in the Irish Sea, it would no longer sell to Northern Ireland.
During the fraught negotiations over the uk-eu trade deal, a number of British firms stopped supplying Northern Ireland. Now that the deal is done, some may return to the market, but the new border will raise costs. Firms may pass them on to consumers or decide that the Northern Irish market is too small to bother with.
The internal border is the result of the determination of the Irish and British governments to avoid the creation of a ""hard"" border on the island of Ireland. Negotiations on the withdrawal agreement nearly collapsed over this issue. Boris Johnson's solution was to leave Northern Ireland in the eu's single market for goods, bound by eu regulations. eu customs rules will be enforced at Northern Irish ports.
Goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will need new paperwork. From April 1st, for instance, when a grace period ends, animal products will need export health certificates. Aodhán Connolly, director of the ni Retail Consortium, says that a typical supermarket lorry carries 200-300 products of animal origin. The necessary certificates will cost thousands of pounds. All goods being shipped will need customs codes and some require Meursing codes, which determine how much duty is payable. Lorries will be allowed on ferries only if codes are correct.
Mr Johnson had pledged ""unfettered"" access to Great Britain for Northern Irish firms, and has largely delivered that. But if goods cannot travel easily from east to west, that will hamper trade in the other direction, for Northern Irish firms need empty lorries in which to transport their goods.
Still, there are likely to be some upsides for the Northern Irish economy. Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing ni says that highly regulated manufacturing sectors such as pharmaceuticals will benefit from having a foot in both the eu and uk markets. Goods produced in Northern Ireland will be able to circulate freely in the eu, and the uk has agreed that those goods can also freely enter the British market. ""The more regulated your industry, the bigger the benefit,"" says Mr Kelly.
As the gap between Northern Ireland and Great Britain widens, that between the province and the republic is narrowing. Ireland regards itself as the defender of Northern Irish interests in the eu, and has given this commitment practical effect by announcing that it will pay for continued Northern Irish access to both eu emergency health care and the Erasmus student exchange programme. The bill for Erasmus will be €2.im ($2.6m), but according to Simon Harris, Ireland's minister for universities, ""It's not a cost; it's an investment...in our next generation.""
That next generation is likely to vote in a future referendum on Irish unification. Brexit has moved Northern Ireland farther from the uk and closer to the republic. In itself, this will not reunite Ireland, but the leap is getting smaller."

The approval of AstraZeneca's vaccine will greatly accelerate the roll-out
This year more than 600,000 Britons received an early Christmas present: a Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The early start of the roll-out-enabled by the speedy work of the country's regulator, the MHRA-puts Britain near the front of the global pack. Only Bahrain and Israel have delivered more doses per person (see chart).
The government had hoped things would be faster still, only for delays at Pfizer to put a spanner in the works. January will be a different story. The firm's factories are now up to speed. And on December 30th, the MHRA gave emergency authorisation to another vaccine, from AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
This one is cheaper, easier to distribute and more plentiful. The plan is for mass vaccination centres to dish out hundreds of thousands of doses a day, quickly reducing the number of deaths. Distribution will begin on January 4th.
One of the big debates was around the dosing strategy. The original trial showed two doses of the vaccine were more than 62% effective, but also offered tantalising evidence of protection as high as 90% when the first dose was halved. (As with all the covid-19 vaccines, it is completely effective at preventing death however it is given.) The question was if there was the data to support a half-dose strategy.
In the end, the mhra went for a twodose strategy-but with a twist. Some, including a former prime minister, Tony Blair, had argued that single doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine should be rolled out immediately, rather than holding back supply for a second dose. That would allow for speedier vaccination. Yet the concern over giving only one dose of any two-dose vaccine is that individuals do not get the full benefit of vaccination, even if it helps the population at large.
A potential solution lay hidden in the AstraZeneca data. The firm says that a longish gap between doses, of as much as three months, is fine. Having analysed the data, the mhra agreed, deciding to give single doses to everyone, with follow-up jabs as far as three months down the line. That could double the number of people who can be vaccinated in the next few months.
The call is of international importance. Now the mhra has authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine, other countries will probably follow suit. One watching closely is India, which started producing the vaccine in April, and has about 40m doses ready to go.
The government is tight-lipped about how many are ready in Britain. But in November AstraZeneca said it would have enough bulk substance for 20m doses, and that 4m would be in vials by the end of the year. That would be enough substance to give a first dose to every front-line healthand social-care worker, everyone in a care home, everyone who is clinically vulnerable, everyone with underlying health conditions and everyone over the age of 60.
Because fatalities are concentrated among the old and vulnerable, doing so would prevent almost all deaths. Given that the health service vaccinates 15m or so people in a normal flu season, and does so without mass vaccination centres, it ought to be doable in the next few months. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was confident that enough vulnerable people will be vaccinated by spring that there would be a ""route out of this pandemic"". So long as neither vaccine-resistant strains nor supply problems emerge, covid-19 will soon be a much less deadly disease. *"

How Britain went from enthusiastic commitment to the eu to an acrimonious departure on unfavourable terms
The vote in the House of Commons to approve Britain's membership of the European Economic Community on October 28th 1971 was greeted with widespread jubilation. The ""yes vote was larger than expected, and it passed with a majority of 112. Leading politicians went off to celebrate in different ways-some to parties, while the famously buttoned-up prime minister, Edward Heath (pictured), returned to Downing Street in a mood of elation and played the first prelude and fugue from Bach's ""The Well-Tempered
Clavier . As Britain completes its departure from the eu half a century later, there is little celebration. Even determined Eurosceptics complain about the terms of the withdrawal treaty, particularly over fishing. Others are regretful if not furious: according to the latest poll, 48% of Britons now think the country should remain in the eu, while 38% think it should leave. There is nervousness, especially among the businesses that trade with Europe, about how the relationship will work. And there is residual puzzlement on both sides. How did it go
so wrong? Britain's history meant it was always ambivalent towards the European ""project . For most continental countries, building European unity was a reaction to the horrors of the second world war and its aftermath. The Germans were escaping Nazism, the French defeat and collaboration, the Italians dictatorship, the eastern Europeans, when they eventually joined, Soviet domination. Britain was the only member that felt no need to escape from its past- indeed, in many ways, it preferred wallowing in the past to confronting the future. For Britain, unlike the rest of Europe, the nation state is something to be celebrated
rather than transcended. Britain's imperial history also made a difference. Its empire was larger and more recent than other European nations'. Culturally, the British feel closer to America, Canada and Australia than they do to Europe. Two-and-a-half times as many British expatriates live in the English-speaking world as on the continent, and Britain's main ethnic minorities are from Commonwealth countries. That English is the language of the world gives monoglot Britons the sense that they are
at home anywhere. Politics on both sides of the channel reflected this ambivalence; Heath's passionate Europhilia was unusual. Charles de Gaulle famously vetoed Britain's first application to join in 1963 on the grounds that Britain ""is insular, she is maritime, she is linked through her exchanges, her markets, her supply lines to the most diverse and often the most distant countries . Most of Britain's leading post-war politicians shared the general's doubts. Harold Macmillan, a Conservative prime minister, worried about the emergence of a ""boastful, powerful 'Empire of Charlemagne' and applied to join in part in order to change Europe from within. Hugh Gaitskell, the Labour leader, worried that a federal Europe would mean ""the end of Britain as an independent European state...the end of
a thousand years of history . Politicians' doubts led a Labour government to hold a referendum on membership in 1975, only two years after joining. But strike-ridden Britain was a mess and Europe seemed to offer a more stable and prosperous future. Over two-thirds of voters wanted to stay. The establishment, too, had come round. The Economist put a picture of a young member of staff wearing a tight т-shirt, emblazoned with ""Europe or bust , on the cover. Margaret Thatcher, subsequently a Eurosceptic pin-up, campaigned enthusiastically for continued membership (pictured overleaf), and in the 1980s it was she who persuaded the union to take its most
important step forward of that decade-the single market. From the start, Britain was unhappy about the terms of its membership. Farming was the main point of contention. Committed to free trade in food since the abolition of the corn laws in 1846, Britain had a tiny agricultural sector compared with its neighbours and enjoyed cheap food. The EEC kept farmers in business by imposing high tariffs, making consumers pay high prices and handing out subsidies. As a result, Britain was the second-largest contributor to the European budget,
until Thatcher got ""our money back in 1984. But it was supra-nationalism that most bothered the British. From the first Britain saw itself as the champion of a Europe of nation-states that came together voluntarily to make the business of the world easier to conduct. But in the eyes of its founders, Europe was a political project whose purpose was to bind the continent so tightly that future conflict would be inconceivable. As Europe
moved towards an ""ever closer
union , the tensions grew. Two speeches and a treaty In the 1980s Euroscepticism was confined to the extremes. Its leading champions were Enoch Powell, so far to the right that he had parted company with the Tories, and Tony Benn, a hard-left Labour man. Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, did much to change that. He gave a speech to the Trades Union Congress in 1988 in which he anticipated that most future legislation would come from Europe. Thatcher responded with her Bruges speech: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them reimposed at a European level with a European superstate exercising
a new dominance from Brussels. union closer together, and Britain and the other member states further apart. The eu's residents became ""citizens of the Union"" with fundamental rights including the freedom to live wherever they wanted. The word ""economic"", which had first attracted Britain, was dropped. The adoption of a single currency created pressure for evergreater pooling of sovereignty. Optimists thought that Britain could have its cake and eat it by being half in and half out. Pessimists argued that the pressure to pool sovereignty would make this position impossible to maintain.
Those speeches and that treaty served to recruit young enthusiasts, such as Daniel Hannan, who joined the older hard core of Eurosceptic Tory mps such as Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood. Outside Parliament, the movement coalesced into pressure groups such as the Bruges Group and Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum Party. The United Kingdom Independence Party (ukip), a bunch of provincials ridiculed by metropolitan Europhiles, got nowhere in Westminster elections but made ground in European ones.
Three men and an issue
The global rise of populism after the financial crisis poured fuel on these sparks. Britain proved especially susceptible, partly because of the size of its financial sector, and partly because David Cameron's government slashed spending, hurting poor areas most. The Labour Party lurched to the left, electing Jeremy Corbyn, a hard-left Eurosceptic, as leader. ukip grew in strength, snapping at Mr Cameron's heels, demanding a referendum. In order to weaken its position in the 2015 election, he promised one-believing, in his hubristic way, that if he actually had to hold one, he would be able to swing it. To his surprise, he won the election-having fallen into the trap the Eurosceptics had set him.
The Leave campaign's victory was forged by three men and an issue. Boris Johnson, formerly mayor of London, provided a smiling face as the front for a movement that had usually worn a snarl. Dominic Cummings, the campaign's ideologue, provided it with the brains it had previously lacked. But the Leave campaign's most powerful weapon was perhaps Mr Corbyn. His lukewarm campaigning for Remain and known distaste for the eu probably tipped the result for Leave.
The issue was immigration. Britain had supported the eastward expansion of the eu partly on the ground that a larger Europe seemed like an alternative to a deeper one. But enlargement gave low-paid Europeans a chance to better themselves by moving to Britain, thanks to Tony Blair's refusal to follow 12 other eu countries in making use of a seven-year brake on citizens of the new states exercising their right to work. The number of Polish-born residents in the uk increased from 56,000 in 2001 to 911,000 in 2016 and Romanians from 14,000 in 2004 to 310,000 in 2016.
In places into which eastern Europeans had flooded, the Leave vote was especially high. But immigration had a broader, more pervasive effect on the vote. The government's failure to reduce the foreigners' numbers, despite repeated promises to do so, contributed to the feeling that Britain had lost control of its destiny in the most important aspect of national policy-determining who lives inside your borders. To vote ""out"" was, in the Leave campaign's slogan, to ""take back control"".
Four players and a dangerous game
Even difficult marriages are hard to end. Over half a century, European legislation had become part of the warp and weft of British law and European and British business thoroughly entwined. Lawyers contracted thinking about rights to their European counterparts. Businesses happily embraced European regulations.
The nature of the referendum made leaving all the harder. Voters were offered a binary choice about a complicated set of relationships. There was nothing on the ballot paper about the single market, the customs union or how the 500km-long border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland, freighted with history and fraught with tension, should be dealt with. The asymmetry between the complexity of the problem and the simplicity of the question ensured that the referendum debate was both shallow and mendacious.
Given how many issues the referendum left undecided, the terms of Britain's departure could have been settled in any number of different ways; and the close result-48:52-argued for the ""soft"" Brexit that most mps favoured, with Britain remaining close to Europe. That the outcome has been a ""hard"" Brexit, with Britain leaving both the single market and the customs union, is a consequence of the way four interested parties chose to play their hands.
For Theresa May, a Remainer bounced into the premiership after Mr Cameron's ignominious resignation in the wake of the referendum, offering a ""hard"" Brexit looked like a way of keeping the right wing of her party onside. The 2017 election shrank her majority and made her their hostage. When she softened her position on Brexit, they got rid of her and replaced her with Mr Johnson, who boldly sacked a bunch of recalcitrant Remainers, bringing the parliamentary party to heel.
For Mr Corbyn, opposing the Tories' position was more important than achieving an outcome that kept Britain close to the European Union. For the Liberal Democrats, a purist determination to overturn the result looked like the best way of distinguishing their position from Labour's, so they went into the 2019 election with the slogan ""Bollocks to Brexit"". The clash of absolutes eliminated the middle ground.
The Europeans also contributed to the ""hard"" outcome. They could have compromised with Mrs May when she was desperately trying to sell her softer deal. But member states had their own particular demands-so, for instance, negotiations went to the wire over French fishermen's insistence on continued access to British waters-and the eu wanted to make it plain that those who leave the club cannot enjoy the benefits of membership.
The vote to leave thus led to one of the most turbulent periods in recent British history. Careers, such as Mrs May's, were made and destroyed with extraordinary speed. Precedents were broken. When the government prorogued Parliament to get its way it was slapped down by the Supreme Court. The Conservative Party, once the party of toffs and the middle class, was rebranded as anti-European and workingclass. And a country which had been lukewarm about the continent saw the birth of a pro-European movement flying the European flag daily in Parliament Square.
The ructions are not over. The referendum has strained the United Kingdom's bonds. Scotland voted for Remain by a large majority and Northern Ireland by a smaller one. To avoid creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the republic, a border has been established inside the United Kingdom, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That will have consequences. A majority of Scots now want independence, and support for Irish unification is growing. The most striking consequence of that historic day in 2016 might not be Britain's exit from a European Union that it never loved but the break-up of the nation-state whose sovereignty the Brexiteers sought to defend."

BERLIN
With Angela Merkel preparing to step down, German politics are growing wobbly
""What a presidency it has been!"" After a gruelling all-night eu summit in mid-December, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, reserved her biggest smile for Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor. The summit, at which the eu's leaders found agreement on a number of tricky issues, capped Germany's six-month presidency of the eu Council, which it will hand over to Portugal on January 1st. It may also prove to be the high-water mark of Mrs Merkel's final term in office.
One year ago Mrs Merkel was starting to cut a diminished figure. Having promised not to stand for a fifth term, she buried herself in foreign policy while the scrap to succeed her began to consume domestic politics. Her centre-right Christian Democratic Union (cdu) was below 30% in polls, riven by squabbles that forced Annegret KrampKarrenbauer, Mrs Merkel's presumed heir, to quit as cdu leader. The chancellor's succession plans lay in tatters.
Two things changed the mood. The first was the pandemic, which thrust Mrs Merkel onto centre-stage again. In a televised address on March 18th she grabbed Germans' attention by describing the novel coronavirus as the country's greatest challenge since 1945. More recently, as Germany battles a deadlier second wave, she has delivered impassioned pleas in parliament to lock down harder and faster (the constitution reserves such powers to the states). Germany's early success in keeping deaths down, its strong fiscal response and Mrs Merkel's calm bearing restored her fortunes. She now basks in approval ratings of over 70%, and her party's standing has rocketed (see chart on next page).
Then came the eu Council presidency. As the strains of covid-19 tested Europe's bonds, Mrs Merkel broke the German taboo against common debt and agreed to a €750bn ($916bn) EU-wide fund to aid recovery in 2021and beyond. She later persuaded the troublesome governments of Poland and Hungary to sign on to new rule-of-law provisions in the eu's budget rules, and helped arrange a tightening of the eu's climate targets. December brought more success: having avoided a no-deal Brexit, the EU looked set, as The Economist went to press, to agree on the outline of an investment deal with China. That is a prize long sought by Mrs Merkel, though it irks Europe's growing band of Sinosceptics and the incoming Biden administration.
Little wonder Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister, says that voters have failed to register that the chancellor is on her way out. Yet as the eu presidency and the worst phase of the pandemic recede into the past, Mrs Merkel's star may fade faster than expected. In 2021 a series of political events will build towards the general election in September, reminding voters that the Merkel era will soon be over.
The first is the election of a new cdu leader at a virtual party congress on January 16th. The three men standing for the job see it as a stepping-stone to the chancellery. Yet the campaign has been dispiriting, and not only because covid-19 postponed the voting twice. The debates have been platitudinous, and cdu grandees appear to fear that too vigorous a contest over the party's post-Merkel future might expose hard-to-heal divisions just months before an election campaign.
None of the three has captured the imagination of the party's supporters. The periodic outbursts of Friedrich Merz, a flinty tax-cut advocate, excite the cdu's conservative base but worry moderates who know German elections are won from the middle. Armin Laschet, the bland if jovial leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, has no obvious pitch beyond Merkellian centrism; his poll numbers have nosedived. Norbert Röttgen, a foreign-policy expert once sacked by Mrs Merkel, was originally written off. A lively campaign appealing to women and the young has put him into contention, but he remains an outsider.
Some cdu figures grumble more or less openly that Mr Spahn, who has handled the pressures of his job well, is better suited to leadership than Mr Laschet, to whom he has pledged fealty. Many also gaze longingly towards Bavaria and Markus Söder, its charismatic premier and head of the Christian Social Union (csu), the cdu's sister party. The larger cdu would normally expect a decisive say when the two parties pick a joint candidate for the chancellorship, probably in the spring. But a string of confident performances during the covid crisis have transformed Mr Söder into one of Germany's most popular politicians. His denials of interest in the top job have failed to stop the question from being asked.
All this leaves the cdu with a problem. Of the three most popular conservative politicians in Germany, one (Mrs Merkel) is retiring; another (Mr Spahn) is holding fire; and a third (Mr Söder) claims to have no further ambitions. The three men seeking to run the cdu, meanwhile, languish an embarrassing distance behind. Whether Mr Spahn and Mr Söder can keep their ambition in check remains to be seen. But the cdu's uncomfortable position will concentrate minds among the 1,001party delegates charged with choosing their next leader.
All sides acknowledge that the cdu/ csu's strong polling conceals a large ""Merkel-bonus"" that will largely expire before the election. It will be easier to see how big it is once the party picks a new leader. The ascendant Greens, who briefly overtook the cdu/csu in 2019, hope to soak up some centrist votes, particularly if Mr Merz wins in January. So does Olaf Scholz, the mildmannered finance minister and vice-chancellor, who will lead the Social Democrats (spd) into the election. But his early consecration as chancellor-candidate has so far failed to lift his party's dismal ratings.
Germany's parties will also compete in five state elections in 2021. Two in Germany's east may test the cdu's firewall against co-operation with the hard right Alternative for Germany. But the most significant, in March, will be in BadenWürttemberg, a rich southern state led by the Greens in coalition with the cdu. That arrangement may prove a dry run for a national coalition, but with the cdu/csu as senior partner. Both parties are visibly preparing for such a ""black-green"" coalition, but a head-spinning array of other configurations are possible in what is set to be Germany's most unpredictable election in decades. Mrs Merkel prizes stability above almost all else, but there will be less and less of it as she prepares to relinquish the country's leadership. *"

For Europe, the deal makes the best of a bad business
When the trade deal between the eu and Britain was done, there was little celebration in Brussels. Instead, the moaning began. ""This is a dark day for the European fishing industry,"" declared Gerard van Balsfoort, chairman of the European Fisheries Alliance, a lobby group for fishermen. Indeed, conflict over matters piscatorial dominated the final stages of the negotiations, leaving economists flabbergasted that such a tiny sector could hook so much attention.
Yet there is more to life than mackerel. On the whole, the eu is content if not happy with how things turned out. From the union's perspective, it was important that Britain's departure was orderly; that it left Britain with worse trading access than the status quo; and, consequent to that, that it removed any temptation for other countries to follow the Brexiteers out. The eu has a good claim to say it managed all three.
Britain's exit followed a rigid process dictated by the eu . Although the Vote Leave campaign had pledged not to use Article 50, the official process for leaving laid out in the eu's founding treaty, the British ultimately triggered it. (eu officials privately claimed credit for goading them to do so.) Negotiations took place according to the eu's schedule. The remaining 27 member states were not divided, which back in the mists of 2016 had been a worry for diplomats. The things the eu cared most about were dealt with in both the withdrawal agreement reached last January (which sorted out citizens' rights, the Irish border and how much money Britain owed the union) and the trade agreement reached over Christmas (where a deal was struck over eu fishing rights in British waters, despite griping from Mr van Balsfoort's constituents). By contrast, big British interests, such as the rights of the country's enormous financial sector to do business in Europe, have still to be decided.
To anyone not obsessed with romantic notions of sovereignty, it is clear that the deal leaves Britain worse-off than with eu membership. European officials distributed graphics explaining what Britain would miss, ranging from the big stuff (financial passporting for banks, Britons losing the right to live and work in 27 countries) to the small (no more pet passports, no guaranteed cheap mobile-phone roaming). In public, officials made clear that the negative effects of Brexit were the inevitable consequence of leaving the bloc. In private, they spoke of the need to drive Britain's face into the mud. The eu does not want a successful rival on its borders, and the threadbare deal agreed will not help Britain become one. After the four years of political chaos during which Britain laboured to extricate itself, Euroscepticism in other eu countries has gone off the boil. The British showed that there is a path for anyone wishing to leave the union. But it is costly, arduous and leads to a backwater.
Brexit is still bad for the bloc, even with a deal. Given that its claim to being a superpower relies on its economic clout, watch- ing gdp equivalent to 18 of its 27 countries walk out of the door is not good. About a quarter of eu defence spending went as well. The fact that it was on amicable rather than chaotic terms only slightly sweetened the pill. Instead, Britain joins the club of the eu's awkward neighbours. The deal provides a rather wobbly foundation for a new relationship between Britain and the continent (see Britain section). As a result, the eu faces years of tweaks to its relationship with a country whose population is nearly eight times that of Switzerland, with which it has similarly frustrating ties.
Brexit is not an existential concern for the eu, as some feared it would become. The eu will enjoy a strained relationship with a neighbour too small to worry much about, but too big to ignore. Given that the eu is seven times the size of Britain, it should be able to handle it as it does the rest of its fragile frontier. But it is a problem the union, surrounded by instability on its borders from north Africa to Turkey to Russia and challenged from within by democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, would rather not have. When it comes to Brexit, there is no such thing as a good deal for the eu. *"

Alexei Navalny exposes the agents who tried to kill him
Stay abroad or rot in jail. That was the choice Vladimir Putin offered this week to Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician currently in Germany recovering from an attempt by Russian security agents to assassinate him last August. The new threat was delivered by Russia's federal prison agency, which accused Mr Navalny of violating a probation period imposed as part of a trumped-up embezzlement conviction in 2014. It was an obvious sham: the probation period expired on December 30th, but on December 28th Mr Navalny was ordered to attend a parole hearing in Moscow at 9am the following morning, or trigger a suspended sentence of three and a half years.
The following day, Russian authorities launched a new and larger embezzlement case against Mr Navalny. He remained unfazed. ""Putin desperately does not want me to return to Russia,"" he told The Economist. ""I am planning to do what I always said I would do: come back.""
The prospect of Mr Navalny returning ahead of parliamentary elections in 2021 has worried the Kremlin ever since September, when he emerged from a coma after collapsing during a flight over Siberia in August. He had been evacuated to Berlin, where doctors determined he had been poisoned with novichok, a Russian military nerve agent. Since then he and his allies have been busy. On December 14th Mr Navalny's team, along with Bellingcat (a digital forensics group) and the Insider (a Russian investigative outfit), published a joint investigation into the plot to kill him. It included the names and movements of a team of agents of the fsb, a state security agency, who had trailed Mr Navalny since 2017, when he said he would run for president. Using passenger lists, mobile-phone pings and other data, much of it acquired on the dark web, the investigation showed that fsb agents with ties to chemical-weapons facilities had been near Mr Navalny when he was poisoned.
Mr Putin was forced to admit that fsb agents had followed Mr Navalny, but claimed they did so because he had ties to the cia. There was more to come. On December 21st Mr Navalny released a video of himself telephoning one of his alleged would-be assassins: Konstantin Kudryavtsev, a chemical-weapons specialist with the fsb. Mr Navalny used software that made the call appear to be coming from inside fsb headquarters, and posed as an assistant gathering information for the head of Russia's national security council. The hapless agent spent 49 minutes explaining how the operation had gone wrong. Pressed for detail, Mr Kudryavtsev explained that the poison had been applied to Mr Navalny's underpants. ""On the groin area?"" Mr Navalny inquired. ""Well, the socalled codpiece,"" the agent answered.
Within hours, the video of Mr Navalny's conversation had 7m views on YouTube. Blue men's underpants became a political meme. Several Russian activists, including Vitaly Mansky, a well-known documentary director, turned up in front of fsb headquarters demonstratively holding out pairs of blue briefs. They were promptly detained for employing ""visual means of propaganda and agitation"".
Mr Navalny's videos have confirmed what Western governments said from the start: the fsb was behind the assassination attempt. But more important is the political impact inside the country. The videos have shredded the agency's image as an efficient secret order untouched by the country's corruption and professional degradation-a myth first cultivated by the fsb's predecessor, the Soviet kgb. That myth, notes Kirill Rogov, a political analyst, was skillfully exploited by Mr Putin, a former kgb operative, when he first presented himself to the Russian public as an antidote to the chaos of the 1990s.
The use of invisible poisons is meant to enhance the security services' aura of mystery and omnipotence. But Mr Navalny's Gogolesque conversation with his pursuer was a humiliating destruction of the myth. Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist, compared its symbolism to the moment in 1987 when Mathias Rust, an 18year-old German pilot, landed a small plane near the Kremlin, making a mockery of the Soviet Union's supposedly impenetrable air-defence system.
Mr Navalny's investigation may not have convinced many Russians that Mr Putin ordered him poisoned. The Levada Centre, a pollster, says about 15% of the population believe this version. Yet 19% accept Mr Putin's ludicrous theory that the poisoning was a cia plot. Most Russians think the poisoning never happened, or prefer not to think about it. Still, the revelations undermine Mr Putin's claim at his December press conference that ""if [the fsb] really wanted to poison him, they would have finished the job."" The humiliated agency may yet try to prove Mr Putin right."

The french, wrote George Canning, a British statesman, to a ministerial colleague in 1825, ""have but two rules of action: to thwart us whenever they know our object; and when they know it not, to imagine one, and to set about thwarting that."" Canning's grumble, made a decade after the end of the Napoleonic wars, sounds oddly familiar two centuries later. And today it is not only the British who follow what might be called Canning's law: when in doubt, blame the French. Suspicion of France's intentions, and criticism of its actions, have been on the rise in several other countries, in sometimes understandable but often perplexing ways.
Exhibit A is, of course, Brexit. ""Only preening Emmanuel Macron stands in the way of Boris Johnson's triumph,"" thundered the Daily Mail when a deal seemed improbable. Downing Street hyped up French demands, and vowed to dispatch gunboats to defend British fishing waters. Yet other eu leaders too had threatened to walk away from talks. When Britain announced a new covid-19 strain had got out of control, several eu countries shut their borders. Yet ""Covidiot Macron"" was uniquely pilloried. A British official accused the French of ""trying to take food off our shelves for Christmas out of spite."" Britain, it seemed, had fallen victim to sly Gallic posturing, designed to punish and enfeeble an old rival.
Or consider the finger-pointing directed at France after recent terrorist attacks against the country. In the wake of the beheading in October 2020 of Samuel Paty, a schoolteacher who had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, Mr Macron became a public enemy in parts of the Muslim world. His offence was to have defended the French law on freedom of expression that protects blasphemy (against any religion). As a false rumour spread that France was to give Muslim children id numbers, a Pakistani government minister tweeted: ""Macron is doing to Muslims what the Nazis did to the Jews."" This absurd tweet was later retracted. Not so the comment by Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declaring the French president mentally ill.
It is hardly surprising that authoritarian regimes find Mr Macron a useful whipping boy-a bit of outrage directed at foreigners distracts people from injustice closer to home. More wounding for the French is that some parts of the American media accuse France of being peculiarly responsible for breeding terrorists. To be sure, there are legitimate and complex questions to be asked about the French model of secularism known as laicité, and whether a new bill to combat Islamism confuses conservative religiosity with opposition to democratic governance. Yet France is hardly Europe's only incubator of terrorism. Just over a decade ago it was British multiculturalism that was widely blamed for Islamist radicalisation, notes Lorenzo Vidino, director of George Washington University's programme on extremism. As a share of population, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden-none of them practitioners of French secularism-sent more jihadist fighters to Syria and Iraq than France did.
Some of the criticism France draws abroad is fair. It has pursued a few half-baked ideas, such as seeking a security partnership with Vladimir Putin's Russia. Mr Macron's assertion that Islam is ""in crisis"" around the world was particularly ill-judged. He indulged in some counterproductive tough talk on Brexit, partly because he enjoys saying things in public that other Europeans prefer to say behind closed doors. Indeed, the French president seems to relish controversy, whether he is decrying nato's ""brain death"" or sending French warships to defend Greek waters from Turkish oil and gas exploration. Such outspokenness and pesky unilateralism are familiar themes in French history, and they have often bred distrust on the part of baffled allies. ""I must confess, my dear General,"" wrote President Dwight Eisenhower to Charles de Gaulle in i960, with magnificent restraint,""that I cannot quite understand the basic philosophy of France today.""
All of which raises two thoughts and a paradox. The first thought might be summed up as ""Foucault's revenge"". America's left, with its embrace of identity politics and scepticism towards universal individualist values, is deeply influenced by the postmodern French critical theorists of the 1970s. Yet France's leaders are unapologetic defenders of just such universal individualist values, which are among the country's founding principles. American liberals, who had thought Mr Macron one of them, struggle to make sense of a liberal French leader who curbs religious expression. It feels like a betrayal.
Emmanuel in Paris
A second reflection touches on why the French are considered fair game. ""France has been the beneficiary, particularly among Americans, of a constructed fantasy,"" suggests Matthew Fraser, at the American University of Paris. This is the romantic promise of intellectual sophistication, culture and effortless chic. Captured in exaggerated form by the Netflix series ""Emily in Paris"", it is an ideal embodied by those Americans-Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Richard Wright-who adopted Paris in the 20th century. Nobody likes to mock an underdog. But France, selfsatisfied and secretly envied, seems as if it can take the ribbing.
And so to the paradox. France finds itself picked upon at a time when Europe has seldom been so open to embracing French ideas. French proposals that were once politely read and shelved by European friends-common eu debt issuance, taxes on tech giants, sanctions on Turkey, even ""strategic autonomy"" in defence-are no longer debated only in the parquet-floored salons of Paris. They are increasingly approved by the eu. For Mr Macron, whose visibility will grow in 2021 as Angela Merkel's chancellorship ends, this presents both an opportunity and a peril. The harder the French president pushes his ideas, the more progress he may make, but the more he may irritate others. Every story needs a villain, and as Canning knew, the French make a tempting one."

WASHINGTON, DC
Congress injects a further $900bn of stimulus into the economy, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown
One in eight American adults in December reported going hungry during the previous week. This was, according to the Census Bureau's regular surveys, the worst result of the final three months of 2020. That tracked other measures of financial distress-the share of Americans estimated to be in poverty or reporting difficulties paying for housing-which have increased as the covid-19 epidemic entered a third, wintry phase and chilled the economic recovery. The burden has been felt most by the disadvantaged: in households with less than $25,000 in income, 32% of adults reported having to miss meals in the past seven days. More than 40% of black and Hispanic renters have little to no confidence in being able to pay for housing in the coming month.
All this-to say nothing of the death toll of the virus, which is now above 330,000- got worse while Congress debated for seven months whether the economy needed more support. The big fiscal stimulus passed in March, costing $2.2trn, made a real and measurable dent in hardship in the first months of virus-induced lockdowns. One-time cheques of $1,200 for most American adults and generous topups of $600 a week to unemployment benefits were part of a temporary experiment with a European-style safety-net. Government expenditure in 2020 increased by about 50% compared with the previous year, easily the greatest increase since 1963, when the Congressional Budget Office started counting. The result was that the savings rate among families went up, not down. Poverty was probably cut by 15%, the biggest one-off reduction recorded since measurement began.
Many of the provisions in that first stimulus expired in the summer of 2020, as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach an agreement on a successor stimulus bill. Poverty crept back up beyond its old levels. The impasse was broken only after the presidential election was (mostly) past, and as negotiations were tied to legislation needed to keep the federal government open. At the last possible moment, days before the end of the legislative term, a compromise was reached.
Frantic negotiations led to a 5,600-page piece of legislation to spend $900bn released only a few hours before it was passed by large majorities of both chambers. It is more modest than the previous stimulus. The weekly top-up to unemployment benefits will be $300, and these payments will only go on until March. Another round of cheques, worth $600 this time, will be disbursed to most Americans. A moratorium on evictions will be extended, though it is not clear what will happen to the mountain of rent arrears or what compensation is owed to landlords.
President Donald Trump, self-proclaimed master of the art of the deal, will close out his presidency having never ? abandoned the role of bit-player to the various legislative dramas of his term-from the failed attempt to repeal Obamacare, to the tax cuts passed in 2017, to the spending bonanza triggered by covid-19. Still, his final performance should take the prize for buffoonery. The day after Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary and the president's chief negotiator, called the bill ""fabulous"" as it passed Congress, Mr Trump decided that it was really a ""disgrace"" and suggested he would veto it unless the cheques were supersized to $2,000 per American. This red line had not been mentioned by the White House as it was negotiating with Democrats in Congress; the excessive spending on foreign aid that Mr Trump also expressed disdain for was the same amount his budget office had called for in its request to lawmakers.
Having vented his frustration with Congress (and especially with Republicans who are only lukewarmly entertaining his efforts to overturn his election loss), Mr Trump relented and signed the legislation on December 27th, two days before the federal government would have shut down. The deal-master's tantrum was not without consequence, though. He has put Mitch McConnell in a bind: the Senate Majority leader would rather not have a vote on increasing the cheques to $2,000, as the president is still calling for, making him a target of the presidential Twitter feed.
Only a few more weeks of Mr Trump's drama remain. For Joe Biden, the president-in-waiting, the new stimulus sets the initial economic conditions for his administration. It is a short window. The enhanced unemployment benefits will expire before his first 100 days are up, and probably before widespread vaccination triggers an economic recovery. Mr Biden has expressed interest in a subsequent round of stimulus, perhaps one tethered to a green infrastructure programme, but his legislative leverage may prove limited.
In approximately three weeks' time, Republicans are likely to become overwhelmingly concerned with the federal deficit and the national debt (which ballooned during the Trump administration). This will be the main cudgel used to clobber Mr Biden's policy ambitions. Indeed, this is likely to be the final round of stimulus if Democrats fail to flip two Senate seats in Georgia, which will be decided by a run-off election on January 5th.
In the ideal version of American politics, economic-recovery legislation would be proportionate to crisis indicators, not the partisan affiliations of elected officeholders. Hunger and housing insecurity need to start subsiding before the need for additional support to households is ruled out. As the year of lost learning for many American pupils starts to register in standardised-test results, a programme of tutoring to make up lost ground may be necessary. In reality, the rapidly constructed European-style safety-net is time-limited. Covid-19 has highlighted, again, how desirable it would be to for stimulus measures to kick in automatically when the economy is weak. The seven months of will-theywon't-they brinkmanship make the current approach suboptimal. But Congress has managed to pass a stimulus, while also showing how poverty might be reduced in future. That is something to cheer."

The Feds sue Walmart for prescribing opioids without due care
""The opioid epidemic is as bad as ever,"" says Caleb Alexander at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In a year when all eyes were on the death toll from covid-19, about 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses from June 2019 to May 2020, more than during any other 12-month period ever recorded, according to preliminary figures from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Both federal and state governments have been suing companies for their part in this. On December 22nd the Department of Justice (doj) added a high-profile suit against Walmart.
The doj accuses the world's biggest retailer, which also manages some 5,000 instore pharmacies, of fuelling the opioid epidemic by screening questionable prescriptions lackadaisically, despite repeated warnings from its own pharmacists. The suit was expected. Some counties have already sued other pharmacies. In October Walmart sued the doj pre-emptively, asking a federal court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacists under the Controlled Substances Act (csa), an unusual step that seemed to be primarily a publicrelations exercise.
In its complaint, filed at a court in Delaware, the doj alleges that Walmart violated the csa in various ways, as the operator both of pharmacies and of wholesale drugdistribution centres. Under pressure from their managers, Walmart pharmacists dispensed umpteen dodgy drug prescriptions, according to the suit. Managers denied pharmacists the authority to refuse prescriptions from suspect doctors, and told them to dispense prescriptions quickly because ""shorter wait times keep patients in store"". Walmart pharmacists continued to dispense prescriptions from suspected ""pill mills"", even when warned that other pharmacies were refusing them. And they ignored red flags, such as prescriptions for ""trinities""-drug cocktails that often include an opioid and a muscle relaxant.
The complaint also alleges that, as operator of distribution centres (Walmart ceased distributing controlled substances from such centres in 2018), the company received hundreds of thousands of suspicious orders, which it failed to report to the dea. Distributors are required to report orders unusual in size, pattern or frequency. Over an approximately four-year period, Walmart shipped an estimated 37.5m controlled-substance orders to its pharmacies, but reported only 204 suspicious orders to the dea. During the same period, McKesson, Walmart's back-up distributor, which shipped far fewer orders, reported more than 13,000 suspicious orders from Walmart pharmacies to the dea.
Walmart rejects the charges. The company says the suit is ""wrong on the law and riddled with factual inaccuracies, mischaracterisations and cherry-picked documents taken out of context"". Walmart points out that pharmacists are not doctors, so they should not second-guess prescriptions. Moreover, not dispensing a prescription also carries risks: they could harm a patient in need. State boards could investigate them or even take away their licence. And patients and doctors could sue.
The 160-page civil complaint from the doj reads like the so-called multidistrict litigation (mdl), says Andrew Pollis of the Case Western Reserve School of Law. More than 2,000 suits filed across the country by counties, cities and Native American tribes are co-ordinated by Dan Polster, a federal judge. The doj suit could be combined with the mdl, says Mr Pollis. Walmart has 60 days from the day the complaint was filed to respond. It could file a motion to dismiss the case, but the district court in Delaware is likely to reject such a motion."

NEW YORK
How many norms can Donald Trump break before he leaves office?
When America's founders included in the constitution the power to ""grant reprieves and pardons for crimes against the United States"", they sought to hand presidents a ""benign prerogative"" to show mercy to repentant law-breakers and ""restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth"", as Alexander Hamilton put it in Federalist 74; without such a tool, he fretted, ""justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel"". Opponents worried that it would tilt the nation towards ""vile and arbitrary aristocracy or monarchy"".
The anti-federalists, it seems, were right to be concerned. On December 22nd and 23rd President Donald Trump put his signature on nearly 50 eyebrow-raising pardons and commutations. The beneficiaries included his longtime confidant, Roger Stone; his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort; and several others prosecuted as part of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Others were Charles Kushner, Ivanka Trump's father-in-law, who spent two years in prison for witness-tampering and tax evasion; three former Republican members of Congress convicted of fraud and financial misdeeds; and military contractors responsible for killing unarmed civilians during the Iraq war.
Removing these figures from the naughty list sets the 45th president apart from his predecessors. In the eyes of Ben Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska, the pardons are ""rotten to the core"".
Article II, section 2, clause 1 of the constitution affords presidents latitude in granting clemency. The only limit noted in the text is a bar on pardons in the case of impeachments. Over the years courts have leant toward an expansive reading of the power: in 1866, the Supreme Court said pardons may be offered before an individual's conviction or even indictment, and no ruling has prohibited presidents from extending mercy to friends or family members.
But protocols and norms have guided the process. A body within the Department of Justice-the office of the pardon attorney-assists presidents in deciding to whom they should extend mercy. The pardon attorney assesses candidates according to criteria such as ""post-conviction conduct, character and reputation"", ""acceptance of responsibility, remorse and atonement"" and ""official recommendations and reports"" from federal prosecutors or judges. Yet Mr Trump has taken on the task largely by himself, bypassing the office for all but a few of his pardons.
Presidents have often employed the pardon power in line with Hamilton's hopes. George Washington pardoned the Whiskey rebels (spirits producers who rioted against a tax on their goods) in 1795. Abraham Lincoln pardoned many Confederates during the civil war to encourage them to give up their drive towards secession and chart a path for the union's reconstruction. Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon after he resigned the presidency and Jimmy Carter's pardon of Vietnam draftdodgers were in a similar mould: helping the nation heal after a period of trauma. Barack Obama commuted the sentences of more than 1,000 inmates serving time for mostly non-violent drug offences.
Mr Trump's pardons are different. In July Mr Stone received a commutation of his prison sentence for lying to Congress and obstructing the Russia investigation to protect Mr Trump; he got a full pardon on December 23rd. Mr Manafort, who at first co-operated with the Mueller investigation before lying to prosecutors, showed enough loyalty to attract Mr Trump's sympathy. George Papadopoulos, an early target of Mr Mueller's investigation, admitted his crimes and acknowledged to a judge that his lies to federal agents ""could have harmed our nation"". In justifying his pardons of these and other figures pursued by Mr Mueller, Mr Trump referred to the Russia investigation as a ""hoax"" and as the ""greatest witch hunt in American history"".
He offered a similarly thin rationale for coming to the rescue of four former contractors at Blackwater, a private security company founded by Erik Prince, the brother of Betsy Devos, Mr Trump's education secretary. The men had been found guilty of killing at least 14 Iraqis, including two children, in 2007. The indiscriminate shooting, grenade-throwing and sniper fire into Baghdad's crowded Nisour Square was dubbed the ""My Lai massacre of Iraq"" by fbi investigators. Mr Trump praised the quartet for their ""long history of service to the nation"", and noted support for their pardons by fringey Republican congressmen like Steve King and Louie Gohmert.
Mr Trump is hardly the only recent president to take liberties with the pardon power. George H. W. Bush pardoned six people involved in the Iran-contra scandal he had tolerated as Ronald Reagan's vice-president. Bill Clinton drew criticism across the political spectrum when he pardoned Marc Rich, a fugitive tax-evader who raised millions for the Democratic Party and whose wife contributed nearly $500,000 to Mr Clinton's presidential library. But no president comes close to Mr Trump's ratio of self-serving pardons to those issued in the interest of mercy or national welfare."

NEW YORK
A tri-state wrangle over tax revenues compounds New York's difficulties
According to a Manhattan Institute poll, more than half of high-earning New Yorkers are working entirely from home and 44% are considering leaving the city. Ned Lamont, Connecticut's governor, has said ""the old idea of the commuter going into New York City five days a week may be an idea that's behind us."" It does seem unlikely that the tens of thousands who commute from Mr Lamont's state will continue to do so, or indeed the 400,000 that commute to the Big Apple from New Jersey. The region's governors have worked well together to tackle the pandemic, but the cordialness may soon end over taxes.
When people from neighbouring New Jersey and Connecticut commute to New York to work for a New York-based employer, they must pay New York tax on the related earned income. Their home states usually offer a credit to those workers. Even those who work from home must pay New York taxes, according to the state's ""convenience of the employer"" rule-unless the employee is working outside New York by necessity. Taxpayers and neighbouring states are looking closely at this loophole, as a deadly epidemic probably counts.
On December 22nd Connecticut and New Jersey filed briefs to the Supreme Court to consider a case which challenges a state's ability to tax non-residents' income while they are working remotely. New Hampshire filed suit against Massachusetts in October over taxing New Hampshire residents who are working remotely. ""We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will hold that states do not have the constitutional authority to tax individuals who neither live nor work there,"" said Phil Murphy, New Jersey's governor. This could cost New York billions, says Scott Roberti of Ernst & Young, an accounting firm.
This is not the only threat to the city's finances. Firms have considered leaving the city before, but employees are now less resistant to moving, says Kathryn Wylde of Partnership for New York City, an industry group. ""They've been working remotely for ten months and they've adjusted to that idea."" Goldman Sachs is mulling moving its asset managers to Florida. Elliott Management plans to move its headquarters from midtown Manhattan to West Palm Beach. Blackstone, a private-equity firm, and Citadel, a hedge fund, are also opening offices in Florida, which has no state income tax.
Companies are also watching the progression of the Billionaire Mark to Market Tax Act, which would treat unrealised capital gains on billionaires' assets as taxable income. Andrew Cuomo, New York's Democratic governor, has said he would veto any soak-the-rich legislation, because it would drive out wealthy, mobile residents, though that would bring a fight with the party's progressive wing. It would not take too many moving trucks for the city to feel the loss in revenue, says Michael Hendrix, also of the Manhattan Institute. A 5% loss of New Yorkers making a mere six figures would result in an annual loss of $933m in revenue-roughly the amount allocated for the city's health department."

CHICAGO
Policies and the pandemic are adding to long-term demographic stagnation
For generations, demographers considered America a standout. Lots of immigration and relatively high fertility rates increased its population fasterand kept it more youthfulthan its rich-country peers. Americans within their borders were also exceptionally mobile. Over many generations they proved much readier than Europeans, for example, to flit between cities (or states) in search of a new job or lifestyle. That dynamism helped to produce a flexible labour force and lively economy.
Now the exception is waning. Several big states have lost their demographic oomph. In mid-December the us Census published new population estimates (to be used for comparison when official census data are released in 2021). For those keen on growth, they offer mostly grim reading. Californias population has stalled and may, for the first time, be declining. Illinois, which has shed over 250,000 residents in a decade, has shrunk for seven successive years. In the year to July, thus counting in little pandemic effect, New York endured more shrinkage than any state: it lost 126,000, or 0.65%, of its people.
Some states, mostly in the South, are growing fast, but not enough to lift the national rate. Overall, Americas population is barely inching up by historical standards. In the year to July it grew by 0.35% (or 1.2m) to 329m. No year since 1900 has seen such a miserly gain, though the year to next July could be slower still. Even in the dark days after the first world war, as the Spanish flu raged, growth was faster. William Frey of the Brookings Institution calculates expansion in the decade to July 2020 at just 6.6%. If his sums are right, that is the lowest decadal gain since 1790 (see chart).
Evidence has also piled up to show Americans becoming much less mobile. Mr Frey notes a smaller share of them moved house in the year to March than at any time since reliable figures were first gathered in 1947. Just 9.3% of the population moved, barely half the figure in the 1980s, part of a steady decline over decades. Many factors contribute to that, including the high cost of housing that makes it difficult for younger Americans to move.
Kyle Mangum of the Federal Reserve in Philadelphia published a paper early in 2020 analysing why people move less frequently than their parents did, saying many factorsespecially the absence of new, fast-growing cities and more similarity between various labour marketsmean that this nation of pioneers has parked its wagons. He also notes how technology, such as air-conditioning, previously did much to open up territory for settlement. More recent technology, notably the internet, may instead have made it less necessary to move to find work.
Various changes reinforce each other. Less immigration, for example, has several effects. The just-concluding decade will see the smallest expansion of the foreignborn population in any decade since the 1970s. Far fewer immigrants are flowing to big cities such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, helping to explain why they are not growing. Lower immigration hits domestic mobility, because recent immigrants are among the readiest to move for work. It may also bring down fertility rates. The average American woman is now expected to have 1.7 children in her lifetime, the lowest level in decades. Thats below Frances rate (at 1.9), on par with Britains, and only slightly ahead of Canadas (1.5).
The result is more demographic stagnation. Mr Mangum sees a long-term reversion to the mean as America becomes less of an exception among rich countries. More recent influences accentuate that. The policies of Donald Trump sharply cut inflows of migrants. Joe Bidens administration will reverse some of these but probably not all, or at least not quickly.
The pandemic has its own effects. Two academics at ucBerkeley, Joshua Goldstein and Ronald Lee, suggest deaths from covid-19, which may exceed 500,000 by April, will cut average life expectancy by more than one year. The pandemic and the economic slump are also causing a baby bust. Two researchers, Melissa Kearney at University of Maryland and Phillip Levine at Wellesley College, estimate there will be 300,000 fewer births than otherwise expected in 2021 (there were 3.7m in 2019).
Post-pandemic, some of this could be reversed. Those putting off having children may cause a brief baby boom in 2022 or 2023. Eventual reopening of borders should see immigration tick up again. Even so, slower population growth will continue in the coming years says Joseph Chamie, a demographer in Oregon, because America is looking more and more like Europe, with lower fertility, more measured levels of migration.
Does that matter? For individual states having fewer people undoubtedly hurts. Several Midwestern and north-eastern states, for example, will lose political clout as congressional and electoral-college seats go in reapportionment in 2021. It also matters for state finances if there are fewer taxpayers to pay for public services.
But for the country as a whole Mr Chamie doubts that bigger is always better. He rejects a pro-growth dogma, in which it is assumed that having more consumers, workers and taxpayers makes sense. He wants a debate on what is desirable, noting the environmental costs of a bigger population. The us Census set out scenarios for the forecast population in 2060. Were the country to return to being an exceptional place, open to high levels of immigration, its population could reach 447m. As a more normal rich country, less welcoming to immigrants, it could shrink to 320m."

About the only light note of a grim Christmas season on Capitol Hill was provided, characteristically, by Lamar Alexander. At the end of a gruelling negotiation of the $900bn stimulus that President Donald Trump belatedly signed this week, the 80-yearold Tennesseean, who will retire from the Senate in January, took to a piano in the Hart building to play carols.
Bipartisan admirers of Mr Alexander, one of the last reliable dealmakers on the Hill, gathered round. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota swayed to the performance while Susan Collins of Maine filmed it on her phone. Tim Kaine of Virginia joined his fellow former governor on the harmonica for a rendition of ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"". Billing themselves as ""The Amateurs"", the two senators once played together at a music festival on the Tennessee-Virginia border. Theirs was a rare bipartisan act in what has been by some length the most unproductive Congress ever. ""I'm really going to miss both his friendship and leadership,"" said Mr Kaine of his departing co-performer.
The regard for Mr Alexander on the leftis not for his moderation, exactly. As he underlined during an interview in his Senate office-amid a clutter of packing-cases and ancient campaign souvenirs-he is fiercely partisan on most issues. He has an a rating from the National Rifle Association and a mediocre one for bipartisanship from the Lugar Centre. He has also capitulated to Mr Trump. Despite speculation last year that he might join Mitt Romney in voting to convict the impeached president, Mr Alexander ended up voting to bar witnesses from his trial. There would be no point, he said, because the charges levelled at the president had been proved. He voted to acquit him anyway.
Yet, unlike many in his party, Mr Alexander hews to the traditional view of the Senate as above all a place to pass laws. And as a former education secretary and two-term governor, he knows how to do so, including by compromising. He has thereby maintained influence both within his party and across the aisle, a rare balancing-act, which has made him unusually effective.
Mitch McConnell, a lifelong friend, choked back tears in praising Mr Alexander as ""one of the most brilliant, most thoughtful and most effective legislators any of us have ever seen."" Thus, for example, when he rallied 99 senators behind a package of measures against the opioid crisis in 2018. Or when he united Paul Ryan, Mr McConnell and Barack Obama behind a sweeping education reform in 2015-for which Mr Alexander still praises the former president: ""I found him to be a very straightforward, well-informed and effective partner."" It is harder to imagine a genuine moderate Republican such as Ms Collins, or one less trusted by the party leadership, such as Mr Romney, pulling offsuch feats. Discouragingly for those who hope Joe Biden's return-to-sanity candidacy might ease the Senate's deadlock, however, the rarity of Mr Alexander's performance also suggests how hard that will be.
The retiring senator attributes much of the dysfunction to technological change: ""We live in this new internet democracy which pushes everything to the extreme."" But that underplays the structural changes the Senate is undergoing. Following a path trodden by the House of Representatives, the ideological gap between its most left-leaning Republican and most moderate Democrat is growing. And most senators have little incentive to try to bridge it. Hotheads in both parties will brand compromise with the other side as surrender: the president has himself denounced most of the few bipartisan bills he has signed. Oscillating control of the Senate-as illustrated by the all-American drama of Georgia's looming run-offs-has given a method to that madness. With control of the chamber at stake, the opposition party is rarely willing to help the governing one succeed. The bipartisan stimulus deals, forged amid calamity, shows what it takes to buck this trend. ""The political rewards for working in the middle are diminished,"" Mr Alexander acknowledged.
The extent to which he has carried on regardless is impressive. Beyond his abilities, it probably owes something to the political tradition of his eastern Tennessee stronghold. A redoubt of ""mountain Republicanism"", a strain of Appalachian populism, its voters have long been relaxed about the government-expanding compromises Mr Alexander has sometimes made. Yet not even he could survive the past four years unscathed.
By his own admission, he has not come close to tackling any big national issue-such as immigration or health-care policy-under Mr Trump. The president's relentless warring has made the necessary compromises impossible. This has in turn made Mr Alexander's balancing-act between the parties untenable. He is too independent-minded to be trusted by the Trump party. Meanwhile, notwithstanding their old regard for Mr Alexander, Democrats are now likelier to raise his strained apologism for the president than his dealmaking.
Marring Lamar
He gave Lexington a taste of that contortion, by responding angrily to a question about his party's commitment to electoral democracy. Though he acknowledged that almost two-thirds of Republican House members and state attorneys-general had bent to the president's demand and signed a motion to invalidate the results in the four battleground states that gave Mr Biden victory, Mr Alexander considered the question not merely provocative but offensive. He suggested, implausibly, that the failure of the Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, to concede a gubernatorial race in Georgia two years ago was no less a threat to American democracy.
Your columnist did not enjoy that exchange; but found it revealing. A survivor from a better age, Mr Alexander has found a space to operate between the two parties that few could. Yet not even he can negotiate the current madness. The result is a lesson for Mr Biden. And an unworthy end to a fine career."

MEXICO CITY
A new law might hobble the us-Mexican fight against drug cartels
Mexico can be relieved to finish the Trump era in one piece. Swingeing tariffs and border closures, ever threatened, never came. Nor did the bill for a wall on America's southern border which Donald Trump promised to build at Mexico's expense. The president's attack on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Canada, catalysed advocates of trade and integration. One could almost conclude that Mr Trump will leave relations between the two countries sturdier than he found them.
But the Trump show always has a twist. On October 15th Salvador Cienfuegos, Mexico's defence minister from 2012 to 2018, was arrested in California on drug-trafficking charges, which he denies. Mexico was furious to learn that the United States had investigated him in secret for years.
On November 18th, in a shocking reversal, the United States dropped the charges against Mr Cienfuegos, who returned swiftly to Mexico. Court documents cite ""sensitive and important foreign policy considerations"", implying that Mexico threatened to halt cross-border security cooperation if Mr Cienfuegos did not go free. Prosecutors in the United States cannot recall any other occasion where a foreign government has appeared to snatch its own citizen from the jaws of America's criminal-justice system so brazenly.
The episode, described by one American official as ""a total shitshow"", has complicated the Mexican-American relationship just as it had at last seemed to be getting simpler. The lack of trust shown by the United States has awoken anti-yanqui sentiment among left-wing supporters of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's populist president. The backlash was sharp: by December 15th Mexican legislators had rushed through a law that wraps red tape round foreign agents on Mexican soil, complicating American anti-narcotics work. It serves as a warning to Joe Biden that no love-in awaits when he assumes the presidency later this month.
In fact, Mr López Obrador, known as amlo, seems sad to see Mr Trump go. He has spent two years schmoozing his counterpart. As president-elect, Mr López Obrador, a keen writer, sent a letter to Mr Trump observing that they had both risen to ""displace the political establishment"". Although relations under Mr Trump were always one tweet away from a crisis, Mexico kept calm. amlo sent troops to patrol the border, publicly praised Mr Trump and waited six weeks to congratulate Mr Biden.
For all that, amlo could not abide the arrest of Mr Cienfuegos. ""Do you think Canada, France or Great Britain would be ok if the Americans detained their defence secretary without telling them?"" wonders a Mexican official. But sovereignty is not the only concern. A foreign trial of Mr Cienfuegos might have unearthed various scandals. A stain on Mexico's army would cast doubt on the wisdom of amlo's strategy to put it in charge of new infrastructure.
The case against Mr Cienfuegos was ini- tiated not by Mr Trump but by prosecutors in New York's Eastern District (edny). In a letter to a federal judge, they explained that the investigation was built around a wiretap of Mr Cienfuego's Blackberry, in which he allegedly conspired with leaders of h-2, a lesser-known Mexican cartel.
The prosecutors who would have tried the case-had charges not been dropped- have become familiar with Mexico's underworld over the past decade, applying tricks they honed against the Italian mob. In 2019 they secured the conviction of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, a drug lord who was extradited after twice escaping from his Mexican prison cell. The same year they charged Genaro García Luna, Mexico's security minister in 2006-12, with accepting bribes from El Chapo's Sinaloa cartel (amlo has also asked the United States to extradite Mr García Luna back to Mexico, where charges await). The district has no plans to stop chasing big fish abroad; the cases are as prestigious as they are consequential.
But such cases rely on precisely the kind of evidence that will be tougher to gather under Mexico's new national-security law. It requires foreign agents to share all information gleaned from activities on Mexican soil with the authorities there. All Mexican officials who speak to agents must file written reports. And agents themselves have no immunity if Mexico deems them to have overstepped their bounds.
Cases painstakingly built against past kingpins would have been severely hampered had this law existed at the time, says one of the edny prosecutors in the El Chapo case: to share intelligence on a cartel from a confidential source is to risk that source's life. Mexican officials scoff at the notion that the United States deems their government trustworthy enough to receive weapons, but not information.
The security relationship is at a critical juncture. American agents will have to choose between violating Mexico's trust by ignoring the law and conducting feebler investigations from American soil. Cartels are trafficking ever deadlier drugs, such as fentanyl, to American consumers. Mexico is on track to notch up a record murder rate for the fourth year running. The United States has allocated $3.ibn since 2007 to improve Mexican law enforcement, but amlo has stopped spending those funds and wants them redirected to ""development"" of Mexico's poorest states.
Though erratic and obsessed with migration and trade, Mr Trump was incurious about Mexico. Benign neglect suited amlo. A Biden administration will act methodically and show more interest. Mexican officials fear future tiffs over labour rules, human rights and the environment. Even if Mr Biden is able to put crime-fighting collaboration on a stable footing, the postTrump era will not be easy. *"

A beloved condiment runs out
There is one bottle of China Lily soy sauce left in Vilma Portillo's kitchen and she is measuring it out-drop by drop. ""We know we have to ration it so we're only using very small amounts, like one drop at a time,"" says Ms Portillo. ""We're about two fingers into our last bottle."" The last time there was a China Lily soy-sauce drought in northern British Columbia, in 2018, Ms Portillo's husband, Cody Malbeuf, stopped eating rice for three months. He vowed never again to be caught short.
The sauce, made by Lee's Food Products, a company in Ontario, has been a household staple in northern British Columbia for six decades. Mr Malbeuf is so besotted with the brand that he remembers the first time he saw a bottle of it when he was 11 years old at his aunt's dinner table. He can measure how stressful his day has been by how much he douses his food in the sauce.
The shortage of China Lily turned into panic for Mr Malbeuf and others in late November when no bottles could be found on shelves in Prince George and nearby towns. Before Christmas, online advertisements prompted offers of ten times the normal asking price of C$3 ($2.35) to C$4.
One man auctioned off a supply of China Lily to his aunt, who planned to redistribute them as Christmas presents. On eBay, a pair of bottles can be found for C$50. When one of the grocery stores managed to bring in a shipment, Mr Malbeuf saw a photo of his beloved condiment on social media and demanded that his wife leave work to rush to the shop with him. Customers in the long queue were limited to one precious bottle each.
China Lily is viewed with particular affection among the province's indigenous households. It is used liberally in indigenous fried bread, known as bannock, and with salmon. Shirley Nehass of the Tahltan Nation says she grew up with China Lily because it was the only kind of soy sauce anyone had ever seen.
To Ms Nehass, China Lily was the seasoning for every dish. Lise Luppens, who worked as a dietician in northern British Columbia, notes that many indigenous people include China Lily as a ""traditional food"" among dishes such as chow mein and curried bologna.
The sauce's taste is distinctive, if not authentic. China Lily is noticeably sweet, thanks to the addition of sugar and caramel flavouring. Brian Chang, the owner of an Asian grocery store, says that although he carries 15 other types of soy sauce from Thailand, the Philippines, China and Japan, these are less popular than China Lily. ""A lot of people up north like things sweet,"" says Mr Chang. ""Other soy sauces are not sweet and when they try other soy sauce it doesn't taste the way they expect it to.""
In late November a rumour circulated that Lee's Foods had shut down. That is untrue, says Colleen Levitt, who works at the company. She points out that demand is higher because people crave comfort food during a pandemic. ""We're making it as fast as we can,"" she adds.
Mr Chang's last shipment arrived two weeks ago and was sold out in a day of panic-buying. Since then, he has fielded about six calls a day from anxious customers eager for their next fix. He expects more black-market peddling of the sweet and salty sauce. Christopher Wong, president of Lee's Foods, and the founder's grandson, is grateful for his niche in British Columbia's food chain. ""Loyalty on that scale is unheard of in this day and age,"" he says. *"

SANTIAGO
Chilean wines are prospering in China, thanks to savvy packaging
In thirty years Chile's wine industry has gone from backwater to global powerhouse. Its vineyards are blessed with few pests, warm summers and low costs. That has helped it become the world's largest non-European wine exporter by volume. Now it is taking China by storm; only Australia and France send more wine there.
The absence of tariffs helps. Since Chile signed a trade deal with China in 2006, the value of its wine exports to that country has rocketed from $5m to $250m in 2019. Another factor is Chile's ability to make wine that is specially branded and packaged for the Chinese market, known in the trade as ""private-label"" wine. This requires not only good plonk, but also impeccable labelling and bottling: the drink is often given as a gift, so it has to look impressive. Chilean wine sent to China fetches an average of $33.11 a case, a price that includes all costs up to loading it onto a ship, compared with $27.42 for wine sent to the United States.
""The key to success in China is to understand the market and...cultural context,"" says Nathalie Malbrán, who oversees Asia for Viña Futaleufú, a winery that specialises in private labelling. Founded in 2012, it now leads Chile's wine exports to China, ahead of dominant brands Concha y Toro and Montes. China's size and diversity mean there is no common pattern for bottles and labels. ""It is essential to be flexible,"" says Ms Malbrán.
This business model has fostered a flourishing label-design sector in Chile to cater for China's changing requirements. It is a huge challenge, says Carlos Scheuch of Colorama, a label-maker, not least because the labels must withstand rough weather and extreme temperatures on the monthlong journey across the Pacific to China, then overland to the retailers.
""The label designs are spectacular,"" he says. They involve different textures, unusual shapes and advanced printing techniques such as embossing, silk-screen printing and coloured metallic foils. Gold and silver are favoured colours. Whereas chateaux often appear on French bottles, Chilean private-label ones favour landscapes, animals, birds and images that emphasise their Chilean character. Designs are rarely repeated, so printers have adjusted to one-off print-runs. ""Eighty per cent are printed only once and never again,"" says Mr Scheuch.
The wine's name is noticed as much as the design. The ideal is to retain some meaning when transliterated or written phonetically in Chinese, says Jaime Muñoz, who founded Antawara Wines in 2006 to enter the Chinese market. The transliteration may be Chinese for an auspicious number or a hopeful omen, he says.
Viña Futaleufú, for instance, trades in Asia under the simpler name Anun Wines. The two Chinese characters for Anun (an and neng), which means ""putting down roots"" in Mapudungun, the language of Chile's Mapuche people, can be interpreted as ""safe"" and ""capable"". Anun also markets a brand called Ahu, a ceremonial platform for the moai stone carvings on Rapa Nui (Easter Island), a Chilean territory. A gold moai head stands out on the black label.
Six out of Chile's top ten wine exporters to China use private labels, says Ms Malbrán. This is paying off. In 2016 China became Chile's main wine destination by value, though in 2020 it slipped behind Brazil and Britain by volume after covid-19 left stocks languishing in Chinese warehouses. Chile's industry insiders reckon that time, and vaccines, will restore the Asian giant to its perch."

BUENOS AIRES
Argentina rolls out a Russian vaccine with fanfare and haste
At their dinner table in Mendoza, Antonio and Marta, husband and wife, disagreed over the Russian vaccine Sputnik V. ""If it's available, and free, why not?"" asked Antonio, a sprightly businessman in his early 70s. ""Not for me,"" retorted Marta, a decade younger. ""No way I think the Russians have the safe answer to this virus.""
On December 29th Argentina's government unleashed Sputnik V across the country, issuing some 300,000 doses to all 23 provinces and the city of Buenos Aires. Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico, Chile, and Costa Rica had been vaccinating on a small scale before the holiday with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. But Argentina, to quote a presidential adviser, ""is leading the charge to inoculate all"".
Still, the cavalry has been met with doubts. Alberto Fernández, Argentina's 61year-old president, broke his promise to be the country's first recipient, live on television, after Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who is 68, said he would put off his jab because of his age. Then Mr Fernández's government sidestepped the normal procedures of its medical regulatory agency, anmat, in authorising Sputnik V.
On the eve of the vaccine's launch, anmat specialists leaked internal memos to the Argentine media, expressing concerns about ""adverse effects"" of Sputnik V on older patients in trials in Russia. Warnings of ""symptoms like influenza"" got front-page headlines, though these are common with many vaccines.
Unsurprisingly, Sputnik V has become a political football. Alfredo Cornejo, leader of the Radical party, alleged corruption, suggesting that officials' demands for bribes had scuppered deals with other producers in Europe and the United States.
Geopolitics played a role, too. The decision was ""ideological"", says the presidential adviser, pointing to the role of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a former president who now serves as a powerful vice-president. Ms Fernández, who wants Russia and China to counterbalance American influence in the region, opened a back-channel to Mr Putin in November. (She also supported his annexation of Crimea in 2014.)
As the government delivered Sputnik V to health-care staff and the very old, broadcasting films of vaccinations, doctors expressed quiet dismay about the politics. ""But the very idea of a vaccine being available could calm things down,"" said a doctor in the capital, noting a spike in covid-19.
Sputnik V has a chequered history in Russia, where it bypassed the usual safety and efficacy trials for authorising the drug before use. New randomised trials are now belatedly under way in Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and India, so the vaccine may yet be redeemed. But Argentina's decision to evade regulators and make political hay out of vaccinations has eroded confidence in the jab.
This could cost lives. Antonio has since agreed with his wife that Sputnik V is not for him: ""I've too many doubts about this now."" Other countries tempted to play politics with vaccines should pay heed. Drug approval is best left to the experts. *"

Ethiopia says the conflict in Tigray is an exclusively internal matter. It is not
ADDIS ABABA
First come muffled sobs, gradually growing louder with each new voice that joins the chorus. A woman in a black shawl begins to wail, her body rocking towards the portrait of a smiling young man in the middle of the room. Abraham was 35 years old when he was shot, says an older brother who is hosting mourning relatives on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Last month armed men arrived at the family home in Adwa, a town in the northern region of Tigray. By then many of the town's residents had fled, but not Abraham, who had a young child and a sick, ageing father. When the gunmen tried to steal two of the family's trucks, Abraham resisted. He was shot dead on the spot, in front of his father.
According to his family, Abraham's killers were from Eritrea, a neighbouring country whose troops have been fighting alongside Ethiopian government forces against the recently-ousted rulers of Tigray. There is little reason to doubt their claim. Although phone lines to Adwa have been cut since the fighting started in early November, they know what happened to Abraham from a family friend who met his father, as well as neighbours who escaped to Mekelle, the regional capital.
Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's prime minister, has consistently denied enlisting the help of soldiers from Eritrea, the gulag state next door. But Abiy's denials ring hollow in the face of a growing number of claims like those of Abraham's family, as well as by foreign diplomats and governments. In December America said reports of Eritrea's involvement were ""credible"" and urged it to withdraw. Belgian journalists who made a rare trip into Tigray found video footage apparently showing an Eritrean tank loaded with plunder.
Exposing Eritrea's involvement matters because both governments have gone to such lengths to deny it. Abiy told António Guterres, the secretary-general of the un, that no Eritrean soldiers had entered Ethiopia. His government says Tigray's now-renegade ruling party, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (tplf), made fake Eritrean uniforms to spread misinformation. Eritrea's foreign minister told Reuters that Eritrea was not a party to the conflict.
Others say that Eritrea's involvement is not only real but highly significant. It won independence from Ethiopia in 1993. The two countries fought a bloody border war in the late 1990s followed by two decades of low-level conflict that ended with a peace deal in 2018 (for which Abiy won the Nobel peace prize in 2019). Much of the fighting was along Tigray's border, leading to bitter enmity between Eritreans and the tplf.
This bitterness may explain the destruction that Eritrean forces have left in their wake. They are accused of killing civilians, looting, laying waste to farmland and abducting some of the 100,000 Eritrean refugees who had fled their own totalitarian government and sought safety in camps in Tigray.
Using foreign troops to fight a war on his own soil besmirches Abiy's reputation and will complicate efforts to pacify Tigray. ""The government will never admit it,"" says an Ethiopian analyst. ""Because they know they could never justify it to the Tigrayans.""
Awet Tewelde Weldemichael, an Eritrean academic at Queen's University in Canada, says that in recent weeks there seems to have been a phased withdrawal of Eritrean troops. If true, it might suggest Abiy has had enough of them. Or it might mean that Issaias Afwerki, Eritrea's dictator, is confident that his old foes in the tplf have been routed. Although fighting is reported to be continuing in several parts of Tigray, the tplf leadership-thought to be holed up somewhere in the mountains-has been mostly silent for weeks. On December 18th the Ethiopian government offered a reward worth the equivalent of $260,000 for information on their whereabouts.
It is not just Eritrea that has a stake in Ethiopia's civil war. Clashes between Sudanese forces and militias from Amhara, a region to the south of Tigray, have turned deadly in recent weeks. They are fighting over a large slice of fertile farmland that is within Sudan's borders but long occupied by Amhara farmers. Shortly after the war began in Tigray, Sudanese troops moved into positions that had previously been held by the Ethiopian army. Since then each side has accused the other of upping the ante. On December 22nd Ethiopia's deputy prime minister accused Sudanese forces of looting. Sudan's information minister countered by accusing the Ethiopian army of taking part in border attacks. Talks and a visit to Addis Ababa in December by Abdalla Hamdok, Sudan's prime minister, have failed to resolve the matter.
These tensions are unlikely to blow up into a full-scale war between the two states. But if the border conflict is not solved, could prolong the fighting in Tigray by, for instance, turning a blind eye to arms and other supplies crossing the border. That would be a headache for Abiy, whose forces are already overstretched trying to locate the tplf's guerrilla forces while also battling armed insurgents and quelling inter-ethnic fighting elsewhere in the country.
On December 23rd more than 200 civilians, mostly Amharas, were massacred by heavily armed ethnic militiamen in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. Similar incidents have been reported in western Oromia in recent weeks. Ethnic Somalis and Afars in the country's east are also trading deadly blows. Ethiopia, already a tinder box, risks igniting a wider conflagration across the Horn of Africa."

KAMPALA
The government is trying to crush the opposition ahead of elections
Opposition candidates are arrested, crowds dispersed with tear-gas and bullets, campaign meetings in the capital banned. A leading human-rights lawyer is behind bars. The state kills scores of protesters and attacks journalists. And on January 14th Ugandans will vote for a president.
Authoritarian habits are ingrained in the institutions of the Ugandan state. Even so, this election will probably be the most violent since Yoweri Museveni fought his way to power in 1986. His regime is rattled by an opposition candidate, Bobi Wine, a pop star and politician who has become an avatar of youthful discontent.
Mr Museveni is one of Africa's longestserving presidents (see chart). Yet the 76year-old has no intention of retiring-or of being beaten in a fair race. Uganda's electoral commission has limited crowds at rallies to 200 people because of covid-19. On December 26th it banned any campaign meetings in the capital, Kampala, and in 15 districts for health reasons. This is bad for Mr Wine, as his message, like the virus, spreads fastest in crowded urban centres.
In March he sang that people should ""keep a social distance"". Now he addresses crowds of fans, who have become blasé about the disease. Uganda, with the second-youngest population in the world, has registered just 250 covid-19 deaths. Mr Wine is more worried about bullets, like the one that police fired through his windscreen in the eastern city of Jinja. On December 27th, he says, an army truck struck and killed one of his bodyguards; the army says he fell from a car. The next day another opposition candidate, Patrick Oboi Amuriat, was pepper-sprayed by a policeman.
The worst violence was back in November, when Mr Wine was briefly detained for violating covid-19 guidelines. Unruly protests broke out in several towns. Police, soldiers and plainclothes gunmen shot dead at least 54 people; more than a thousand were arrested. Mr Museveni later said that it was legitimate to fire at stone-throwing civilians, even if, on his own count, only 32 of those killed were actually ""rioters"". He has since put a son back in charge of Special Forces Command, a feared army unit, in a sign that the hardliners are on top.
Meanwhile journalists following Mr Wine have been tear-gassed, beaten and targeted with rubber bullets. Ali Mivule, a cameraman, says a police commander shouted ""collateral damage"" before firing a tear-gas canister at his leg on December 27th. Ashraf Kasirye, another cameraman on the scene, was shot in the head and rushed to hospital. He works for Ghetto tv, one of several online outlets that back Mr Wine; the communications regulator has asked Google, so far in vain, to block these channels' YouTube accounts. A team from Canada's cbc has been kicked out of the country. Foreign journalists have been stopped from entering at the airport or stymied by ever-changing accreditation rules.
Local ngos are under threat, too. In October authorities shut down National Election Watch Uganda, a coalition of groups planning to observe the elections. The bank accounts of two of its members were frozen for ""financing terrorism"". On December 22nd gunmen burst into a restaurant where Nicholas Opiyo, a leading human-rights lawyer, was meeting three colleagues and one of Mr Wine's campaigners. They were handcuffed, blindfolded and driven away. Mr Opiyo is still being held, charged with money-laundering. Escalating repression may test relationships with Western governments. An American official says the ""shrinking of political space"" could have ""negative ramifications"" for future aid and security assistance.
""In previous elections we would see violence either a few days before the polling date or after,"" says Crispin Kaheru, an activist. ""This time the violence came early."" The opposition is bound to accuse Mr Museveni of fiddling the vote count. But he may not need to, since he has made it so hard for his opponents to compete at all."

If Loujain al-Hathloul is guilty of trying to harm national security and advance a foreign agenda, as a Saudi court found on December 28th, then what about Muhammad bin Salman? For Ms Hathloul merely campaigned to end the ban on woman drivers in Saudi Arabia. Prince Muhammad, its de facto ruler, actually lifted the ban in 2018, not long after Ms Hathloul was detained.
The kingdom denies that Ms Hathloul was arrested just for her driving campaign, which included an attempt in 2014 to motor from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia (leading to an earlier stint in prison). Rather, her offence was trying to undermine the royal family by, among other things, speaking to international human-rights groups and foreign journalists. The original charge sheet noted, absurdly, that she mentioned her arrest in her cover letter when applying for a job at the un and that she had also spoken to European diplomats. In the end she was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison.
The court suspended much of that sentence, and backdated the start of her jail term, so Ms Hathloul will serve only three more months. But, according to her family, she has already suffered immensely. In 2018 she was kidnapped by Emirati security forces in Abu Dhabi, where she was studying, and taken back to Saudi Arabia, where she was later arrested along with other activists. She was tortured, says her sister.
Prince Muhammad styles himself a reformer who empowers Saudi women. But he gets annoyed when his subjects demand rights. He is as prickly as he is ruthless-and also rather inept. Ms Hathloul was a prominent activist before her latest arrest; now she is even more famous, a cause célébre in the West. Prince Muhammad's lifting of the driving ban and other reforms have largely been overshadowed by his repression.
In this case, at least, foreign outrage may have swayed the prince. The kingdom seems to have waited to sentence Ms Hathloul until after it finished hosting the G20 summit. It dropped the charges relating to her contact with European embassies. And her release will come soon after Donald Trump, an enabler of autocrats, leaves the White House. Joe Biden, the president-elect, has promised to reassess America's relationship with the cruel kingdom."

JERUSALEM
Israel will hold yet another election. This time Binyamin Netanyahu faces a challenge from the right
For 15 years Binyamin Netanyahu has been the undisputed leader of the Israeli right. In 2009 he guided his nationalist Likud party to power, becoming prime minister. He has held the office ever since. Challengers from the centre and left have tried mightily, and failed, to unseat him. They pose little threat as Israel gears up for an election on March 23rd. Now, though, Mr Netanyahu (pictured, left) faces a challenge from former allies on the right.
The election was triggered by the failure of the Knesset (Israel's parliament) to pass a budget by a deadline on December 23rd. Mr Netanyahu had ordered the finance minister, a member of Likud, to take his time preparing the budget. This was a political move-an effort to time the government's collapse for when the polls looked best for the prime minister. But enough mps were fed up with his manoeuvring that they were able to block any more delays.
It will be Israel's fourth election in two years. The previous three ended in draws. The stalemate was broken only when Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist Blue and White party, agreed to share power with Mr Netanyahu. Mr Gantz was to take over as prime minister in November 2021, though many Israelis doubted that Mr Netanyahu would honour the deal, which is now dead. Both leaders urged their members to vote for extending the budget deadline and preserving the coalition, largely because they fear the electoral threat posed by Gideon Sa'ar (pictured, right).
Mr Sa'ar resigned from the Knesset and left Likud in December. The former education minister had previously challenged Mr Netanyahu for the party's leadership, and lost badly. Now he has his own party, New Hope, which is drawing other Likud defectors. The urbane lawyer, a dj in his spare time, is at home in the liberal circles of Tel Aviv. But make no mistake, he is a man of the right. He backs West Bank settlements and wants to reform a judicial system perceived by some as having a liberal bias. On ideology he hardly differs from Mr Netanyahu, whom he once served as cabinet secretary.
Mr Sa'ar rails, however, against the ""cult of personality"" that Likud has fostered around the prime minister. The party, he says, has become ""a tool"" to serve Mr Netanyahu's interests, ""including those related to his criminal trial"". Mr Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust stemming from three corruption cases. Replacing him is ""the order of the hour"", says Mr Sa'ar, who also supports limiting the tenure of prime ministers to eight years (Mr Netanyahu has served for 11 years straight and 14 in total). New Hope has soared in the polls.
Two other parties led by erstwhile allies of the prime minister-Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman, both former defence ministers-are expected to do well. Mr Sa'ar will probably cut into their support, but together they may draw enough nationalist and religious voters, Mr Netan- yahu's base, to deny him the share he needs to stay in power. Israel's centrist and leftwing parties would probably join a coalition led by Mr Sa'ar if it meant getting rid of Mr Netanyahu.
The centrist and left-wing parties stand little chance on their own. Labour, the party of the state's Zionist-Socialist founders, will be lucky to win a handful of seats. Mr Gantz, meanwhile, largely discredited himself by joining Mr Netanyahu in government after promising voters he would not. The centrist ex-general claimed he had to so that the country could fight covid-19. But most voters think he was outwitted by the prime minister.
Mr Netanyahu, for his part, hopes at last to gain a majority that may grant him immunity from prosecution. His popularity has plummeted thanks to his government's shoddy handling of covid-19 and its effect on the economy; polls show him and his allies falling short of a majority. But they also show Mr Sa'ar with a difficult path to forming a government without Likud. ""Under no scenario will I join a government led by [Mr Netanyahu],"" says Mr Sa'ar.
Is more stalemate in the offing? On December 27th Israel became the first country in the world to enter a third nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of covid-19. But 500,000 Israelis, 6% of the population, have already received the first dose of the vaccine. Israel is moving faster than most of the world. Mr Netanyahu, who on December 19th became the first Israeli to get the jab, is hoping the vaccination drive will also give his campaign a shot in the arm."

CAIRO
A sick president returns to an ailing country
Little is known about Abdelmadjid Tebboune's bout with covid-19. For nearly two months beginning in October, Algeria's 75-year-old president, a heavy smoker, disappeared from public view after travelling to Germany for treatment. On December 13th, amid swirling rumours about his health, Mr Tebboune's men posted a proof of life: a five-minute video in which the visibly thinner president pledged to come home soon. At last, on December 29th, he did return, looking as if he had regained the weight. Mr Tebboune is ""nearing complete healing"", state media reported, citing a brief statement from the president.
For a man trying to turn the page on the autocratic presidency of his predecessor, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the omens are not good. The government also concealed the poor health of Mr Bouteflika, a wheelchairbound octogenarian who suffered at least one stroke while in office. Mass protests toppled him in 2019, but they did not dislodge the old elite. Later that year Mr Tebboune (pictured) was elected in a poll contested by only a handful of regime insiders and shunned by most Algerians. The hirak, the country's leaderless protest movement, boycotted the vote.
The protesters saw the election as an effort to silence them while changing little. They insist on removing the generals, businessmen and politicians who have long ruled from behind the scenes and siphoned the country's hydrocarbon wealth. Mr Tebboune, a former prime minister, was widely viewed as the choice of Ahmed Gaid Salah, the army chief. Two weeks after Mr Tebboune's election, in December 2019, the general suffered a fatal heart attack.
So Mr Tebboune tried to shore up his legitimacy with a constitutional referendum. In November Algerians approved amendments that reinstated presidential term limits and granted new powers to the executive and to parliament. But the turnout (23%) was the lowest in any poll since the country's independence from France in 1962. The changes did little to assuage the hirak. Protests, suspended in March as covid-19 spread, are likely to resume once the state's public-health restrictions are lifted. ""When life returns to normal there will be a lot of Algerians heading back to the streets,"" says Samir Belarabi, an activist.
Critics of the government have good reason to doubt Mr Tebboune's promise of a ""new Algeria"". The constitution pays lipservice to freedom of speech, but the number of political prisoners is rising, say activists. In December prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Walid Kechida, who started a Facebook group featuring pro-hirak memes. Government censors have banned a growing number of websites. A new law will increase state control over online media by requiring news sites to obtain a licence and be hosted inside the country. Journalists say the government has not been this repressive since the 1990s, when dozens of them were murdered during a bloody civil war.
Yet the biggest threat faced by Mr Tebboune is the crumbling economy. A covidinduced plunge in the global demand for oil has caused Algeria's revenue from it to fall by a third. In response, the government halved its budget. It has so far not cut the subsidies that make food, housing and fuel cheap, but that may be unavoidable. Foreign reserves have fallen from nearly $200bn in 2014 to about $44bn. Algeria's dinar lost about 20% against the euro in 2020. unesco has declared the currency a heritage object at risk of disappearing, quipped a satirical news site.
The government's only plan appears to be to hope for oil prices to rise. Mr Tebboune has pledged not to accept an imf programme, in keeping with the government's long-held fear of foreign interference. But an increasing number of Algerians are seeking salvation overseas. In the first nine months of 2020, 50% more of them crossed the water to Spain compared with all of 2019, according to unhcr. Winter usually means fewer crossings. But in 2021 many more are likely to risk them."

TOKYO
Suga Yoshihide is dragging the bureaucracy into the digital era
Hirai takuya keeps a tablet computer propped on his desk and an Apple Watch on his wrist. It is an unusual look for a Japanese politician. As Japan's new minister of digital reform, his task is to make the stubbornly analogue Japanese government work a bit more like him.
Japan has some of the world's best digital infrastructure, with top-notch mobile and broadband networks. Yet interacting with government agencies often involves slogging through labyrinthine offices and leafing through paperwork. In a survey of 30 countries in the oecd, a club mostly of rich countries, Japan ranked last in terms of providing digital services: only 7.3% of citizens requested anything from the government online in 2018, a fraction of Iceland's 80%, and behind even countries considered relative technological backwaters, such as Slovakia and Mexico.
Suga Yoshihide, Japan's prime minister since September, has vowed to ""advance digitisation in government"". He is not the first to make such a promise: an e-government strategy announced in 2001 set the goal of putting all of Japan's administrative procedures online by 2003. Yet as of 2019 just 7.5% of the nearly 56,000 processes handled by the national government can be completed online. Mr Suga, however, is putting more weight behind the drive to digitise than any of his predecessors. A new ""digital agency"" is being set up to oversee reforms. The creation of such a body not only signals the commitment of the prime minister, argues Nomura Atsuko of the Japan Research Institute, a think-tank in Tokyo, it also protects the project from the political winds.
Covid-19 exposed Japan's ""half-baked digitalisation"", Mr Hirai says. Whereas South Korea got cash relief to 97% of households in two weeks, Japan's payments took months and in many cases required in-person visits or handwritten forms. Even applications for subsidies to buy equipment for teleworking had to be completed largely by hand. Such failures shook bureaucrats out of a long slumber. ""These are things people need to do, that they know they need to do, but kicked the can down the road,"" Mr Hirai says. ""All of a sudden they're willing to do it."" The ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently purchased 400 tablet computers for mps to encourage them to go paperless, Mr Hirai smiles.
The new agency, which will be launched soon, is meant to act as a ""control tower"" for the government's it policies. ""The national government has its own digital architecture, each ministry has its own unique digital architecture, and then each local government has its own unique ar- ? chitecture, so there's no interoperability within the government, laments Sato Motohiko of the Japan Association of New Economy, an e-business lobby group. The agency will consolidate control over it procurement previously devolved to different arms of government. Mr Hirai aims to shift the bureaucracy to cloud-based systems to make it easier to share data. The Daiwa Institute of Research, a think-tank, reckons that digitisation of government services could boost gdp per person by more than 1%-a hefty improvement.
The first step involves ending archaic habits. Kono Taro, Japan's minister for administrative reform, catalogued some 15,000 circumstances in which a hanko, or personal seal, was required to carry out a bureaucratic procedure; now, he says, only 83 remain. Fax machines, still a staple of the Japanese office, have come under fire. So too has the custom of sending email attachments as zip files with a password in a separate message, which does little to enhance security but causes untold inconvenience. After that come harder tasks. ""We need to take the second step: from digitising data to utilising data, says a former senior official. That, in turn, will involve breaking down the barriers between ministries, says Robert Ward of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London.
According to Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, goods consisting of intellectual property, such as software, account for less than 3% of the Japanese government's fixed assets, compared with 8% for America's. Wider adoption of the national id card, known as ""My Number, would make it easier to put services online, but many Japanese have resisted because of privacy concerns. Going digital also threatens to alienate the elderly. Mr Hirai envisions turning bureaucrats who now sit behind windows at counters receiving forms into ""digital-support workers to help ageing residents learn to apply for services on smartphones.
Finally, for the digital agency to make a difference, Mr Hirai will have to find the talent to staff it. The government lacks engineers and it specialists. Competition is already fierce in the private sector. Mr Hirai hopes to make the agency feel more Silicon Valley than Tokyo ministry. His slogan is ""Government as a startup. He points to Taiwan's popular digital minister, Audrey Tang, as a model. ""Jeans will be fine, he says, a radical departure from the suit and tie that are de rigueur in Japanese government offices. Engineers will be paid at competitive rates and allowed to work remotely. A tech leader from the private sector will be tapped to head the agency. ""The challenge of changing a national system is attractive, Mr Hirai says. That may be so- but it will not be easy.

Pakistan has fenced itself off from Afghanistan
KABUL
The tribesmen outside the Pakistani embassy in Kabul huddle into their woollen shawls and wait. A few years ago, grumble Abdul Haq Barakzai and his friends, a trip to Pakistan for medical treatment was as straightforward as slipping a border guard a few hundred rupees. As well as the main crossing at Torkham, a rich choice of tracks led across the mountainous frontier. No paperwork was needed to cross. Now he must stand in line with a bundle of doctors' notes to obtain a visa.
The 2,600km boundary between Afghanistan and Pakistan was marked out in 1893 by Sir Mortimer Durand as the limit of British India (see map). The arbitrary frontier has long been ignored by tribesmen, traders and guerrillas on either side. Ihsanullah Shinwari, a businessman in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, describes how he and his friends used to nip across to eat fried fish in the Afghan city of Jalalabad: ""It wasn't like going to a different country.
This porousness has loomed large in world affairs. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, America funnelled weapons over the border to rebels. When America invaded Afghanistan, in turn, in 2001, the Taliban flitted back and forth from havens in Pakistan. And for decades a large share of the world's supply of heroin was spirited across to Pakistan.
All that began to change in 2016, when a thin metal line of chain-link fencing and razor wire, punctuated by forts, slowly unspooled along the border through the Hindu Kush mountains and the deserts of Balochistan. Dozens of unofficial crossing points have been closed and cross-border travel is being channelled to 16 formal posts. Despite winding through some of the most rugged and inhospitable landscapes on Earth, the fence will be complete in weeks, says Pakistan's government.
America, among others, has for years advocated building a fence, in the hope of stemming the insurgency in Afghanistan. But in the end Pakistan moved ahead because of terrorists mounting attacks on its side of the border before seeking refuge in Afghanistan, not the other way round. Pakistani soldiers are bullish about the effect so far. They credit the fence with reducing attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (ttp), a home-grown militant group.
Western observers are more doubtful, saying a fence alone cannot bring security, particularly in such terrain. ""A fence is useless if you can't observe it. You and I could walk up with a pair of wire-cutters and go through, and then it's not a fence, carps a Western military official. The scale and profitability of smuggling across the border mean that smugglers will not meekly shut up shop. Sceptics also point out that the Afghan Taliban have been able to cross the frontier easily not because there used to be no fence, but because Pakistan's armed forces let them.
Afghanistan's government, meanwhile, does not accept the Durand line and claims parts of north-west Pakistan, so it is unhappy with the fence. But Moeed Yusuf, Pakistan's national security adviser, says the fence will improve relations and even boost trade in the long run. The movement of fighters both ways has caused recriminations on both sides, he says: ""This element of mistrust must be removed. The only way to do it from our view is ultimately to fence the border.
In practice, the biggest repercussions of the fence may be for the Pushtun tribes that straddle the frontier. They now need passports and visas to visit relatives. Mr Yusuf says Pakistan is handing out visas readily. Long-term multiple-entry permits will be common, he says: the border will be more like one in Europe than anything designed by President Donald Trump.
Mr Barakzai and his fellow applicants say they have yet to see any sign of that. They complain of long waits and stickyfingered officials. As crossing becomes more laborious, some dispersed families are choosing to consolidate on one side or another. ""It's just getting harder and harder, Mr Barakzai moans."

TAKEO
Jobless Cambodians are catching rats to feed Vietnamese city dwellers
Slung over Pen Keo's shoulder is a big wicker basket containing wire-mesh traps, which he lays, one by one, on a rice field where rats are known to scamper. There are so many traps there already, it is difficult to find space for his. In Takéo, a rural province in southern Cambodia, rat-catching serves two purposes. The creatures would otherwise ravage crops, and can also be sold for tidy sums in neighbouring Vietnam. There rats nourished on a free-range diet of rice stalks and roots are a delicacy.
For a growing number of Cambodians, rat-catching is a full-time job. The covid-19 pandemic has hurt the formal economy. Unemployment is on the rise. The Asian Development Bank thinks that Cambodia, with a working-age population of 9m or so, lost around 500,000 jobs in 2020. Many who worked in the city have gone home to the countryside, but work there is scarce, too. Between January and April farmers' wages dropped by a third, according to Angkor Research and Consulting and Future Forum, a think-tank. Mr Pen Keo says he no longer earns enough from tilling his fields because rice is too cheap. Like many hard-up Cambodians, he has exchanged his plough for rat-traps.
Yet chasing tail, too, is no longer as profitable as it was. On a good day Mr Pen Keo catches 15kg, or about 130 of the pests. But whereas he used to get 6,000 riel ($1.48) for every kilo he caught, now he makes two-thirds of that. The slump in prices is being felt further along the supply chain as well. Ton, a rat-broker from Bourei Cholsar, the same district as Mr Pen Keo, now earns 50,000 riel a day, half what he used to get. Mr Pen complains of too much competition. Since April the number of rat-catchers in his village of 500 has doubled to 100, he says. The headman of the group of villages to which Bourei Cholsar belongs reckons that a third of locals now trap rodents.
Even as the supply of Cambodian rats has shot up, demand from Vietnam has tailed off. Officially, the border has been closed since March, making it harder to take the rats to market. Brokers have to pay off Vietnamese border guards and smuggle their catch across a river, risking fines and imprisonment. Another Cambodian catcher, Chhoeun Kha, suspects the pandemic has made Vietnamese less enthusiastic about eating rats, for fear they harbour diseases. It is not an absurd concern. A study conducted a couple of years ago in southern Vietnam found that 56% of field rats served in restaurants tested positive for a raft of coronaviruses.
Mr Chhoeun Kha would be heartened by the scene at Chuot Dong (""Field Rat), a working-class restaurant on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, in southern Vietnam. It does a roaring trade in field rats, which are butchered on the spot, marinated in garlic, chilies, lemongrass, and fish sauce, and then fried or delicately grilled. Giao and his colleagues eat there two or three times a week. For him, eating field rat is as normal as slurping up a bowl of noodles. ""Whenever I see a fat rat on a grill, says Xuan, a colleague, ""I cannot hold my saliva. But do they ever worry that the rodents will make them ill? ""Sewer rats and house mice eat everything in the city, which is poisonous, says Giao. But field rats? They are perfectly safe, he insists."

COLOMBO
The government is forcibly cremating Muslims who die of covid-19
Outside a hospital in southern Sri Lanka on December 22nd, a handful of Muslim men bowed their heads against the rain, chanting prayers as an unpolished coffin was loaded into an ambulance. They were given just minutes to pay their respects to the deceased, who, doctors said, had tested positive for covid-19. But that was not the most distressing part of it. Against the wishes of his family, his body was being rushed not to a cemetery, but to a crematorium.
Muslims make up nearly one in ten Sri Lankans. Their religiously ordained practice of burying the dead has rarely caused problems, even though the island's two biggest religions, Buddhism (the faith of some 70% of Sri Lankans) and Hinduism (13%) practise cremation. With the pandemic approaching last spring, the government issued guidelines that permitted burial of those infected provided the grave was at least six feet deep and the water table low enough not to get contaminated. However, when the disease claimed its first Muslim victim on March 31st, hospital workers defied the victim's family and had him cremated.
Soon afterwards, the health ministry issued new rules making it compulsory to cremate everyone who had died of covid-19-for the greater good. Burials attract crowds, it argued. Pro-government media also cited ""experts"" who claimed the virus could leech from bodies into the soil and contaminate groundwater. A government doctor warned that ""unwanted persons"" might gain access to a corpse and use it as a biological weapon.
The new rules prompted an outcry, not just from pious Muslims but from scientists, human-rights groups, diplomats and even the United Nations. Yet the authorities are unsympathetic. In December the courts dismissed a batch of petitions from Muslim families without explanation. The government has offered nothing more than a review of the policy by an unnamed ""expert panel"".
In the meantime, the forced cremations have continued. On December 9th a staterun children's hospital in Colombo, the capital, cremated Mohamed Shaykh, a 20day-old baby, over the objections of his parents and despite questionable evidence that he had covid-19. The Shaykhs have declined to collect their son's ashes. Other Muslim families, too, have refused to sign cremation orders, to claim bodies from hospitals or to pay bills for cremation. One Muslim group has bought a refrigerated lorry to hold bodies until the government's review is completed. On December 28th officials are said to have forcibly removed five corpses from the lorry for cremation. More than a dozen are thought to remain.
Hilmy Ahamed of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka claims that more than 80 Muslim victims of covid-19 have now been forcibly cremated. Muslim offers to bury the bodies in specially sealed concrete graves have been ignored, he notes. He blames anti-Muslim prejudice on the government's part. Such abrupt dismissal of Muslim concerns, he argues, is pushing young Muslims towards militancy.
Ironically, it was co-ordinated suicide bombings by Islamist extremists in 2019 that have heightened other Sri Lankans' suspicion of Muslims. The trauma of the bombings helped propel the double election victory of the Buddhist nationalist Rajapaksa family, with two brothers, Gotabaya and Mahinda, serving as president and prime minister respectively.
In a statement to Parliament a year ago, Gotabaya Rajapaksa promised to make sure Sri Lanka had only ""one law for all the people"". This has since become a slogan, widely repeated on social media. On December 29th a large crowd led by chauvinist Buddhist monks marched to the office of the president in Colombo and presented a petition arguing that allowing Muslim victims of covid-19 to be buried would violate the president's clearly stated policy. There cannot be religious laws for some, one prelate shouted: ""After running the government so well for one year, will you ruin it all for a dead body?"""

""Confucian land"" is a cultural exhibition in the South Korean city of Andong. It first asks visitors to reflect on the horrors of contemporary society, including war, consumerism and sexual licence. It then invites them to travel through a ""tunnel of time"" to 16th-century Korea, when Confucianism was the official philosophy of the royal court. The Korea of yore is portrayed as a harmonious Utopia, save for the occasional battle against Japanese invaders. Virtuous conduct, imply the displays charting the daily life of a Confucian scholar in a humble village, underpinned perfect social cohesion.
Some observers, including both Koreans and foreigners, are inclined to attribute all the successes of contemporary South Korea to the lingering influence of Confucianism. Rapid economic development, the academic prowess of Korean students, even the largely successful curbing of covid-19-it is all thanks to the ancient Chinese system of thought imported to Korea two thousand years ago. Others go to the opposite extreme, blaming Confucianism for all manner of latter-day blights, including authoritarianism, sexism, stifling workplace hierarchies and entrenched corruption in industrial conglomerates.
To attribute all that is good or bad to Confucianism more than a century after it ceased to be Korea's official state ideology is, at best, absurdly reductive. Yet it is invoked in part because it remains so visible. Kwon Seok-hwan shows visitors around the school in Andong founded by Yi Hwang, the 16th-century Confucian scholar who graces the 1,000-won bill. He insists that Yi Hwang continues to be a role model, for his renunciation of worldly concerns in the pursuit of knowledge. Long-suffering pupils across the country are taught classical poetry and calligraphy, all with a Confucian bent. Confucian ceremonies to revere ancestors remain common practice among many Korean families.
Inevitably, Confucian tradition has taken on a political tint. ""It's often used as a label whenever people want to praise or criticise society,"" says Kim Do-il of the Institute of Confucian Philosophy and Culture at Sungkyunkwan University (the successor to a Confucian academy set up in the 14th century). What people say about Confucianism often provides a clue to their contemporary political convictions.
One notable example is Park Chunghee, a military dictator in the 1960s and 1970s, who redefined the Confucian virtues of filial piety and loyalty in a way that legitimised his authoritarianism, says Ro Young-chan of George Mason University. Park wanted citizens to identify with the state. In effect, he sought to create the ""obedient Asians"" of racist stereotypes, a trope that has resurfaced during the pandemic to explain more conscientious mask-wearing and social distancing in South Korea than in America or Europe.
Park is not the only one to have used Confucianism. Feminists invoke the term to grumble about women's outsize domestic duties, or the expectation that they will pour drinks for male friends. Twenty-somethings cite it when lamenting parental meddling in their personal affairs. Conservatives say that deference to elders and humility towards strangers are national traits based on Confucian values, which are sadly being eroded by modern ideas. One told your correspondent that Confucius wanted to live in Korea because its inhabitants were so polite-a claim that is hard to verify 2,500 years after the sage's demise.
But even if the invocation of Confucianism says more about the invoker's disdain for social convention or nostalgia for a non-existent past than about the tradition itself, that still reflects its enduring influence. Mr Ro of George Mason University argues that Confucianism forms part of South Korea's social subconscious, which leads people to assume (and chafe against) certain social norms even if they rarely think about their origins. ""If you ask a random stranger in the street, they won't say they're Confucian,"" he says. ""But they'll still be aware of certain expectations about how to behave-as a sibling, a child, an employee-which are connected to those ideas.""
Mr Kim agrees that Confucian values are a living influence on Korean society. But they are increasingly in conflict with newer ideas about individual freedom, personal autonomy, sexual equality and the like. As elsewhere, sublimating disputes about how liberal a society should be into blanket reverence or disdain for ""traditional values"" does not make the underlying argument any easier to resolve."

ZIYUN
Extreme poverty is history in China, officials say
EARLY IN DECEMBER CHINA announced that it had eradicated extreme poverty within its territory. This achievement is breathtaking in scale. By the World Bank's estimate, some 800m people in China have escaped penury in the past four decades. It is a triumph for the ages, too, as state media have noted. Never before in the country's history has destitution come anywhere close to being eliminated.
One of the final places declared povertyfree is Ziyun, a county in the south-western province of Guizhou. ""Speaking frankly, it's a lie, says Liang Yong, a gruff villager. The official investigation of Ziyun's economy was, he says, perfunctory. Provincial leaders popped into his village, rendered their verdict that it had left poverty behind and then sped off. ""It's a show. In our hearts we all know the truth, he grumbles.
But a hard-headed observer would side with the government. Things are undoubtedly difficult for Mr Liang. Pork is pricey these days, so he eats meat just a couple of times a week. After paying his two children's school fees, he has little money left. To ward off the winter, he sits close to a coal-fired stove. He is poorer than many others in China, especially in its cities. He does not like to see victory over poverty being celebrated when he cannot afford proper medical care for his father, recently diagnosed with lung cancer. But the ability to scrape enough together for meat, education and heating marks Mr Liang as someone who has in fact left extreme poverty-a condition in which basic needs go unmet.
Sceptics understandably ask whether China fiddled its numbers in order to win what it calls the ""battle against poverty. There are of course still isolated cases of abject deprivation. China, however, set itself a fairly high bar. It has regularly raised the official poverty line, which, accounting for living costs, is about $2.30 a day at prices prevailing in 2011. (By comparison, the World Bank defines as extremely poor those who make less than $1.90 a day, as roughly a tenth of human beings do. Poverty lines in rich countries are much higher: the equivalent line in America is about $72 a day for a four-member household at 2020 prices.) In 1978, shortly after Mao's death, nearly 98% of those in the countryside lived in extreme poverty, by China's current standards. By 2016 that was down to less than 5% (see chart on next page).
The government's biggest contribution was to pull back from central planning and let people make money. It decollectivised agriculture, giving farmers an incentive to produce more. It allowed people to move around the country to find work. It gave more freedom to entrepreneurs. It helped by building roads, investing in education and courting foreign investors. Its goal was to boost the economy; alleviating poverty was a welcome side-effect.
The government's approach changed in 2015 when Xi Jinping, its leader, vowed to eradicate the last vestiges of extreme poverty by the end of 2020. Officials jumped to it. They tried to encourage personal initiative by rewarding poor people who found ways of bettering their lot (see picture). They spent public money widely. In 2015 central-government funding earmarked for poverty alleviation was an average of 500 yuan ($77) per extremely poor person. In 2020 the allocation per head was more than 26,000 yuan (see chart).
The imprint of the anti-poverty campaign is visible everywhere in Ziyun. The walls of government offices are covered in murals. One depicts a plant, labelled as the ""roots of poverty"", being yanked from the soil. Slogans dot the main roads-some admirably simple (""Let farmers make more money""), others lofty (""To help people out of poverty, first help them become wise"").
One of the biggest challenges has been the terrain where the poor live. The 832 counties-about 30% of the country's total-that were designated as povertystricken when Mr Xi began his anti-poverty campaign were all mainly rural. Most were mountainous or on inhospitable land. Officials used two basic approaches to help these counties. Both are visible in Ziyun.
The first was to introduce industry- mostly modern agriculture. In Luomai, a village in Ziyun, the government created a 25-hectare zone for growing and processing shiitake mushrooms. About 70 locals work there. In the past their only options were either to migrate elsewhere or to eke out a meagre existence farming maize. But the shiitake are a cash crop, letting them earn about 80 yuan a day, a decent wage.
There is an irony in this. In the 1980s China broke up communal farms, letting people strike out on their own. Now the government wants them to pool their resources again. Officials often describe it as turning farmers into ""shareholders"". Residents get stakes in new rural enterprises, which, all going well, will pay dividends. Big outside companies are often placed in charge of the projects. The Luomai shiitake farm is run by China Southern Power Grid, a state-owned firm. But there is a risk that as the anti-poverty campaign fades away, some projects will fizzle.
The second approach to helping hard-up villages was more radical: moving inhabitants to better-connected areas. Between 2016 and 2020 officials relocated about 10m people. China has long moved people around on a huge scale to allow development-for instance clearing out homes to build dams. But in this case resettlement was itself the development project. The government concluded that it was too costly to provide necessary services, from roads to health care, to the most remote villages. It reckoned that moving residents closer to towns would work better.
A collection of tidy yellow apartment blocks sits in the centre of Ziyun county. It is a settlement for former inhabitants of a poor village some distance away. A frequent problem after moving people into such housing is finding work for them. In this case, the government called on local officials to arrange jobs for at least one member of each household. At the gate to the new compound in Ziyun, women hunch over sewing machines in small workshops. A middle-aged resident says she could not handle that work, so officials gave her a job in a sanitation crew. She is pleased with her new surroundings. There is a good school just across the street, which is far better for her child.
A bigger challenge is relative deprivation, a problem abundantly evident to anyone who has travelled between the glitzy coastal cities and the drabber towns of the hinterland. People may have incomes well above the official poverty line, but they can still feel poor. A recent study by Chinese economists concluded that the ""subjective poverty line"" in rural areas was about 23 yuan per day, nearly twice the amount below which a person would be officially classified as poor. That conforms with a standard used by many economists, namely setting the relative poverty line at half the median income level. It suggests that about a third of rural Chinese still see themselves as poor.
If poverty is calculated this way it becomes almost impossible to eliminate, since the poverty line steadily rises as the country gets richer. But one virtue of using a relative definition is that it better matches the way people feel. China does not count any poverty in its cities because welfare safeguards supposedly help those without money. But workers who have moved from the countryside lack the right documentation for ready access to urban welfare. And for any city-dweller, support is meagre. In relative terms about a fifth of China's urban residents can be classified as poor, according to a recent paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research by Chen Shaohua and Martin Ravallion.
To reduce relative poverty, China needs different tactics from the ones used in its campaign against extreme poverty. It would have to redistribute incomes, for example by imposing heavier taxes on the rich and making it easier for migrants to obtain public services in cities-policies for which it has shown little eagerness.
On the streets of Guiyang, the booming capital of Guizhou, hardship is still a common sight. Men walk with straw baskets strapped to their backs, looking for work as load-carriers. Zhou Weifu, a porter in his 50s, scoffs at the suggestion that poverty is over. ""What kind of work is this? I can barely make any money,"" he says. China has every right to be proud of its victory over dire poverty. But officials would be wise to keep their celebrations muted."

THE AFAQ KHOJA mausoleum in Kashgar is one of the holiest places in Xinjiang, a region in the far west of China. The site is politically charged, too. Several 19th-century uprisings against Chinese rule began with rebels making a pilgrimage to the shrine, and its tomb of Afaq Khoja, a divisive figure revered by some locals as a Sufi Muslim saint, and scorned by others as a traitor. It is beautiful, with stately domes and minarets rendered as exquisite as a jewel box by tiles of green, blue, yellow and brown. To one side lies an ancient cemetery fringed with poplar trees. Its mud and brick tombs were capped with snow when Chaguan visited. As remote as it is lovely, the shrine lies closer to Baghdad than to Beijing.
Not all Muslim sites are as protected. In recent years China has worked to stamp out any hint of religious fervour in Xinjiang. Perhaps a million of the region's ethnic-Uyghurs have been accused of radical Islamic thinking and sent to re-education camps. Domes and minarets, deemed an ""Arabic"" import, have been removed from many buildings. An analysis of satellite images published in September 2020 by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a research group, estimates that over 8,000 mosques have been destroyed. That is one-third of all those recorded in Xinjiang by a census in 2004. Xinjiang's government insists that it has never ""forcibly demolished"" religious sites, and has merely improved old mosques that were unsafe in earthquakes or heavy rain, or ""poorly laid-out"". The claim is not hard to disprove. In the oasis city of Hotan, Chaguan saw the bare ground where the small Gulluk Kowruk mosque stood, and visited the corner of Wenhua and Taibei Roads, from which a larger mosque has simply vanished.
Officials have not demolished the Afaq Khoja shrine. Instead they are trying to neutralise its power as a place so sacred that pilgrims would collect dust from its grounds. Their tool: mass tourism by China's ethnic-Han majority. Their method is to link the site to Xiang Fei, or the ""Fragrant Concubine"". She was a Kashgar woman who, according to Chinese legend, enraptured the 18thcentury Qianlong emperor with her mysterious natural scent, after being captured and delivered to his harem. Her story appeared in print in 1892 and inspired poems, operas and a television drama in the 1990s. Early accounts call Xiang Fei the wife (or daughter) of a descendant of Afaq Khoja. Drawing on Chinese traditions venerating chaste widows, they describe her resistance to the emperor, whom she planned to stab with tiny daggers hidden in her sleeves, and her death by execution. Anxious to promote ethnic unity, Communist-era writers insist that she loved the emperor and died of illness. For decades a sign has marked her supposed tomb at the Afaq Khoja shrine. Imperial archives record a simpler tale: a Kashgar woman who became the emperor's consort and is buried near Beijing, notes Rian Thum of Loyola University in New Orleans, in his book ""The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History"".
Unfussed by historical details, officials opened a tourist park called Xiang Fei Garden in 2015. At its far northern end lies the mausoleum, relabelled ""Fragrant Imperial Concubine's Tomb"". Signs point tour groups towards Uyghur folk-dance shows and praise ""soft and humble"" Xiang Fei. Her purported love for China's emperor is called a symbol of ""the reunification of the motherland"". Pilgrims are discouraged by the gates and guards that surround public buildings in Xinjiang. Outside the shrine's perimeter, Chaguan saw an old man scooping dust into a bag, but did not ask why. It is unsafe for Uyghurs to speak to foreign reporters. The same unmarked Volkswagen followed your columnist all day.
It is not just mass tourism that is changing Kashgar. The city's old town has been largely rebuilt since 2009, with adobe-walled alleys levelled to create earthquake-proof, tourist-friendly streets lined with kebab stalls and handicrafts shops. A more recent trend has seen an influx of Han hipsters and artistic types bent on turning Uyghur traditions into profit. Oppressive security, involving cameras and police checkpoints at every turn, does not deter them.
Chaguan met a young photographer from Dali, a city in southern China, taking wedding pictures of a Han couple in Uyghur robes. The couple wanted a ""special ethnic look"", his helper explained. Nearby, on Baishiairike Alley, a café called Zebra Commune was opened in 2019 by a couple from the south-western city of Chengdu. A post on Dianping, a review website, enthuses: ""I'm so pleased a shop is finally doing southern Xinjiang culture right."" In a video blog the co-founder, Wang Li (who prefers the name Mrs Zebra), shows off herbal teas sold in the café's carpet-bedecked halls, as well as a narrow tower she calls her little secret place. More jarringly, a posting by her husband, ""Mr Zebra"", admits that, when they first arrived, bicycles outside their café had tyres slashed, and excrement was left on their steps. He ascribes this to ""misunderstandings"" caused by ""the unique nature of the space"".
A colony by any other name
That is an understatement. Zebra Commune is a former mosque, its quaint tower a minaret with its crescent moon knocked off. Photographs from 2014 show a bustling place of worship, with a dozen people praying on rugs outside. The café recently closed, prompting dismay from a Kashgar official who praised the couple online for investing so much work in the business. Another exmosque, in Areya Road, was a bar until it closed in October, hit by a covid-induced lull in tourism. Online, Chinese travellers praise its generous measures of alcohol. A public lavatory, labelled ""Tourist Toilet"", fills much of the ground floor.
Asked where a prayer service might be found, a man named the city's largest mosque, the Idh Kah, then hurried off. An unscientific survey of the old town found six mosques locked shut, with dead leaves and other debris littering their courtyards. Several had lost domes, minarets and crescent moons. Strolling tourists could easily miss their former purpose. Many might not care. To smother a culture, it turns out, tour buses are as effective as bulldozers. *"

Laws to punish human-rights abusers are growing teeth
The balding figure looks frail and harmless, sitting in the dock behind a Perspex screen in the German town of Koblenz, where the rivers Rhine and Moselle unite. But appearances can deceive. Anwar Raslan, 57, once a Syrian policeman, has been charged with torturing more than 4,000 people and murdering at least 58 between 2011 and 2012, when Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, set about crushing the initially peaceful demonstrations that shook his regime as the Arab spring took off.
Mr Raslan is on trial because, by his own lights, he made a mistake. Having fallen out with the regime, in 2012 he joined the exodus of Syrians who ended up in Germany, where he seemed to be settling down nicely with his family in a Berlin suburb, until one of his alleged victims, by a fluke, spotted his presence-and told a humanrights group. With the encouragement of ngos, in particular the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ecchr), Germany's judicial authorities applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, whereby human-rights violators of any nationality can be charged in any country, no matter where the crimes were committed. Mr Raslan was arrested in 2019. His trial began in Koblenz in April 2020 and may last for more than a year.
Scores of witnesses will be called before five German judges. Thousands of photographs collected by a Syrian military photographer may be shown. A gravedigger has described the condition of hundreds of bodies, often mutilated in the dungeons of the building where Mr Raslan is said to have worked, which were thrown into mass graves. A catalogue of torture is being spelt out in court, including electric shocks, the pulling out of fingernails, beatings with cables and whips, hanging upside down, dousing with cold water and rape-nothing was too cruel.
The idea of universal jurisdiction won global attention in 1998 when a murderous former president of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, mistakenly presuming diplomatic immunity, was arrested in Britain at the request of a Spanish judge-and was eventually sent home. Since then the practice has gathered pace. A new case opened on December 3rd in a court in Switzerland, where Alieu Kosiah, a Liberian former commander, is being tried for crimes such as mass murder and recruiting child soldiers, allegedly committed during a civil war more than 20 years ago in his home country.
The number of universal jurisdiction cases is rising. Máximo Langer, an Argentinine expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, counts 815 such cases from 2008 to 2017, nearly as many as in the previous two decades put together. At least 16 countries have heard cases under universal jurisdiction; 71 cases have been completed, mostly with convictions. About 40% of the defendants have been African, a quarter from the Middle East, a fifth from Europe and 8% from Asia. Other regions may follow; Argentina is keen to use this powerful tool. Some countries allow universal-jurisdiction trials in absentia.
Spain and Belgium led the way in pursuing cases under universal jurisdiction. The Netherlands, the Nordics and Switzerland are prominent among countries where such cases are being tried. Germany is in the vanguard. According to Patrick Kroker of the ecchr, which has helped at least a dozen plaintiffs in the Koblenz trial, 110 cases are now being investigated under universal jurisdiction in Germany, most of them to do with Iraq and Syria (concerning both the Assad regime and the slave-owning jihadists of Islamic State). The Koblenz case is the first where a member of the Syrian regime, albeit of middle rank, is facing justice in court.
Human-rights campaigners do not see universal jurisdiction as a rival system to the various international courts set up in the past two decades or so, culminating in the International Criminal Court (icc). Rather, it is complementary. It is useful because the old system has holes in it. For example, the creation of UN-backed international courts and tribunals for Syria has been stymied by powerful countries (often China and Russia) which scorn the concept of individual rights and are bent on protecting their protégés. ""The icc has been blocked over Syria,"" laments Fergal Gaynor, an Irish human-rights lawyer who is bidding to be the ice's next chief prosecutor. ""So an expansive universal justice system has had to step in.""
The ice, which started to operate in The Hague in 2002, remains the cornerstone of an ambitious new architecture of international justice. It is the sole permanent court where grand-scale offenders, including heads of governments and states, can face justice for serious crimes, the ""core"" ones being torture, crime of aggression, crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Two-thirds of the world's countries-123 at last count, 33 of them African- have signed up to it. Its main message is that no leader should consider himself (rarely, so far, herself) to have impunity.
The ice has stumbled largely because of geopolitics. It can function properly only if its signatories fulfil their obligations to arrest and send those indicted to The Hague. A clutch of important countries-the United States, China, Russia and India-have refused to sign up, citing encroachments on sovereignty. Cases can be referred to the icc only by the un Security Council or with the consent of the country where the crimes occurred. The council has referred only two cases, during brief moments when America, China and Russia decided not to block: Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's president, was indicted for alleged genocide in his country's western region, Darfur; and Libya's late dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, was indicted at the height of the Arab spring, when he was bombing civilians in the city of Benghazi.
Going down in Africa
The ice has succeeded in convicting only a handful of big men, all of them African. Several African governments, at first keen on the court after the genocide in Rwanda, have concluded that it was anti-African, though all the African cases, bar Libya's and Sudan's, had been referred to the ice by African governments themselves.
It was thanks to the mediation of a recently retired secretary-general of the un, Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian, that in 2011 Kenya's then government was persuaded to let the ice indict two rivals, after a bloodily disputed election. It charged Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, who later became president and vice-president, with crimes against humanity, but later had to drop the charges. ""The ice was no match for Kenya's government,"" says Reed Brody, an American human-rights lawyer. ""It controlled everything-the country, the witnesses, the evidence. No way could the people in The Hague win."" The ice was humiliated.
The failure of states to arrest Sudan's Mr Bashir as he swanned around Africa, even though they had signed up to the ice, was another reminder of the court's lack of authority: South Africa rolled out the red carpet for him. Another low point for it was when Laurent Gbagbo, a former president of Ivory Coast, whom it had charged with crimes against humanity, was acquitted eight years later.
Supporters of the ice cite other tribunals backed by the un that did bring justice to the many victims of atrocities during Yugoslavia's break-up in the 1990s and during Rwanda's genocide, which saw perhaps 500,000 people murdered, mostly with machetes, in 1994. Around 90 ex-Yugoslav and 61 Rwandan culprits were sentenced to prison, many for life. A final appeal by Ratko Mladic, the general who oversaw the massacre of 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, will be heard in 2021, closing a judicial process that has lasted a generation.
While the ice has struggled, other ""hybrid"" courts have been more effective, embracing a medley of ad hoc judicial systems operating under a mix of home-grown and foreign judges. ""The ice will never be a solution for all human-rights violations,"" says Serge Brammertz, a long-serving chief prosecutor for the Yugoslav tribunal. ""I believe in an ă la carte system: the ice has an important but not the only role.""
Mix and match
That may be the best way to go. Mr Brody led a successful campaign to convict Hissene Habré, a mass-murdering former president of Chad who had fled into exile in Senegal, where he was tried and sentenced to life in 2016 by a special UN-backed African court. In that case, though justice was achieved in an ad hoc court, the legal process against Mr Habré was initiated under universal jurisdiction by Belgium, eventually cajoling a new government in Senegal, backed by the African Union, into setting up a special court. Mr Brody says that Mr Habré's Chadian victims were inspired to seek justice by the Pinochet precedent.
Another recent case illustrates the enduring effectiveness of UN-backed tribunals. Félicien Kabuga owned a Rwandan radio station that helped orchestrate the genocide, urging neighbour to slaughter neighbour. He evaded arrest for 26 years; an informant who tried to lead police to him in Kenya in 2003 was found dead in a pool of blood. He was arrested near Paris last May, where he was living under a false identity, and sent to the icc. He may be sent on to the Tanzanian city of Arusha, where a ""special mechanism"" has taken over from the Rwandan tribunal (it closed in 2015) to try the last of the génocidaires.
In the past decade or so other humanrights bodies have also set their sights on the worst offenders. The UN's Human Rights Council (hrc), the nearest thing to a permanent global state-backed monitor, is often ridiculed because its 47-strong membership, chosen in regional groups, often on uncontested slates, always includes a clutch of egregious violators. As of January 1st it embraces the likes of Bahrain, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Russia and Somalia. The council keeps Israel permanently under special scrutiny-the sole country it constantly scolds.
Less toothless than it appears
The United States, an active and effective hrc member under Barack Obama, refused to take part under Donald Trump. Yet despite its faults the hrc is useful. Its system of Universal Periodic Review puts every country in the spotlight every four years. The commissions of inquiry it can order have often laid the groundwork for further investigations, sometimes by other bodies with more teeth. And many of its 50-plus ""special rapporteurs"" and ""independent experts"" have written trenchant exposes of torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions-along with more arcane topics such as the mistreatment of people with albinism and leprosy.
In 2005 the UN endorsed the principle of a ""responsibility to protect"" in cases of genocide or mass atrocities, justifying liberal military interventions. This has largely fallen into disuse. China and Russia are likely to veto any such proposal that comes before the un Security Council.
However, governments that care about human rights have become savvier at getting around such obstacles. Although Mr Assad's regime shows no sign of collapse, a vast body of damning evidence is being collected, which may one day be used in court against the regime's chief villains. The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (cija), a Dutch-based ngo involved in the Koblenz case, is said to have collected 800,000 documents incriminating Mr Assad and his torturers.
Another way of circumventing the big human-rights blockers is to work through the un General Assembly instead of the Security Council. A resolution presented in 2016 by tiny Liechtenstein led to the creation of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (iiim) to investigate crimes in Syria since 2011. Not to be outdone, the almost as tiny Gambia pulled off a similar judicial coup, after the hrc had passed a resolution in 2018 to create an ""Independent, Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar"". The Gambia got the backing of the 57-country Organisation of Islamic Co-operation to take Myanmar to the uN's International Court of Justice (icj), the world's highest court where states may contest each other, for its mistreatment of the Rohingyas, a Muslim minority. In September the Netherlands said it would hold Syria responsible, also at the icj, for gross violations under the UN's Convention against Torture.
Is this panoply of tribunals, laws and reports, which name and shame countries and people, a true deterrent? ""It's impossible to prove a negative,"" says Andrew Gilmour, former deputy head of the UN's High Commission for Human Rights. ""But yes, they do mind-they hate being shamed,"" he says, citing the lengths to which countries such as China go to prevent scrutiny. ""Anyone who says they don't care-it's nonsense,"" says Prince Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the UN's former high commissioner for human rights, who adds hopefully that ""One day the icc will become a powerful court.""
Moreover, there are signs that weaker countries that once kowtowed to China at forums such as the hrc are increasingly reluctant to do so. A row is brewing over the election of the council's next agenda-setting president. China seems bent on stopping Fiji, which takes human rights seriously, from winning the post. Instead it is promoting a pliable candidate of its own, Bahrain. Five years ago China would easily have prevailed; now it is less cocksure.
Back on track
Whereas Mr Trump cared little for human rights, campaigners are confident that President Joe Biden will promote them. He is unlikely to sign up to the icc, particularly as it may investigate America's protege Israel and perhaps, for alleged crimes in Afghanistan, America itself. But Mr Biden is likely to drop Mr Trump's bizarre executive order to put sanctions on the ice's staff, including its chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, should they visit America. The United States may once again tacitly support the ice, as it did before. Mr Biden may also seek to rejoin the hrc, where America under Mr Obama often led the way.
Human-rights campaigners say the enduring web of tribunals and the spread of universal jurisdiction are raising hopes. ""Things are moving in an interesting direction,"" says Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group, a think-tank in Geneva. ""We need a range of tools,"" he adds, hailing the EU and various states for enacting Magnitsky laws (named after a tax accountant murdered for exposing government chicanery in Russia) to prosecute individuals for human-rights violations or grand corruption. ""It's a very different climate,"" says Mr Brody, who is seeking to have Yahya Jammeh, the Gambia's former dictator, extradited from his exile in Equatorial Guinea to face charges of complicity in murder.
""A whole lot of things are happening that make international justice possible,"" says Stephen Rapp, Mr Obama's ambassador for war-crimes issues, who calls himself ""a fan of universal jurisdiction and of hybrid courts"". Patience is in order. Mr Bashir, in detention since he was overthrown in 2019, may yet face justice, perhaps in a hybrid court in Sudan. Mr Raslan, the Syrian policeman on trial in Koblenz, may not be the sort of bigwig the ice is intended to nail. But for torture victims in Syria, the trial is a welcome step. The evidence piling up, thanks to universal jurisdiction in Germany and elsewhere, suggests that Mr Assad may not enjoy impunity forever. *"

The next big thing in retail comes with Chinese characteristics
Almost everyone in China knows ""Austin"" Li Jiaqi. The 28-year-old ""Lipstick Brother"", started out flogging make-up products in Nanchang, a provincial city, and now sells them to millions by live-streaming on Taobao, part of Alibaba, China's biggest internet retailer-once shifting 15,000 sticks of lipstick in five minutes. Some will recognise Chen Yi, nicknamed ""Little Monster"", a 24-year-old girl-next-door from the coastal city of Qingdao who sells sunscreen, snacks and lots more besides to her 20,000 followers on WeChat, a ubiquitous messaging app: a nice supplement to her day job as a bartender. More obscure but no less enterprising, farmers and fishermen show off juicy apples or prize lobsters in short videos, digital showmanship accompanied by new delivery networks that allow city dwellers to procure the produce.
Such are the faces-lipsticked, sunscreened, weather-worn or besnorkeled- that have helped propel an explosion of ecommerce in China. In rapid-fire videos or days-long jamborees, they flicker across hundreds of millions of smartphone screens in a cyber-bazaar that in 2019 was almost twice the size of those of America, Britain, Germany, Japan and South Korea combined-and growing faster (see chart 1 on next page).
As online shopping has soared, even before covid-19 added extra fuel, Chinese internet firms have dreamed up new ways to engage consumers. In contrast to Taobao, the new ventures do not yet make money. But they are growing apace. Chinese tech firms are pouring fortunes into them. Some of this capital flows straight back out as subsidies to entice buyers and sellers to the platforms, which clearly cannot go on for ever. But the effervescence is here to stay-and Westerners are only starting to notice. ""If you want to see the future, look at China,"" Mark Schneider, boss of Nestlé, the world's biggest food company, instructs his executives. Lubomira Rochet, head of digital marketing at L'Oréal, a French beauty behemoth, contrasts the bottom-up, ""consumer-centric"" vibrancy of Chinese e-commerce with the West's ""tech-driven"", top-down approach.
Some Western tech executives dismiss the Chinese experience as a function not of creativity and enterprise but of structural forces. They cite China's higher mobile share of e-commerce-90% versus 43% in America (see chart 2). Others put it down to a concentrated market, where the top three firms, Alibaba, jD.com and Pinduoduo, account for more than 90% of all digital merchandise sales, a state of affairs that is beginning to trouble Chinese trustbusters, who on December 24th announced an investigation into Alibaba (see box on subsequent page). In America the online titan, Amazon, and its two challengers, Shopify and eBay, accounted for less than 50%.
Yet a survey of Chinese e-commerce reveals genuine dynamism. It is not just Alibaba making the running. In a few years Pinduoduo has captured 14% of the market, helping to trim Alibaba's share from 67% to 61%-and forcing the giant to moderate the ""take rate"" it charges those selling via its platforms. Digital firms from outside retail are muscling in, including Meituan, which started out in food delivery, and ByteDance, which owns TikTok and its Chinese shortvideo cousin, Douyin. The newcomers bring the sort of verve to online shopping in China that characterised America's consumer boom of the 1950s and 1960s.
Indeed, to understand the evolution of Chinese e-commerce, look back to the birth of 20th-century consumerism in America. It was built around overlapping technologies. The car carried people to the suburbs, giving rise to the shopping mall, a place not just to shop but to mingle and have fun. Although radio and television played a role, through advertising and product placement, Western retail's bedrock was-and continues to be-bricks and mortar. According to Bain, a consultancy, America has 3.3 times as much physical shop floor per person as China does. Bernstein, a broker, reckons that America's 330m people have 30 times as many malls as i.4bn Chinese do.
The West's finest shops are as dazzling as ordering on Amazon is drab. They also represent legacy investments that retailers are loth to undermine. As a result, neither retailers nor their customers have had much of an incentive to shun them-at least before covid-19.
Not so in China. Like everyone else in the world, Chinese still buy most things in physical shops. Especially outside big cities, though, many of these are shabby. Some sell fake goods. So China's nascent middle class, armed with smartphones and broadband internet, finds online shopping both more rewarding and comfier than in the West, says Marc-André Kamel of Bain. A high population density makes delivery cheaper for consumers.
The result is a mix of shops, entertainment venues, food courts, games arcades and gathering places that replicates the 20th-century American mall in digital form, and hybrid links of the virtual with the physical. Videos show something being crafted by hand. Influencers draw attention to how the item is used. Friends recommend it (or not) on social media. Shoppers band together with other netizens to buy it in bulk at a discount. Live broadcasts turn the whole process into entertainment. And a network of real-world businesses delivers the purchases.
The anchor cyber-tenant is commonly a super-app like WeChat, which has i.2bn users. It is owned by Tencent, China's biggest internet company-and directs traffic to jD.com and Pinduoduo, in which Tencent holds stakes. The line in people's minds between social networks and shopping websites does not exist in China, notes Frédéric Clément of Lengow, a consultancy. Shoppers love it. Bernstein expects e-commerce to account for more than a quarter of all retail sales in China by 2021, roughly twice the share in America, even after the pandemic-induced stampede online.
The first pillar of this new retail architecture is ""social commerce"". This relies on three related technologies: live-streaming, short-form video and social-networking. The biggest live-streamer is Alibaba's Taobao Live. In just 30 minutes of presales for Singles Day, China's answer to Black Friday, it notched up $7.5bn-worth of sales, about as much as Amazon is thought to have sold in its ""Prime Day"" in October (which actually lasted 48 hours). In June Douyin set up its own shopping platform, having earlier hosted live-streams where the likes of Taobao teamed up with celebrity influencers to sell products. The video-app's 600m daily users confer a valuable resource- their attention. In the autumn it made its proprietary debut on Singles Day.
Fitch, a ratings agency, thinks the market for live-stream retail neared 1trn yuan ($153bn) in 2020, double the prior year's amount (see chart 3 on next page). Kuaishou, Douyin's short-video rival, expects the gross value of goods sold on livestreams to rise from 4.2% of online sales in 2019 to almost a quarter by 2025.
Live-streaming has boomed as covid-19 confined Chinese to their living rooms while many captivating alternatives, like Netflix, remained banned in the country. For people on relatively low salaries, the discounts on some of the merchandise are worth time spent glued to a live-stream. According to Elijah Whaley, marketing chief of parklu, one of a booming cottage industry of influencer agencies, Western brands shipped unsold products to China, where live-streams offered a way to flog them. Ms Rochet says L'Oréal's boss in China was flooded with emojis, likes and questions when he live-streamed a recent sales event. It included ""lucky charms"" that gave a few fortunate shoppers big discounts.
Many bargains are available for bulk purchases. This is where the social networks come in. Pinduoduo, founded in 2015 and now worth $175bn, enables groups, often formed via WeChat, to haggle with merchants, especially on groceries. It still makes a loss and burns cash. But its revenues are soaring, by almost 90% year on year in the third quarter. Seven-year-old Xiaohongshu, or Little Red Book, is already one of China's most popular apps for crossborder commerce, with an estimated 85m users, according to Tenba Group, a consultancy. Its customers, most of whom are young women, exchange shopping experiences via text, images and video. Tenba calls it a Chinese mix of Instagram and Pinterest, two American photo-sharing apps.
The second pillar of China's great digital mall is familiar to Western retailers as ""omnichannel"". Like social commerce, it too has boomed amid pandemic lockdowns and shop closures. In China the biggest e-emporia have their own supermarket businesses, such as Alibaba's Freshippo and jD.com's 7Fresh grocery chain. jD.com also has what it calls a ""new-markets"" business, which works with some of China's 6.8m local grocery stores. It ships them branded goods, delivers what is already on their shelves to local buyers, and feeds them data to optimise their operations.
Some physical retailers, for their part, offer digital coupons to encourage customers to pay a visit, as well as using livestreaming to generate buzz and, hopefully, foot traffic. Others offer ""grab-and-go"" shopping, including staffless stores and smart vending machines where payments are made by scanning qr codes.
Alibaba says that its hybrid sales more than doubled in the 12 months to March 2020, year on year, to 86bn yuan. They rose from 11% of its main retail revenues to 17%. Sales from jD.com's supermarket business grew by 48% year on year in the third quarter. Meituan has broadened its speedy deliveries from takeaway meals to groceries. Mini-warehouses built by startups such as Missfresh, which promises 30-minutes grocery deliveries, are mushrooming in Chinese cities.
Before 2020 both social commerce and hybrid shopping provoked mostly bemusement in the West. Covid-19 has led to a swift reappraisal. As George Lee, Facebook's head of product, puts it, the pandemic was a ""call to action"". The social network caters to the 160m businesses, mostly small and medium-sized, that use its apps and had to shift online as authorities ordered many physical shops to shut.
In May it introduced Facebook Shops, enabling businesses to set up a single online store on its core social network and its sister app, Instagram. In November Instagram redesigned its home screen for the first time in years, introducing tabs called Reels and Shop, which promote short videos, as well as online retail. Facebook's messenger apps, including WhatsApp, can be used to communicate with businesses on its platforms and may eventually be used for sales. Facebook Live also does streaming. In December Walmart, America's largest supermarket chain, held what it called a ""Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular"" on TikTok, with which it has formed a partnership. It allowed viewers to buy some of its fashion items exhibited by celebrities directly via the video app, apeing what Douyin has been doing in China.
Vishal Shah of Instagram makes a distinction between ""buying"" and ""shopping"" to describe Facebook's aim-in other words, turning a utilitarian process into a more personal experience. Other socialmedia firms are moving in the same direction. Since 2020 Snapchat users can try on make-up and shoes virtually, bolstering what the app calls ""shopability"". Shopify has enlisted TikTok to enable its 1m-plus merchants to market their wares by video.
In omnichannel sales, as in most things e-commercial, Amazon is ahead of the pack. It owns almost 500 Whole Foods Market stores and has opened some Amazon Fresh grocers in America that offer free same-day delivery to some members of its Prime subscription service. But big-box retailers like Walmart and Target, whose instore pickups on online purchases have been a hit with covid-wary shoppers fearful of crowded aisles, have made huge strides.
Not everyone thinks that America will follow the trail blazed by China. Bain says that recent inroads notwithstanding, social commerce accounts for a much smaller share of total retail sales in America than in China. Russell Grandinetti, Amazon's head of international retail, says consumers want different things at different times. Sometimes they just want to buy stuff quickly and cheaply, not be wowed by celebrities. He says Amazon pioneered certain browsing techniques, such as online book reviews and tips that ""people who bought this also bought that"". He notes that Prime Video and Twitch, Amazon's gaming platform, have attracted ""millions of customers"" primarily interested in entertainment to its free shipment of goods. As for live-streaming, ""It just hasn't taken off in the West the same way it has in China.""
It will do eventually, Mr Grandinetti thinks. Other observers point out that the sheer size of America's physical retail presence makes the logistics of weaving offline and online cheaper-which may encourage more hybrid shopping models. In other ways America will chart its own path. Pricier labour than in China may lead to faster automation of online fulfilment. Greater concern over privacy relative to convenience may dampen shoppers' appetite for sharing their spending habits with friends on social media.
And China's retail razzmatazz could yet lose its vim. An ageing population will eventually reduce supply of cheap warehouse workers and delivery drivers. That may mean higher delivery fees, longer waiting times, perhaps even unions demanding better working conditions, further raising costs. Trust in influencers, particularly those paid big money to promote brands, is waning. Those making less may lose patience and stick to their day jobs. ""The top 1% make a killing. The rest are starving artists,"" says parklu's Mr Whaley.
Perhaps the main reason Western firms have been slow to emulate Chinese e-commerce is not its inherent flaws but their overspecialisation. From Amazon's home in Seattle and Facebook's in Silicon Valley to Walmart's in Bentonville, American companies have tended to focus on their core business-be it e-commerce, social media or supermarkets. Only recently have they begun to invade each other's turf. In time that may lead to more blurring of business boundaries. As Eric Feng, Facebook's head of commerce incubations, summed it up at a recent virtual panel, tongue only slightly in cheek: ""China, you are the light that will show us the way."" *"

HONG KONG
China's trustbusters go after its mightiest internet titan
ACTING on information, China's .A.State Administration for Market Regulation [samr] has started investigation [into] Alibaba Group for alleged monopoly conduct including implementing an 'exclusive dealing agreement'."" This brief note, posted by Xinhua, the state news agency, on December 24th, was all it took to cut China's mightiest online titan down to size. Not even the announcement three days later of an extra $6bn in share buy-backs arrested the slide in its market value. By December 28th it had fallen by 13%, or $91bn. By comparison, American regulators' detailed charge-sheets against tech giants such as Facebook and Google in recent weeks elicited a yawn from investors.
The Alibaba investigation is the first of its kind into Chinese e-commerce. Its timing-a month after authorities suddenly halted the $37bn initial public offering (ipo) of Alibaba's fintech affiliate, Ant Group, and days before regulators told Ant to curtail lending and wealth-management activities-hints it is China's way of chastening the two firms' flamboyant co-founder, Jack Ma.
That could be. Ant's ipo was put on ice after Mr Ma likened China's state banks to pawn shops. Chinese watchdogs often launch lightning crackdowns to deter others from misbehaving, says Angela Zhang of the University of Hong Kong. But the probe also signals concerns over the online economy, which is effervescent but also ever more concentrated. As investors parsed the Xinhua note, share prices of other internet giants, such as Tencent and Meituan, fell nearly as steeply as Alibaba's.
The complaint against Alibaba centres on the practice of having merchants or brands sign contracts to sell products exclusively on its platform. Those that do business on rival marketplaces risk having internet traffic diverted from their online shopfronts on Alibaba's Tmall emporium to other sellers.
Such arrangements aren't new. In 2015 jD.com, a smaller e-emporium backed by Tencent, filed a legal claim against Alibaba over a similar issue. Nor are they unique to Mr Ma's firm, which launched a competing complaint against jD.com the same year. These and other complaints since have been largely ignored by regulators. Why the about-turn?
Chinese trustbusters long resisted hobbling an industry seen as worldbeating, and backed in Beijing. Now, as in the West, they fret that a few giants control indispensable services-e-commerce, logistics, payments, ride-hailing, food delivery, social media, messaging. Common practices, such as selling products below cost to lure customers, look more troubling in an industry where the top three firms control over 90% of the market than they would in a less concentrated one. In November samr said offering shoppers different prices based on their spending power, divined from user data, may be unlawful.
Another reason for China's newfound zeal (Mr Ma's jibes aside) is greater trustbusting capacity. samr was formed only in 2018, by combining the offices of three regulators.

NEW YORK
America's auction of sg spectrum is turning into a blockbuster
It may be the most hyped technology since blockchain. But even sophisticated telecoms giants are now placing huge bets on sg. In early December American regulators started the process of auctioning off radio-frequency bands needed to roll out superfast fifth-generation mobile networks. Industry experts had expected bids to come in at $25bn-3obn between them, less than the $45bn fetched in the last big 4G spectrum sale in 2015-but a tidy sum nonetheless.
In fact, when the first part of the auction was concluded on December 23rd, the bids had reached a staggering $7obn. The winners will be on the hook for ""clearing costs of another $ubn-i5bn, in part to compensate satellite firms for giving up some of their spectrum that is particularly wellsuited for 5G. The auction will resume on January 4th. By the time it ends, the proceeds may exceed $9obn.
At first blush, this seems like a classic case of overbidding by zealous telecoms firms chasing a shiny new technology. It could leave at&t and Verizon, America's mobile-telephony giants, saddled with huge debts. New Street Research, a firm of analysts, reckons that the industry's overall debt will be between $45bn and $6obn higher than previously forecast.
There is an alternative view, however. As Jonathan Chaplin of New Street puts it, ""it is almost impossible for carriers to overpay for this spectrum. This case rests on three arguments.
First, the specific frequencies on offer give firms their best chance to get ""large swathes of contiguous spectrum needed for 5G to realise its full potential, points out Tom Wheeler, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the agency supervising the auction. These frequencies, clustered around 3GHz, enable transmission speeds ten times higher than 4G. The current, pseudo-5G offerings in lower frequencies are often barely faster than 4G connections. The new spectrum also supports 20-25% more capacity than bands of 2GHZ or lower.
The second justification for splurging on spectrum is to defend market share. tMobile, America's third-biggest provider, leapt ahead in 5G thanks to its recent acquisition of Sprint, a smaller rival endowed with desirable frequencies. For at&t and Verizon the auction was ""do or die, as one analyst puts it. For its part, Т-Mobile may be entering stalking-horse bids to ensure bigger rivals do not win chunks of spectrum for a pittance. As Mr Wheeler notes, firms are asking ""How do I keep my competitor from getting an advantage over me through his spectrum position?
And competition is not confined to wireless rivals. Comcast and Charter, two large cable-television firms, have formed a joint venture to bid on 5G spectrum in the hope of taking on the incumbents. Dish Network, a big satellite-TV provider, is also taking part in the auction. Walter Piecyk of LightShed Partners, a research firm, adds that the bids are soaring because earlier, futile efforts at using inferior frequencies have left America far behind China, its main strategic rival, in the 5G race.
The final factor fuelling the bidding war is cheap money. Mr Piecyk reckons an extra $iobn in bids costs just $5oom a year to finance at today's rock-bottom interest rates, which telecoms giants can easily afford. Or as Dish's boss, Charlie Ergen, puts it more colourfully: ""They are printing money, but they aren't making more spectrum."

The expensive battle to be the Netflix of audio
ABOVE THE din of chat-shows, dramas and documentaries streamed to blaring voice-activated speakers, a louder sound can be heard: ker-ching. On December 29th Spotify, an audio-streaming service, aired the first in a series of exclusive podcasts by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. A few weeks earlier the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was in talks to buy Wondery, a producer of popular podcasts including ""Dirty John"" and ""Dr Death"", for $3oom. The tech giant, which got into podcasting only in September, has also signed up expensive stars such as Will Smith and dj Khaled.
The deals are the latest in an industrywide spree. Last year Daniel Ek, Spotify's boss, declared that ""audio-not just music-would be the future"" of his firm. Since then Spotify has been on a billion-dollar podcasting binge, acquiring production and ad-tech firms such as Gimlet, Anchor and Megaphone, as well as shows; in May it paid $ioom for ""The Joe Rogan Experience"". Apple, the biggest podcast distributor, has bought Scout fm, a podcasting app, and signed up stars like Oprah Winfrey.
Podcasting makes most of its money through ads, which last year generated revenue of just $i.3bn, according to Omdia, a data firm-equal to 6% or so of the recorded-music industry's sales, or the box-office takings of one Hollywood blockbuster. Why the big noise about a small business?
One reason is growth. Global podcast listeners will exceed 2bn by 2o25, Omdia reckons, from 8oom in 2oi9. Ad sales may nearly treble, to $3.5bn. As giants hoover up shows, advertisers put off by fragmentation can buy many spots in one place.
Second, podcasts give audio-streamers a chance to own content, which they cannot do with music. Most of the world's tunes are owned by three record labels, which skim off about 70% of the streamers' revenues. No matter how much they grow, firms like Spotify find their costs grow with them. The fixed cost of acquiring a podcast means that growth can boost margins.
Last, the ability to own podcasts gives streaming services a way to differentiate themselves. In contrast to video-streamers, which compete on content, Spotify, Amazon and Apple offer roughly the same library of 40m songs. Artists, who see streaming mainly as a way to promote their more profitable live shows, have little incentive to be exclusive to one service. Original podcasts are a way to lure fans.
If their valuation model for podcasts is based on music catalogues, the streamers may be overpaying for some of them. Will Page, a former Spotify chief economist, notes that whereas back catalogues like Bob Dylan's, recently sold to Universal Music Group, are valuable because the songs are replayed for years, podcasts are perishable. ""A podcast about Dylan is of its time; a Dylan song is timeless,"" he says.
Spotify's move into podcasting has helped its share price double this year. But rivals like Apple and Amazon, which offer bundles of audio, video, gaming and more, can attract stars with promises of a spin-off tv show or game. Tech giants can also lean on hardware: iPhones come with Apple's podcast app and Amazon's speakers default to Amazon Music. The battle for consumers' ears is only likely to get noisier."

THE YEAR 2020 put worker morale to the test. It did not help that many employees were unable to enjoy a normal holiday, or had to change their plans. For Bartleby, two sun-drenched weeks in Spain were converted into a wet week in Cornwall, marked by an attempt to eat a pasty on the beach in the face of a sudden hailstorm. Finding a restaurant was virtually impossible because of the high demand created by the British government's ""eat out to help out"" scheme.
Like many people, Bartleby is left with unused annual leave. But he is lucky that The Economist is a benign employer, willing to let him carry over a couple of weeks. Not every company can afford to be so kind. The occasional loss of a business columnist is not much of a handicap. Things are rather different when the employee is the client manager for the firm's largest customer or the production manager at a microprocessor plant.
The more vital the worker, the more likely they will have been to be asked to postpone their annual leave in the pandemic. This may leave employers with headaches in the coming year as workers catch up before their unused holiday is lost. Brian Kropp of Gartner, a consultancy, expects to see the lion's share of staff shortages to land in the first half of 2021.
For multinational firms, the different rules and customs that apply across the world further complicate things. America lacks federal laws that guarantee workers vacation time; rules are down to individual states. Even when Americans do get a holiday allowance, 55% of them do not use all of it, according to a survey from 2018. In Japan only 52% of workers took all their paid leave that year.
Unlike their European peers, American and Japanese workers seem to succumb to social pressure: the fear that taking vacation reflects a lack of commitment to their job (or reveals their dispensability). Many American states also allow companies to impose a ""use it or lose it"" policy, under which they can insist employees cannot carry over unused leave into the following year. That may have prompted a lot of workers to take an extended Christmas break to avoid the loss of their precious allowance.
Still, wise employers may want to allow a little flexibility after what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is no good forcing people to turn up for work if, in the process, you inflict permanent damage on their well-being. Indeed, the evidence seems to suggest that workers put in extra effort in 2020, with those working from home adding an extra hour to their work day. They avoided the agonies of commuting but also lost the clear separation of work from home life, which probably added to stress. Some will have spent a ""staycation"" at home-which does not offer an invigorating change of scenery or routine for those who have been confined within the same four walls since March.
So there is a balance to be struck by employers between the need for adequate staffing and the need to keep on good terms with hard-working employees. In some countries, governments have intervened on workers' behalf. Under Britain's working-time regulations, employees were already entitled to carry eight days of leave over to the following year, if the employer agreed in advance. The rules were amended in 2020 to take account of covid-19, so a further four weeks could be carried over into 202iand even 2022. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, an association of hr managers, says this means that, in theory, workers can roll over all five weeks of leave from 2020. In Denmark the rules were changed to allow workers to roll over their unused holiday entitlements into 2021.
In Belgium companies often allow employees to carry over five days of leave but they have to be used by the end of March. Doug Gerke of Willis Towers Watson, a benefits consultant, says that many employers are willing to give workers even more flexibility. Likewise, he says, many European companies may have an official ""use it or lose it"" policy, but in practice they are reluctant to confront workers over the issue.
Mr Kropp says that some firms are asking employees to commit to the amount of leave they are planning to take in the first quarter of 2021, the better to forecast the staffing challenges they face. Others are extending ""use it or lose it"" deadlines to parcel out any absences over a longer period. Once the vaccines are distributed and travel is possible again airports could see a Gadarene rush. In 2021 managing people when they are not working will be just as important as managing them when they are."

Governments and investors hope to stoke a global infrastructure boom, but they are terrible at making projects happen. Can that change?
IN THE 1920s the Lambert Flying Field in St Louis, Missouri, was a hive of innovation and celebrity. It became the first airport with a traffic-control system, waving flags at pilots. Charles Lindbergh flew airmail from it before making the first solo flight across the Atlantic. Today the airport is old, obscure and drab. So in 2017 it joined an experimental privatisation scheme, a key plank of President Donald Trump's effort to revamp America's infrastructure. By 2019, according to a confidential note seen by The Economist, a project to modernise it had attracted 18 bids from the great and good of the infrastructure-investment industry.
At the end of that year, however, the mayor of St Louis abruptly cancelled the project. Four days later the privatisation of the Jacksonville electric utility, in Florida, was also pulled, derailing another big public-private partnership (ppp). In both cases investors had spent tens of millions of dollars preparing bids. For one, the double whammy symbolises all that is wrong with America's infrastructure procurement. ""It's Lucy and the football,"" he says, referring to a character in Peanuts, a comic strip, who torments Charlie Brown by holding a ball out to him, only to pull away as he goes to kick it, so he always falls on his bottom.
Such unpredictability could come back to bite governments, just as they promise an infrastructure boom. America's president-elect, Joe Biden, has pledged to spend $2trn on roads, bridges and electric-car charging points. Green projects make up 30% of the European Union's €75obn ($9i8bn) recovery fund. China has set aside iotrn yuan ($i.5trn) for new projects, and many Latin American and Asian governments plan to splurge. Yet most countries have struggled to realise such promises in the past. Can they succeed this time?
Covid-19 may temporarily divert funds: governments may need to bail out struggling urban-transport systems, for instance, meaning there is less to spend on other projects. But the pandemic also explains governments' enthusiasm for infrastructure: it can boost growth, both in the near term and further out. According to the IMF, increasing public investment by 1% of GDP across advanced and emerging economies would create 20m-33m jobs and lift GDP by 0.25-0.5% in the first year, and up to four times that after the second. It's about finding ""quick wins"", says Catherine McKenna, the infrastructure minister in Canada, which is bringing forward some of its 12-year, C$180bn ($140bn) plan, to create jobs. In the long term, spending could remove supply-side bottlenecks and make the economy more resilient to shocks.
It helps that, in the rich world, interest rates are low, allowing governments to finance investment sprees. And pension funds and insurers, starved of the safe yield they need to meet future liabilities, are eyeing the steady cashflows from infrastructure assets. Rajiv Shah, who runs the Rockefeller Foundation, which recently committed $1bn to renewables and health projects, says these forces together create an opportunity to ""reshape the modern economy in many parts of the world"".
This new faith in infrastructure is taking two forms. First, governments are fasttracking funds for maintenance and upgrades. These have the advantage of being shovel-ready projects that do not get en- snared in long procurement processes, says Jean Bensai'd, infrastructure chief at France's finance ministry. One-fifth of his country's €100bn infrastructure plan aims to make buildings energy-efficient, revamp transport links and bolster care facilities. Moreover, the pool of potential projects is vast. Catching up on America's backlog of highway and bridge repairs, for example, would cost 3.5% of its gdp.
The second type of spending is on new capabilities. The pandemic's effect on remote working and e-commerce has shown the need for investing in digital infrastructure, such as fibre networks or data centres. McKinsey, a consultancy, estimates spending on these must rise by 6-11% annually over the next decade to match growing usage. Money is also going towards green projects, such as offshore-wind and electrictransport infrastructure.
All this is good news, given vast unmet needs. The Global Infrastructure Hub, a unit of the G20, reckons the world will need $82trn of investment, in 2015 prices, by 2040. Based on trends at the end of 2019 it will muster $69trn. Yet, keen as governments and investors are this time, they have struggled to get projects going before.
Signal failures
Infrastructure investment has been flagging for years. Public and private spending on ""economic"" infrastructure-transport, utilities and telecoms-fell from 3.8% of global gdp in 2013 to around 3.4% in 2019, reckons McKinsey. Spending on ""social"" infastructure, a measure that includes schools and hospitals, has also declined.
The long view looks worse. In rich countries public investment, a proxy for infrastructure investment by governments, has declined from an average of 2.4% of gdp in the 1990s to less than 2% after 2010-a historic low, says Manal Fouad of the imf. It has fallen in emerging economies too (see chart 1). Wear and tear means the publiccapital stock has not kept pace with the economy. In the rich world, for instance, the stock, as a share of gdp, has fallen by nearly ten percentage points since 1992.
China is an exception. In 2019 it spent $1.3trn on economic infrastructure-more than America and western Europe combined. Its public-capital stock rose from 154% of gdp in 1992 to 165% in 2017.
Not all of its spending was wise, though. In 2016 experts at Oxford University found that over half of its infrastructure investments ""destroyed"" economic value. Many generated less revenue than their cost of borrowing, leaving local governments with huge losses. The government has since sought to limit waste. Yet the jury is still out on whether the splurge was ""economically destructive in aggregate"", says Michael Bennon of Stanford University.
The story in America, by contrast, is one of too little spending. In 2017, the latest year for which figures are available, federal, state and local spending on infrastructure was 2.3% of gdp-a record low. Although some economists argue that America's roads are not in a bad way, other areas, from bridges to broadband, need serious funding. Even a partial shutdown of the 111-yearold Hudson River rail tunnel in New York, say, could cost the economy $16bn over four years, according to the Regional Plan Association, a think-tank.
Political rows over execution have been a big obstacle. President Barack Obama's Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which earmarked $133bn for infrastructure and energy projects in 2009, failed to greatly expand the capital stock, largely because it focused on small maintenance projects that could pass through Congress. Mr Trump's $200bn plan was hobbled by disagreements over the distribution of cash.
Some hoped institutional capital could plug the gap. Worldwide, over 16,500 private infrastructure transactions have closed since 2015, with a big chunk done through specialist funds. These have raised $710bn since 2008, according to Infrastructure Investor, a trade publication. A record $220bn is still unspent. Surveys suggest investors want to commit yet more cash. Annual returns, at an average of 9% since 2010, have been good; meanwhile, commercial property, a rival alternative to bonds, has been rocked by lockdowns.
The trouble is that most private investors prefer milking existing assets to building new ones: ""secondary"" deals have made up four-fifths of the total value of their infrastructure transactions in recent years (see chart 2). ppps have fizzled. When these took off in the 1990s they were seen as offering the best of the public and private worlds. As investors put up the cash, governments did not need to fork out capital upfront, yet could still regulate the service and gain control of the assets at the end of the contract. Outside expertise, it was hoped, would lead to speedier execution. Investors, for their part, would gain from the state's ability to bear big risks, through subsidised insurance or guarantees.
Yet in Britain, the birthplace of the idea, the value of new ppps fell to next to nothing in 2017. Even India, the world's top recipient of private investment in ppps in 2008-12, has hit the brakes. Critics lambast them as being ""too expensive, opaque, slow and rigid"", says Georg Inderst, an adviser on infrastructure to institutional investors. Worldwide, private investment in new ppps fell to $30bn in 2019, from $55bn in 2010 (see chart 3 on next page).
Why has building infrastructure been so hard? Experts point to three longstanding stumbling blocks: politics, poor execution and precarious funding. Start with politics. In democracies the need to unlock public funds, or reward private capital, means governments must run transparent, years-long processes that can overlap with several electoral cycles. ""To proceed, a ppp needs hundreds if not thousands of supporters; but a handful of people can kill it,"" says the infrastructure boss of a Wall Street firm. Ideological shifts can derail entire programmes. After entering office in 2018, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's president, cancelled most publicly tendered energy projects, preferring to work through state-owned utilities instead.
A second problem is faulty execution. Many governments lack the skills or will to marshall projects. Hans-Martin Aerts of APG, a Dutch pension fund with €538bn in assets, laments a lack of ""bankable deal-flow"": grand announcements are seldom followed by detailed lists of projects. Misaligned incentives and poor monitoring often cause costs to swell. Nine out of ten mega-projects overrun their budget and schedule-by an average 70% and 61%, respectively. Harsh terms can lead bidders to accept wafer-thin margins and shoulder too much risk, prompting them to cut corners. Investors in Britain's Royal Liverpool Hospital lost their shirts after Carillion, its main contractor, collapsed in 2018. ""It was in such bad shape, so badly built, that it was not viable,"" says Paul Smith of cms, a law firm that tried to rescue the ppp.
Even when projects are completed, governments can move the goalposts. Frank Kwok of Macquarie, a bank that held a stake in an Asian airport group, says unstable regulation in some areas can create uncertainty for investors. Delayed increases to fees charged by airports in India, for instance, have made such investments seem risky, despite booming traffic.
A third reason why infrastructure plans are so hard to realise lies in the capital structure of many ""greenfield"" projects. They are often highly leveraged and dominated by construction firms, which want to sell out in two or three years, rather than long-term investors. Thin equity layers, coupled with short exit windows, leave little buffer to absorb shocks, says David Neal of ifm Investors, an asset manager owned by Australian pension funds. Rosy revenue forecasts worsen matters.
At first glance, none of this bodes well for the latest infrastructure craze. Yet governments and investors are wising up to common pitfalls, suggesting that past failures need not be repeated. No country has been perfect, but each could learn from the others. Governments could lure capital by tailoring contracts to provide more certainty. In 2009, for example, Britain started tendering the huge cables that link offshore wind farms to the coast, under a regime that gives investors a guaranteed return on costs. At the start ""there were about four people in the room,"" says Gavin Tait of Amber Infrastructure, a fund manager. ""Now there are hundreds."" Elsewhere, bundling tiny projects under standardised contracts helps lower costs, says Matthieu Muzumdar of Meridiam, an asset manager.
Other countries strive to protect projects from politics. Canada has set up an arm's-length infrastructure bank, which crafts innovative financing schemes with the private sector. That has galvanised interest from American and British investors, says Ms McKenna, the minister. Australia's ""asset-recycling"" programme provided political cover for lucrative privatisations. Between 2014 and 2019, its federal government offered a 15% top-up to states selling assets if they used the proceeds to finance new projects.
Governments that start small and keep their word seem to whet investors' appetite for more ambitious plans. Colombia's road-concession scheme, which began in the 1990s, has lured in an expanding cast of international funds and developers. The fifth iteration, which will spend $15bn and also covers airports, is ""the largest in Colombia's history"", says Manuel Felipe Gutiérrez, who runs its infrastructure agency.
Smarter procurement is being matched by more enthusiasm from investors. It helps that digital and renewable assets are friendlier to private capital. There is a stronger political imperative to build them: whereas few people march to upgrade a road, climate change draws millions, says Jim Barry of BlackRock, an asset manager. They are often profitable, and so rely less on fickle state support. Most big wind and solar farms no longer need subsidies; the roll-out of 5G networks is financed by telecoms firms. And they are easier to build. Investors usually stay away from mega-projects because they are mind-bogglingly complex, but controlling costs on ""mini-projects"" like data centres is a piece of cake, says Adam Petrie of amp Capital.
Accordingly, investment has boomed. Connor Teskey of Brookfield, another asset manager, says its renewables portfolio has doubled over the past five years, to $5obn. Altogether the sector makes up 57% of infrastructure deals, up from 40% in 2010, according to Preqin, a data provider. The share of telecoms has tripled, to 9.3%.
The biggest change, though, is that investors are savvier. Once buyers of boring assets in secondary markets, the largest pension funds now want to build their own. This is partly out of necessity. As more capital goes towards infrastructure, brownfield assets attract fierce competition, making it hard to meet allocation targets. In 2013, for instance, cdpq, a Canadian pension fund, acquired a portfolio of wind farms from Invenergy, an American developer. It then bought the firm itself, becoming America's second-biggest wind-farm developer, and has taken on Montreal's light-rail project. After snapping up Plenary Americas, a ppp developer, in March, it aims to double its portfolio to $60bn by 2025, mostly by building assets, says Emmanuel Jaclot, its infrastructure chief.
Winds of change
Investors are also paying attention to innovation. Macquarie, for instance, monitors new technology; it recently helped Cadent, a British gas-distribution firm that it owns, conduct pilot projects to inject hydrogen into its pipe network. Other investors are seeding joint ventures. Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners (sip), a firm backed by Google and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, seeks to reimagine how cities work. Its first project, in Michigan, is a prototype of the road of the future, using cameras and sensors to fill the ""dead space"" between buses and trams with autonomous vehicles, says Jonathan Winer, its co-founder. Another involves ""virtual"" power plants that pay people to lower heating or dim their lights.
Smarter ways to invest, then, could help governments and investors realise their infrastructure ambitions this time. Still, projects can occasionally be wrecked. A cautionary tale comes from Sidewalk Labs, the Google unit from which sip was spun out. In 2017 it was chosen to redevelop Toronto's waterfront. The plan had involved heated pavements and connected devices to monitor traffic-before local opposition killed it in May 2020. Investors and developers can look forward to landing on their backsides less often than Charlie Brown. But they can still be caught out."

Will enduring unemployment slow America's economic recovery?
ONE OF THE biggest questions facing the world economy in 2021 is how fast America's labour market will recover. Optimists point to the rapid decline in the unemployment rate after the first wave of the pandemic-from nearly 15% in April to 6.7% in November-as a reason for a speedy recovery. Pessimists' go-to statistic is the high and rising rate of the long-term unemployed, those who have been out of work for more than six months. It has risen from 0.7% of the labour force in February to 2.5% today. The last time the figure was that high was in December 2013, when the labour market was recovering from the global financial crisis of 2007-09.
On average, the longer someone is unemployed, the harder it is for them to find work. In part that may be because the least productive workers, for whom the labour market is always an unwelcoming place, are more likely to experience long spells of unemployment during downturns. But spending months on the sofa also causes people's skills to atrophy. As a result, recessions inflict lasting scars on both workers and the economy.
How deep are the scars likely to be this time? Unemployment fell rapidly in 2020-and much more quickly than after the financial crisis-because millions of laid-off workers were recalled to their jobs in the summer and autumn. This was particularly true of jobs requiring face-to-face contact. Analysis by The Economist suggests that service occupations accounted for about a third of the jobs lost in the spring and about a third of the subsequent rebound. Employment among those aged 20-24, who might often work as waiters and bar staff, has recovered nearly 80% of its losses (see chart).
The picture for the long-term unemployed is less rosy, though. Nearly 30% of them say they are only temporarily laid off, but with each passing month it seems less likely that their jobs will return. The longterm unemployed are also more evenly spread across the economy. Service workers make up just over a quarter of the rise in long-term unemployment since February. Remarkably, though, they are outnumbered by professionals and managers. These account for a third of the recent rise in long-term unemployment, even though they are often said to have been immune to the downturn. Nor are the newly long-term unemployed especially young. More than half are over 45. Most are men. They look like a group that has suffered a normal recession rather than a service-sector hiatus.
Things appear gloomier still when you consider those who left the workforce altogether in the spring, meaning they stopped working and did not look for new jobs. Such ""inactive"" workers are not counted as unemployed. Jason Furman and Wilson Powell III of Harvard University reckon that a ""realistic"" unemployment rate, which adds many of them back in, is 8.5%. A study of the long-term unemployed by Alan Krueger of Princeton University, Judd Cramer of Harvard University and David Cho of the Federal Reserve in 2014 found that, counterintuitively, the long-term unemployed leave the workforce more readily during recoveries than in downturns; they seem to discover they are missing out on the rebound, and give up looking for work. If the same holds in 2021, labour-force participation could fall further.
The pessimists therefore have plenty of ammunition. Yet the optimists can fire back. Some 3.9m of the 5.7m people who have left the labour force since January cite the pandemic as the reason they are not looking for work, calculates Joseph Briggs of Goldman Sachs, a bank. Once it ends, they may return. In the years after Messrs Krueger, Cramer and Cho published their study, America's labour market heated up so much that employers searched far and wide for willing workers, hiring even exconvicts, and the labour-force participation rate for 16- to 64-year-olds went up. If the economy recovers quickly enough, then its scars will probably heal. Some economists predict a spending spree in 2021 as the economy reopens fully and pent-up demand is unleashed.
But what must come first, the consumer-spending rebound, or labour-market healing? Lawmakers may have solved the chicken-and-egg problem. On December 27th President Donald Trump signed a bill that will inject $900bn (4.3% of gdp) in stimulus, sending cheques to households and extending benefits for the long-term unemployed (see United States section). The replacement of lost incomes could allow the unemployed to spend even as they search for work. And a rapid rise in consumption in 2021 should bring the labour market back to the boil-even, eventually, for the long-term unemployed."

THERE ARE both petty and respectable explanations for China's assault on Ant Group. The fintech giant was less than 48 hours away from the world's biggest initial public offering when regulators halted it in November-the first in a series of moves aimed at taming the fast-growing firm. The petty is that Jack Ma, Ant's outspoken founder, had offended Chinese leaders with a blunt speech. The respectable is that the government needed to act because Ant threatened financial stability. As a state newspaper recently put it, Ant had become ""too big to fail"", presenting itself as a tech firm but pumping out loans. The petty explanation, to the extent that it is right, can be dismissed as a China-specific problem, a reflection of the Communist Party's tightening grip on tycoons. But the respectable explanation deserves a hearing, not least because of its global resonance. As Apple, Facebook and Google get into payments and more, the question of how to regulate Big Tech on its forays into finance will become all the more prominent.
The main charge against Ant is that it offers what can be described as consumer subprime with tech characteristics. Its model is to identify small borrowers-both individuals and businesses- and supply them with credit from banks. Ant's customers only ever interact with its sleek app, yet it is an intermediary. It provides funding for just 2% of the value of the loans it distributes, with the rest coming from banks and other firms. Ant, in effect, serves as their agent, feeding them a constant stream of clients. The concern therefore is that, like subprime-mortgage originators in America in the early 2000s, Ant does not have enough skin in the game. What would stop it from lending carelessly? China's response includes a draft rule that would require Ant to fund 30% of its loans, which would force it to hold more capital and slow it down. On December 27th the central bank also told Ant to return to its roots as a payments firm, a low-margin, low-risk business.
At first glance such measures may seem prudent. But there is a strong case to be made that lighter regulation would be the better approach. For a start, the parallel with subprime mortgages is not very good. Most of Ant's loans are small (as little as 20 yuan, or $3, for consumers), with a tenor of just a few months or so, and spread across many sectors. It thus relies on a constant churning of credit. If bad loans surge, banks can scale back almost instantly. That is a far cry from subprime mortgages, much larger loans that ran for many years and were, by definition, all tied to the property market.
Given how new fintech still is, detailed studies of its impact have emerged only recently. They highlight another problem with excessive regulation: fintech is good for the economy, and smothering it could limit its potential. Three points stand out. First, fintech firms reach borrowers under-served by banks. As banks normally vet loans on a case-by-case basis, they prefer large, established clients. Fintech firms go for just the opposite. Harold Hau of the University of Geneva and other researchers examined Ant's loan offers to 2.9m vendors on an e-commerce site. They found that 39% of vendors with low credit scores in cities with low amounts of bank lending accepted Ant's offers, as against only 17% of those with high credit scores in cities with more bank lending.
A similar pattern exists elsewhere. Researchers at the Bank for International Settlements (bis) looked at 79 countries during 2013-19. Where banking sectors were less competitive and banks had less incentive to pursue smaller clients, fintech lenders grew larger. They also seem less likely to discriminate by race. A study of America's mortgage market found that minority customers had similar rejection rates to white ones when using fintech firms, but 6% more rejections than white people via face-to-face lenders.
As valuable as inclusion is, it would not prove sustainable if a large share of fintech credit went bad. Hence the importance of the second point: the bedrock of data and algorithms on which it is built. Ant, for one, includes hundreds of variables in its credit model, from users' friend networks to their consumption patterns. Before the pandemic, the delinquency rate on its loans to small businesses was about 2%, compared with 6% for banks. In a paper from 2019, Jon Frost, then of the Financial Stability Board, and other economists turned to a hard case-Argentina-to test the hypothesis that fintech firms have an information advantage over banks. Sure enough, they did. The loss rate for Mercado Libre, an e-commerce firm, on loans to high-risk clients was 2.8%, about the same as banks' loss rate on their best small-business clients.
Lastly, far from endangering the economy, fintech lending may actually bolster its resilience. Leonardo Gambacorta of the bis and others have examined more than 2m Chinese firms that borrowed from both Ant and conventional banks. Bank credit was closely tied to local house prices; loan officers trust it both as collateral and as a shorthand for gauging economic health. Fintech credit was uncorrelated with house prices and instead linked to measures of business health such as transaction volumes. The upshot is that in a housing downturn, banks tighten credit to small firms, worsening economic pressure. By contrast, without property as collateral, fintech lending may be more stable, limiting contagion.
Friend or foe?
None of this is to deny that fintech could give rise to new problems. In making credit easily available, consumers can end up with too much debt. Firms may misuse the data they hoover up. Regulators must be vigilant against fraud, which plagued China's peer-to-peer lending industry a few years ago. And for well-run firms, monopoly is a serious risk. Once big enough, Ant could use its market power to block competitors and extract more profits.
Perspective is needed, though. Fintech is still in its infancy. Ant is by far the biggest of the upstarts globally, but the outstanding value of all the loans it has arranged amounts to less than 1% of the total assets held by China's commercial banks. At this stage prudent regulators would not rein it in, but give it room to run."

SARS-COV-2 is following the evolutionary rule book to perfection
NATURAL SELECTION is a powerful force. In circumstances that are still disputed, it took a bat coronavirus and adapted it to people instead. The result has spread around the globe. Now, in two independent but coincidental events, it has modified that virus still further, creating new variants which are displacing the original versions. It looks possible that one or other of these novel viruses will itself soon become a dominant form of sars-cov-2.
Knowledge of both became widespread in mid-December. In Britain, a set of researchers called the Covid-19 Genomics uk Consortium (cog-uk) published the genetic sequence of variant B.1.1.7, and nervtag, a group that studies emerging viral threats, advised the government that this version of the virus was 67-75% more transmissible than those already circulating in the country. In South Africa, meanwhile, Salim Abdool Kalim, a leading epidemiologist, briefed the country on all three television channels about a variant called 501.v2 which, by then, was accounting for almost 90% of new covid-19 infections in the province of Western Cape.
Britain responded on December 19th, by tightening restrictions already in place. South Africa's response came on December 28th, in the wake of its millionth recorded case of the illness, with measures that extended a night-time curfew by two hours and reimposed a ban on the sale of alcohol. Other countries have reacted by discouraging even more forcefully than before any travel between themselves and Britain and South Africa. At least in the case of B.1.1.7, though, this has merely shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. That variant has now been detected in a score of countries besides Britain-and from these new sites, or from Britain, it will spread still further. Isolated cases of 501V2 outside South Africa have been reported, too, from Australia, Britain, Japan and Switzerland.
So far, the evidence suggests that despite their extra transmissibility, neither new variant is more dangerous on a case-by-case basis than existing versions of the virus. In this, both are travelling the path predicted by evolutionary biologists to lead to long-term success for a new pathogen-which is to become more contagious (which increases the chance of onward transmission) rather than more deadly (which reduces it). And the speed with which they have spread is impressive.
The first sample of B.1.1.7 was collected on September 20th, to the south-east of London. The second was found the following day in London itself. A few weeks later, at the beginning of November, B.1.1.7 accounted for 28% of new infections in London. By the first week of December that had risen to 62%. It is probably now above 90%.
Variant 501.V2 has a similar history. It began in the Eastern Cape, the first samples dating from mid-October, and has since spread to other coastal provinces.
The rapid rise of B.1.1.7 and 501.v2 raises several questions. One is why these particular variants have been so successful. A second is what circumstances they arose in. A third is whether they will resist any of the new vaccines in which such store is now being placed.
The answers to the first of these questions lie in the variants' genomes. COG-UK's investigation of B.1.1.7 shows that it differs meaningfully from the original version of SARS-cov-2 in 17 places. That is a lot. Moreover, several of these differences are in the gene for spike, the protein by which coronaviruses attach themselves to their cellular prey. Three of the spike mutations particularly caught the researchers' eyes.
One, N501Y, affects the 501st link in spike's amino-acid chain. This link is part of a structure called the receptor-binding domain, which stretches from links 319 to 541. It is one of six key contact points that help lock spike onto its target, a protein called ace2 which occurs on the surface membranes of certain cells lining the airways of the lungs. The letters in the mutation's name refer to the replacement of an amino acid called asparagine (""n"", in biological shorthand) by one called tyrosine (""y""). That matters because previous laboratory work has shown that the change in chemical properties which this substitution causes binds the two proteins together more tightly than normal. Perhaps tellingly, this particular mutation (though no other) is shared with 501.V2.
Golden spike
B.1.1.7's other two intriguing spike mutations are 69-70del, which knocks two amino acids out of the chain altogether, and P681H, which substitutes yet another amino acid, histidine, for one called proline at chain-link 681. The double-deletion attracted the researchers' attention for several reasons, not the least being that it was also found in a viral variant which afflicted some farmed mink in Denmark in November, causing worries about an animal reservoir of the disease developing. The substitution is reckoned significant because it is at one end of a part of the protein called the S1/S2 furin-cleavage site (links 681-688), which helps activate spike in preparation for its encounter with the target cell. This site is absent from the spike proteins of related coronaviruses, such as the original sars, and may be one reason why SARS-COV-2 is so infective.
The South African variant, 501.v2, has only three meaningful mutations, and all are in spike's receptor-binding domain. Besides N501Y, they are K417N and E484K (k and E are amino acids called lysine and glutamic acid). These two other links are now the subject of intense scrutiny.
Even three meaningful mutations is quite a lot for a variant to have. Just one would be more usual. The 17 found in B.1.1.7 therefore constitute a huge anomaly. How this plethora of changes came together in a single virus is thus the second question which needs an answer.
The authors of the cog-uk paper have a suggestion. This is that, rather than being a chance accumulation of changes, B.1.1.7 might itself be the consequence of an evolutionary process-but one that happened in a single human being rather than a population. They observe that some people develop chronic covid-19 infections because their immune systems do not work properly and so cannot clear the infection. These unfortunates, they hypothesise, may act as incubators for novel viral variants.
The theory goes like this. At first, such a patient's lack of natural immunity relaxes pressure on the virus, permitting the multiplication of mutations which would otherwise be culled by the immune system. However, treatment for chronic covid-19 often involves what is known as convalescent plasma. This is serum gathered from recovered covid patients, which is therefore rich in antibodies against sars-cov-2. As a therapy, that approach frequently works. But administering such a cocktail of antibodies applies a strong selection pressure to what is now a diverse viral population in the patient's body. This, the cog-uk researchers reckon, may result in the success of mutational combinations which would not otherwise have seen the light of day. It is possible that B.1.1.7 is one of these.
The answer to the third question- whether either new variant will resist the vaccines now being rolled out-is ""probably not"". It would be a long-odds coincidence if mutations which spread in the absence of a vaccine nevertheless protected the virus carrying them from the immune response raised by that vaccine.
This is no guarantee for the future, though. The swift emergence of these two variants shows evolution's power. If there is a combination of mutations that can get around the immune response which a vaccine induces, then there is a fair chance that nature will find it."

A new approach may simplify the treatment of snake bites
SNAKE VENOM kills around 140,000 people a year and debilitates roughly 400,000 others. One reason for these large numbers is that every venom needs a specific antivenin to treat it. In places with rich ophidian faunas, dozens of antivenins may therefore need to be kept to hand.
Even if these are available, though, they are no guarantee of success. Someone who has been bitten may not have seen the assailant, or may be an unreliable witness. Only if the snake itself has been caught or killed can medics be sure what they are dealing with.
To make things worse still, administering the wrong antivenin may not merely be useless, but dangerous, for incorrect treatment sometimes provokes a further adverse reaction. In addition, antivenins themselves, which are made by injecting snake venom into large, robust animals such as horses and then collecting serum containing the antibodies generated, have to be kept refrigerated. Unfortunately, many of the tropical areas in which venomous snakes are abundant and diverse are also those where continuous supplies of electricity for refrigeration cannot be taken for granted. And, to cap things off, antivenins must be injected rather than being taken orally, so the person doing the injecting requires at least a modicum of training.
This, then, is a field that seems ripe for disruption. An ideal antivenin should be universal, thermally stable and orally administered. All three of these desiderata suggest abandoning the antibody approach and trying instead to find small-molecule drugs that will do the job. And disruption may be at hand in the person of Nicholas Casewell of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, in Britain. As he reports in Nature Communications, Dr Case-well thinks he has found an antidote that is indeed stable and orally administered. It is not, admittedly, universal. But it does seem to work against the toxins of an entire family of snakes-the Viperidae, or vipers- that are responsible for more than half of snakebite deaths.
Though viper venoms, like those of other snakes, vary between species, they have a common theme. Roughly half the toxins in them belong to one of two groups of en- zymes-the Zn2+ metalloproteinases or the phospholipase A2s. It is these enzymes in particular that seem responsible for the extensive tissue damage and haemorrhaging which make viper bites so deadly. Drugs that mop up or neutralise Zn2+ metalloproteinases and phospholipase A2s might thus act as effective antivenins for viper bites. So Dr Casewell and his colleagues decided to look for some.
A search of the literature yielded three promising candidates. One, varespladib, is an inhibitor of phospholipase A2s used to treat a range of inflammatory diseases. The second, marimastat, was once tested as an anticancer agent. It proved ineffective for that purpose, but did inhibit circulation of Zn2+ metalloproteinases. The third, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (dmps), is employed to treat heavy-metal poisoning and is good at eliminating Zn2+ metalloproteinases.
To test their findings, Dr Casewell and his team injected a group of mice with venoms from a range of Viperidae that often kill people. These included saw-scaled vipers from west Africa and South Asia; Russell's viper, also from South Asia; the African puff adder; and the fer-de-lance from Central America. They left some mice to their fate, as controls. The others received one or more of the putative antivenins.
The control mice all died within an hour. Those receiving a single drug did little better. Most keeled over within six hours. Combinations containing dmps were patchily effective, protecting against some venoms but not others. But mice dosed with a combination of varespladib and marimastat lived on indefinitely.
That is encouraging. And both varespladib and marimastat are thermally stable and have passed human safety trials as lone prescriptions, so testing them in combination on people should be easier than if they were fresh out of a laboratory.
There is still, however, a fair amount of lab work to be done before any such trial might be contemplated. In particular, the experiments so far have injected the drugs rather than administering them orally. Though they are given by mouth when offered to people for other purposes, their efficacy against snake venom when delivered this way would need to be established. But if the therapy Dr Casewell and his colleagues hope they have discovered does prove effective in people, then it will greatly simplify the treatment of snake bites. In the meantime, they are looking to simplify things still further by doing for another snake family, the Elapidae, what they have done for the Viperidae, and ransacking the pharmacopoeias for promising broad-spectrum treatments. The Elapidae include such charmers as the king cobra and the black mamba. More power, then, to the researchers' elbows."

A possible use for the ultimate waste product
URINE, THOUGH distained by modern society, was once surprisingly useful stuff. Street-facing laundries in ancient Rome had pissoirs attached to them, to encourage passers-by in need of relief to provide, free of charge, a raw material which was then fermented into a degreasing agent. Urine also found employment as a mordant, to assist in the dying of cloth- Scottish tweed was once notorious for smelling of the stuff when it got wet. And urine was, too, a source of potassium nitrate, one of the ingredients of gunpowder.
Now, Chen Wei-Shan of Wageningen University, in the Netherlands, thinks he has found yet another use for urine-and one relevant to today's needs rather than yesterday's. He plans to employ it to create heat without fire from waste wood.
Burning wood is a good source of heat and it can be seen as sound from the point of view of greenhouse gases. That is because the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere came thence in the first place, and would return there anyway if the wood in question were simply allowed to rot. But wood fires also bring environmental disbenefits, for they give off sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and other noxious gases along with that CO2.
Researchers have therefore been looking for ways to release wood's latent heat by composting rather than combustion. Unfortunately, unlike other stuff that is routinely composted (dung and waste food, for example) wood does not, by itself, contain a wide enough range of nutrients to sustain the relevant micro-organisms. To digest it, these bugs need dietary supplements. And those-things like ammonium chloride- are too expensive for everyday use.
But urine is cheap-or would be, if routine ways of collecting it existed. And it contains large quantities of nitrogen and potassium (as its use in gunpowder demonstrates) and also of phosphorus (an element that was, as it happens, discovered by an alchemist trying to extract gold from urine). These are all nutrients which composting bugs need to thrive. So, as he writes in acs Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, Dr Chen decided to give it a go.
To this end, he and his colleagues added urine to kiln-dried ash wood and composted the result in glass bottles. Some of this urine was actually a synthetic version, so that its composition was known precisely. The rest was donated by a 28-year-old man who had been medication-free during the previous two years. Both the artificial and the natural urine were diluted, to various degrees, during the process of testing.
The team found that oxygen consumption, wood consumption and heat production all rose rapidly in the jars during the experiment's first week. Once things had settled, though, it was clear natural urine had something going for it which synthetic urine did not. The best synthetic-urine dilution (one part in five parts of water) resulted in a 13% loss of mass of wood after 40 days. The best natural urine dilution (one part in 8.5) brought about a 20% loss.
Why natural urine is more effective than the artificial stuff at the task Dr Chen set it remains unclear. He speculates that it is because natural urine is slightly more acidic, and that this matters to some of the relevant bugs. Which ones in particular, however, he has yet to work out.
Previous experiments suggest that compost-heaps of wood fed suitable nutrients can sustain internal temperatures of 40-55°C for long periods. That is high enough to be useful for heating buildings and, with a bit of a boost, perhaps for providing hot water as well. To commercialise the idea would mean designing a suitable reactor and heat exchanger, but the waste-wood fuel would be cheap. How you would go about gathering the necessary urine in bulk, given the expense of installing a network of suitably dedicated collection points, is not clear. But governments contemplating doing so might be heartened by the fact that, in Rome, the Emperor Vespasian slapped a lucrative tax on the city's urinals-something once commemorated in France by the slang name for an old-fashioned pissoir: ""une vespasienne""."

Four authors consider how covid-19 will change the world

Post Corona. By Scott Galloway. Portfolio; 256 pages; $25. Bantam Press; £18.99
IN ""THE SEVENTH SEAL"", a film by Ingmar Bergman, a knight returns from the crusades to find his homeland ravaged by the plague. Suffering and devastation have shaken his faith in God. When Death comes for him, the crusader proposes a game of chess in order to eke out enough time to commit one act-any act-that might bring meaning amid the pestilence.
In the teeth of a scourge on the scale of covid-19, the impulse to draw significance from suffering is again strong. However, as is clear from the first of what will surely be shelf-loads of books about the coronavirus, in a secular age a pandemic is principally seen not as a question of inscrutable divine will, but as a test of earthly powers.
All these books have to grapple with the problem that they were written amid great uncertainty. Even now much about covid-19 is still unknown-not just when the pandemic will end and what it will leave behind, but also about the nature of the virus itself. These authors are thus attempting to write the review before the final reel has been loaded into the projector.
The most successful is ""Apollo's Arrow"" by Nicholas Christakis, a doctor and sociologist at Yale. He deals with uncertainty by looking back, using history, epidemiology and sociology to put covid-19 in context. This is the book if you want to understand about flattening the curve and herd immunity, or how America's response fell short in those critical early months of the pandemic because of Trumpian politics, bureaucratic turf wars and the failure to create enough reliable testing.
Dr Christakis's title refers to the pestilence that Apollo visited upon the Greeks for enslaving the daughter of a Trojan priest. And, sure enough, he lays out a litany of human failings-chief among them the struggle to learn from the past. Pandemics are an old enemy that has scarred humanity, but once they abate, he writes, people tend to put the search for meaning aside, pick up their lives and party.
Other authors seek to draw more ambitious conclusions. Yet, because they are erecting their arguments on half-built foundations, they risk being highly speculative. Ivan Krastev, for instance, is a Bulgarian political scientist and a master of the brilliant epigram. In his extended essay on covid-19 he observes how ""the strangeness of the pandemic experience is that everything changes but nothing happens"", and how in normal times the elites can afford to travel whereas, ""in the time of covid-19, they can afford to stay at home"".
In between pithy observations, Mr Krastev deals with the theme of whether this disease could be the destruction of the European Union-or perhaps its making. When Italians and Spaniards were dying by the thousand, the eu seemed as relevant as the Holy Roman Empire had been when its subjects were unaware that they were even part of it. He worries that populists, despite having a bad pandemic, will come storming back when it is over. But, he goes on to argue, the virus has also taught Europeans that to be safe in a dangerous world, they must stick together-while the eu's failure has spurred governments to opt for greater integration. Mr Krastev calls this ""the great paradox of covid-19"". Readers may think he is having it both ways.
And yet, if analysts seek to avoid too much speculation, they risk being conventional. That is because when the future is extremely uncertain the safest approach is often to extrapolate from the present.
At least, that is the path taken by Fareed Zakaria, a television host and pundit in America. His ""Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World"" begins with a rousing warning that this pandemic ""is new, upturning many of our daily patterns and presumptions"". But his lessons mostly confirm the things that many commentators-including The Economist-were worrying about before the pandemic: the rivalry between America and China, the potency of the digital revolution and the effects of inequality.
Struggling to be born
Mr Zakaria is a skilful and sober guide on this whistle-stop tour. Along the way, he makes some wise observations: that cities will not fade, because urban life is too rewarding; that globalisation is not dead, because it is too valuable; that experts have their place, so long as they listen to non-experts. But these reasonable points, too, undermine the breathless promise with which the book begins.
Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur and professor at New York University, narrows his field to the coronavirus and business. He conceives of it as a source of disruption and a bringer of rapid change. This allows him to rehearse his theories about the state of business-how products are replacing brands, and how companies are having to choose between selling products at a profit (as Apple does) or selling their users to other businesses (as Google does). Mr Galloway is entertaining and informative on how companies deal with crises, and on the ripeness of health care and university education for disruption. Somehow, though, you get the impression that these were all things he believed before people began to fall ill in a wet market in Wuhan.
One point of agreement among these authors is that government must change- which is also the focus of ""The Wake-Up Call"", written by our former editor, John Micklethwait, and our Bagehot columnist, Adrian Wooldridge. And, indeed, few would be against governments that help create a fairer society while also being more effective and smaller. But that is a manifesto rather than a prediction.
The lesson from Bergman is that, when mankind is faced with great suffering, meaning often lies in small things. At the end of the film, when the knight is on the verge of defeat, he distracts Death fora moment by knocking over the chessboard. This gives a minstrel couple, who in an act of kindness had fed him milk and wild strawberries, the chance to escape with their baby-and live. The post-pandemic world will take time to emerge. Chances are that it will first be found in the details."

Ethio-jazz is a product of migration and heroic ingenuity
TO WESTERN EARS, the music seems both foreign and familiar. Its mood stretches from sultry and haunting to upbeat and vibrant. Soulful Western undertones are audible, yet the overall impression is distinctly and inimitably Ethiopian. Now a rich musical export, the evolution of ""Ethiojazz"", as this hybrid genre is known, and its growing global renown are a tale of back-and-forth migration and the alchemical fusion of ideas. The dramatic saga involves political upheaval, accidental epiphanies, a series of dogged and inspired individuals-and Hollywood.
Today, says Samuel Yirga, a pianist and composer, Ethio-jazz is a calling and way of life for many Ethiopian musicians. In 2020 there were new releases from stars of the genre including Mulatu Astatke (pictured), a visionary percussionist and keyboardist, and Hailu Mergia, an accordionist and band leader. ""Sons of Ethiopia"", a cult classic of 1984 by the band Admas that mixes pop, funk and jazz, has just been re-released. Yet the story of the mesmeric sound began almost a century ago, in Jerusalem.
Visiting that city in 1924, the leader who would later become Emperor Haile Selassie was greeted by a brass band, which was made up of orphaned survivors of the Armenian genocide. He was impressed, and promptly invited the musicians to live in Ethiopia, along with their band leader, Kevork Nalbandian. There the group was known as ""Arba Lijoch"", Amharic for ""The Forty Children"".
The arrival of Arba Lijoch in Addis Ababa was a revolutionary moment in the country's cultural history. An indigenous musical tradition based on stringed instruments began to morph into one revolving around large brass bands. Nalbandian went on to compose the Ethiopian national anthem and to teach musicians from around the country. Later his nephew, Nerses Nalbandian, took on his mission, training performers including future giants of modern Ethiopian music such as Alemayehu Eshete and Tilahun Gessesse, both renowned singers. In Addis Ababa, says Aramazt Kalayjian, a film-maker, the younger Nalbandian is known as ""the godfather"" of modern Ethiopian music.
World music
This formative period was the overture to the pivotal career of Mulatu, the next key figure in the story. Unusually for the era, in the late 1950s Mulatu was educated not in Africa but in Wales, afterwards studying music in London and Boston. But it was in the mid-1960s in New York, where he encountered John Coltrane and other musicians, that he honed a new sound that he called Ethio-jazz-a marriage between the distinct pentatonic scales that define most traditional Ethiopian music and the kind that are the basis of most Western music. The result, as summarised by Ermanno Becchis, a producer, ""is sinuously scientific, but truly magical"".
Mulatu returned home to Ethiopia- and in the late 1960s and 1970s its capital earned the nickname ""Swinging Addis"". Nightlife flourished in a musical golden age, as did pioneering record labels such as Amha Records. ""People were having the time of their lives,"" Amha Eshete, the label's founder, recalls in a documentary about the period. Then, in 1974, Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown by a Marxist junta known as the Derg, which imposed new rules and curfews.
""The Derg's policies shut down most musical performances in Ethiopia between 1974 and 1991 and cut off contact with European and American popular-musical styles,"" explains Kay Kaufman Shelemay of Harvard University. Many artists went into exile; the emerging scene was quashed. Or so it seemed.
Like its birth, the revival of Ethio-jazz came about through travel and serendipity. At a party in Poitiers in the mid-1980s Francis Falceto, a French producer and musicologist, happened to hear the recorded voice of Mahmoud Ahmed, an Ethiopian singer. The Derg regime was ""a musical night- mare"", laments Mr Falceto, the tale's next hero. But in 1991 the junta was overthrown-and Mr Falceto could embark on his self-appointed mission to share modern Ethiopian music with the world. In 1997 he released the first volume of an anthology called ""Éthiopiques"".
Thirty more volumes have followed; the next, number 32, will be called ""Nalbandian the Ethiopian"" and commemorate Nerses Nalbandian, Mr Falceto says. Although, by his own account, he is ""getting old and a bit tired"", he hopes to put out four or five more volumes. But his series has already transformed the fortunes of Ethiopian artists. The fourth volume, featuring Mulatu, definitively put Ethio-jazz on the world map. After its release, Jim Jarmusch, a film director, used Mulatu's music on the soundtrack for ""Broken Flowers"", an award-winning film of 2005. The movie, says Ms Kaufman Shelemay of Harvard, brought Ethio-jazz to the ears of an even wider international audience.
For some outsiders, Ethiopia is predominantly associated with political strife- such as the bloody military action recently launched by the government in the Tigray region-and humanitarian crises. But another version of the country still thrums from the bars of Addis Ababa to the stages of Glastonbury. Hip-hop artists such as Kanye West have sampled Ethio-jazz on their tracks; the country's music schools continue to produce innovative performers. And a new generation of expatriate musicians has helped popularise a genre rooted in Africa but nurtured around the world. ""For people newly coming to it,"" says Berhana, a singer based in America, ""I love that it serves as an introduction to a music and culture that runs so deep."""

FORD PREFECT, an alien passing for a human in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", wonders about earthlings' peculiar ""habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in 'It's a nice day,' or 'You're very tall'."" He considers, then rejects the theory that human mouths seize up if not continually utilised, before concluding that if human beings ""don't keep on exercising their lips...their brains start working.""
With this observation the late Douglas Adams expressed a common highflown opinion about small talk: it is trivial, or perhaps worse, a substitute for real speech and thought. ""Should we talk about the weather?"" sings Michael Stipe of rem in ""Pop Song 89"". ""Should we talk about the government?"" Listeners are given to understand that little could be emptier than ""Hot out today, isn't it?"", or a casual political gripe.
Yet at the end of a year in which people around the world have mostly been deprived of face-to-face banter-and were forced under lockdown to concentrate on work, or on more intense conversations with family and close friends-many report feeling tired, bored, alienated and lonely. With luck, in 2021 more people will be back on trains and buses, and in offices, shops and restaurants-places where they will again engage in empty chatter. Research suggests they will benefit.
Nicholas Epley, a psychologist at the University of Chicago, undertook a study in the city in which a third of subjects had to strike up conversations on their commutes. (Two other groups were to stay silent or, acting as a control, to behave as normal.) Though many expressed horror at being required to disturb a stranger, those who did were happier than the other two groups. Lest you think this applies only to the garrulous, the moods of both self-described introverts and extroverts were boosted by a chat. A repeat of the experiment found almost exactly the same effects in England, supposedly an emotionally repressed sort of place. Mr Epley points out that even those who say they would themselves benefit from a friendly natter tend to underestimate how much others would enjoy one, too-meaning such chats are less likely to happen, a loss for everyone.
One reason for small talk's bad reputation is that it tends, for obvious reasons, to aim for the lowest common denominator. In ritualised dialogue, little information is exchanged. ""Hello"" signals nothing at all. ""How are you?"" rarely yields a fully honest answer. A perfectly logical or instrumental exchange, perhaps on Ford Prefect's planet near Betelgeuse, would jump right into a debate about string theory or the riddle of consciousness.
Back on Earth, linguists call that crucial ""hello"" talk ""phatic"". Bronislaw Malinowski, who coined the term in the 1920s, explained that in phatic talk ""ties of union are created by a mere exchange of words."" If you know literally nothing about someone you can still safely presume they prefer sun to rain, and begin to establish a connection on that basis. If your bus or train is suddenly stuck, an even better opportunity arises. You can be sure your fellow passengers are not happy about it, and a shared grousing session makes them-and you-feel less alone with your inconvenience.
At work, small talk may seem a distraction from what employees are paid to do. But there is a spectrum between empty talk (""Hello""), social talk (""How was your holiday?""), social talk relevant to work (""Is Sarah still on holiday?"") and pure business talk (""Has Sarah finished that report?""). A study of government departments in New Zealand by Janet Holmes shows how frequently people switch between those modes, even in brief conversations. That suggests a function beyond filling awkward gaps. Among other things, such chatter can bond equals together in a shared task. She also finds that bosses are more likely to initiate small talk with subordinates than the other way round (as well as to cut it off). This is because, even without being told, a good manager realises that it can soften a subsequent instruction.
Fans of ""Star Trek"" know that the Vulcans, even more than Adams's Betelgeusians, are the most logical beings in the known universe. But how do they take leave of each other? Not by coldly walking away, their business done. They exchange a ritualised ""Live long and prosper."" This is, strictly speaking, meaningless: the other Vulcan would naturally aim to do so without being told. But well-wishing binds people together, and thus has a value that even a Vulcan can see. Not so illogical after all."

JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH, an economist, once quipped that ""the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable."" With normal life thrown off course by covid-19, you might be forgiven for ignoring economists and studying the stars instead.
Prediction markets, which harness the collective wisdom of the crowd, offer another guide to the future. We consulted several platforms-Betfair, Metaculus, PredictIt and Smarkets-for signals on what 2021 will hold for business, politics, covid and culture. Many of these events are one-offs, so a lack of historical data makes prediction especially tricky. Still, with inoculations now being rolled out, these forecasts give some insight into what the ""new normal"" in 2021 might look like."

ON ONE OF his evening walks across the Arctic tundra, Barry Lopez found himself bowing. Not an extravagant thing, but from the waist, with his hands still in his pockets. He bowed to the horned lark he encountered on her ground nest, who returned his gaze with a stare as resolute as iron. He bowed to the golden plovers he surprised crying from their eggs, and to the eggs themselves, touched with a glow as soft and pure as in the paintings of Vermeer. When he came to a shred of musk-ox wool caught in the lavender flowers of saxifrage, he bowed to that, too.
By doing so, he surprised himself a little. But he kept the habit going. It was a gesture of respect for fecundity and beauty, for the mystery of these lives in a place that seemed barren. It was prompted, too, by the astonishing serenity and clarity of the Arctic light, a breathing light, pure as first-water diamonds. He felt wonder, and not only for small, close things. When he raised his field glasses he could see the true differentiated colours of the tundra, the bloom of glittering spray around caribou as they shook themselves, the several shades of grey in an iceberg, dove-grey and pearl and smoke, and the cobalt gleam of distant melt-ponds that held at their centres a core of aquamarine ice, like the heart of winter.
He went to the Arctic-as to the Antarctic, the Pacific northwest, Australia, the Galapagos, Africa-with the mental preparation of a scientist. Though he had not been trained as one, he had read widely, and could deploy anthropology, geology, biology and physics as they were needed. But he also deployed the eye of the boy who had wandered the creeks and rocks of the San Fernando Valley, and whose greatest joy had been to watch his pigeons flying. The book that resulted from his trip, ""Arctic Dreams"" (1986), carefully analysed the crystalline structure of rocks and ice, the habits of seals and the thermodynamic function of the hair of polar bears, but delighted equally in the still-mysterious: the life of the narwhal, less known than the rings of Saturn, or the migration of snow geese, which made him feel transcendent when he camped among them. Rationalism, charts and data sets could go only so far. They could not answer his abiding questions: how landscape shaped the people who lived in it, their ethics and imaginations, and how people's aspirations, in turn, affected landscape, until they were as much a part of it as the creatures were, or as the wind was. Science could not explain how some landscapes bestowed grace on the beholder, and called out goodness.
These concerns took him incessantly away, to more than 80 countries. The horizon had always beckoned, urging him to see what the skyline cordoned off, to leave the comfort zone of his white, middle-class upbringing and his conventional ideas. For a while the Catholic priesthood had tempted him, but he found even the life of a Trappist monk too easy. He was drawn instead to places, especially the polar regions, where in white-out blizzards the sense of time and space disappeared, and where sometimes the indifferent, unnamed, unmeasured wilderness seemed, in a strange way, to hold him safe. Gathering meteorites once with a scientific team in the Transantarctic Mountains, he was entranced not only by those stones from beyond the Earth but also by the terrestrial rocks he clambered over, each with distinct colours and angularities and each, to him, subliminally alive.
The mysterious worlds of wild animals drew him, too. For two years in Alaska he lived alongside wolves, observing but also personalising them, in an effort to correct human cruelty and false imaginings. Wolves, too, were part of the landscape they moved in, exactly fitted to it, and considered by the native tribes to be as various as clouds. Invading profiteers upset such subtle balances by drilling for oil, and dumping waste, in regions they assumed were just static dioramas and did not begin to understand.
At least the peoples of the Arctic still lived, to some degree, in harmony with their landscape. There was wisdom to be tapped, if he could get to it. In his writing he excoriated those who dismissed indigenous knowledge and storytelling, reminding them, again, how much they did not know. In a way he was an elder in his own place, the McKenzie river valley on the west slope of the Cascades in Oregon, simply by virtue of living there for 50 years. He knew the spawning places of the Chinook salmon, the haunts of ospreys, the favourite routes of bear and deer. However much he travelled, he kept those ties to his natural home, his native or hunter's eye. If he was blocked in his writing he would walk the banks to pick up a beaver stick, notched by the busy teeth of creatures who had no idea what angst was. If he needed wilderness again, where humans had never set foot, he could find it within a few steep miles.
Whether home or abroad, he saw himself as a man on the edge. The edge of tribal gatherings from which, like an ivory gull, he picked out whatever scraps he could; the edge of the United States; and the edge of the climate-change debate, from which he kept calling, hoping to be heard. The planet was in dire straits. In September the horror came right to his door, when a wildfire caused by years of drought roared along the river bank, destroying the shed that was his archive and, worse for him, 25 acres of mature temperate rainforest. But his message survived, in many forms. It was not angry, desperate though he felt sometimes; he wanted to elevate the conversation, unsettle the selfish, then offer comfort and help. As a writer, teacher and speaker, he saw that as his moral duty.
He fulfilled it by telling audiences what he had discovered on his journeys over the horizon: the proper balance, achieved by indigenous people, between community and autonomy; the wisdom of shamans and elders; the imperative to connect communities to their landscapes, the need to be ever-vigilant. It might be too late to apply this message in many places, but it could prompt, at least, a different perspective, a way to spark solutions that were not imagined yet. Above all he sought to foster a sense of awe before reality, a rekindling of amazement, and recognition of how much was still unknown; to treat its every wonder with respect and humility, as he had bowed to the horned lark."
